<p>We are told that nothing can travel faster than light. This is how we know it is true.</p>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>By Chris Baraniuk</li>
  </ul>
  2 May 2016 </div>
<div>
  <p>It was September 2011 and physicist Antonio Ereditato had just shocked the world.</p>
  <p>The   announcement he had made promised to overturn our understanding of the   Universe. If the data gathered by 160 scientists working on the <a href="https://www-opera.desy.de/project.html">OPERA project</a> were correct, the unthinkable had been observed.</p>
  <p>Particles – in this case, <a href="#" title="中微子">neutrinos</a> – had travelled faster than light.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> This time the scientists got it wrong </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>According   to Einstein's theories of relativity, this should not have been   possible. And the implications for showing it had happened were vast.   Many bits of physics might have to be reconsidered.</p>
  <p>Although Ereditato said that he and his team had &quot;high confidence&quot; in their result, they <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/the-data-that-threatened-to-break-physics">did not claim that they knew it was completely accurate</a>. In fact, they were asking for other scientists to help them understand what had happened.</p>
  <p>In   the end, it turned out the OPERA result was wrong. A timing problem had   been caused by a poorly connected cable that should have been   transmitting accurate signals from GPS satellites.</p>
  <p>There was an   unexpected delay in the signal. As a consequence, the measurements of   how long the neutrinos took to travel the given distance were off by   about 73 nanoseconds, making it look as though they had <a href="#" title="v.嗖嗖地移动；飞速行驶；快速地做；匆匆地干
n.能手；善于…的人">whizzed</a> along   more quickly than light could have done.</p>
  <p>Despite months of careful   checks prior to the experiment, and plentiful double-checking of the   data afterwards, this time the scientists got it wrong. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature.2012.10371">Ereditato resigned</a>, though many pointed out that mistakes like these happen all the time in the hugely complex machinery of particle accelerators.</p>
  <p>Why   was it such a big deal to suggest – even as a possibility – that   something had travelled faster than light? And are we really sure that   nothing can?</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Let's take the second of those questions first. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151027-how-far-does-light-travel-in-60s">speed of light in a vacuum</a> is 299,792.458 km per second – just shy of a nice round 300,000km/s   figure. That is pretty nippy. The Sun is 150 million km away from Earth   and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150728-travel-from-the-sun-to-jupiter">light takes just eight minutes and 20 seconds</a> to travel that far.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> He needed to use ever-larger amounts of additional energy to make ever-smaller differences to the speed </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Can   any of our own creations compete in a race with light? One of the   fastest human-made objects ever built, the New Horizons space probe, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150901-pluto-as-seen-by-new-horizons">passed by Pluto and Charon in July 2015</a>. It has reached a speed relative to the Earth of just over 16km/s, well below 300,000km/s.</p>
  <p>However,   we have made tiny particles travel much faster than that. In the early   1960s, William Bertozzi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology   experimented with <a href="http://education.jlab.org/scienceseries/ultimate_speed.html">accelerating electrons at greater and greater velocities</a>.</p>
  <p>Because   electrons have a charge that is negative, it is possible to propel – or   rather, repel – them by applying the same negative charge to a   material. The more energy applied, the faster the electrons will be   accelerated.</p>
  <p>You might imagine that you just need to increase the   energy applied in order to reach the required speed of 300,000km/s, but   it turns out that it just is not possible for electrons to move that   fast. Bertozzi's experiments found that using more energy did not simply   cause a directly proportional increase in electron speed.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> As objects travel faster and faster, they get heavier and heavier </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Instead,   he needed to use ever-larger amounts of additional energy to make   ever-smaller differences to the speed the electrons moved. They got   closer and closer to the speed of light but never quite reached it.</p>
  <p>Imagine   travelling towards a door in a series of moves, in each of which you   travel exactly half the distance between your current position and the   door. Strictly speaking, you will never reach the door, because after   every move you make you still have some distance still to travel. That   is the kind of problem Bertozzi encountered with his electrons.</p>
  <p>But   light is made up of particles called photons. Why can these particles   travel at the speed of light when particles like electrons cannot?</p>

  <p>&quot;As objects travel faster and faster, they get   heavier and heavier – the heavier they get, the harder it is to achieve   acceleration, so you never get to the speed of light,&quot; says <a href="http://directory.physics.unimelb.edu.au/view/person/roger">Roger Rassool</a>, a physicist at the University of Melbourne, Australia.</p>
  <p>&quot;A photon actually has no mass,&quot; he says. &quot;If it had mass, it couldn't travel at the speed of light.&quot;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> For the most part it is fair to say that light travels at 300,000km/s </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Photons   are pretty special. Not only do they have no mass, which gives them   free reign when it comes to zipping about in vacuums like space, they do   not have to speed up. The natural energy they possess, travelling as   they do in waves, means that the moment they are created, they are   already at top speed.</p>
  <p>In fact, in some ways it makes more sense to   think of light as energy rather than as a flow of particles, though   truthfully it is – a little confusingly – <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150731-what-is-a-ray-of-light-made-of">both</a>.</p>
  <p>Still,   light sometimes appears to travel more slowly than we might expect.   Although internet technicians like to talk about communications   travelling at &quot;the speed of light&quot; through optical fibres, light   actually travels around 40% slower through the glass of those fibres   than it would through a vacuum.</p>
  <p>In reality, the photons are still   travelling at 300,000km/s, but they are encountering a kind of   interference caused by other photons being released from the glass atoms   as the main light wave travels past. It is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiHN0ZWE5bk">tricky concept to get your head around</a>, but it is worth noting.</p>
  <p>Similarly, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-30944584">special experiments with individual photons have managed to slow them down by altering their shape</a>.</p>

  <p>Still, for the most part it is fair to say that   light travels at 300,000km/s. We really have not observed or created   anything that can go quite that quickly, or indeed more quickly. There   are a few special cases, mentioned below, but before those, let's tackle   that other question. Why is it so important that this speed of light   rule be so strict?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Even though the distance has increased, Einstein's theories insist that the light is still travelling at the same speed </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The answer lies, as so often in physics, with a man named <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151118-watch-this-video-to-understand-the-biggest-idea-in-physics">Albert Einstein</a>. His <a href="http://casa.colorado.edu/%7Eajsh/sr/postulate.html">theory of special relativity</a> explores many of the consequences of these universal speed limits.</p>
  <p>One   of the important elements in the theory is the idea that the speed of   light is a constant. No matter where you are or how fast you are   travelling, light always travels at the same speed.</p>
  <p>But that creates some conceptual problems.</p>
  <p>Imagine   shining light from a torch up to a mirror on the ceiling of a   stationary spacecraft. The light will shine upwards, reflect off the   mirror, and come down to hit the floor of the spacecraft. Let's say the   distance travelled is 10m.</p>
  <p>Now let's imagine that the spacecraft begins travelling at a hair-raising speed, many thousands of kilometres per second.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Time travels slower for people travelling in fast-moving vehicles </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When   you shine the torch again, the light will still seem to behave as   before: it will shine upwards, hit the mirror, and bounce back to hit   the floor. But in order to do so the light will have to travel   diagonally rather than just vertically. After all, the mirror is now   moving quickly along with the spacecraft.</p>
  <p>The distance the light   travels therefore increases. Let's imagine it has increased overall by   5m. That is 15m in total, instead of 10m.</p>
  <p>And yet, even though the   distance has increased, Einstein's theories insist that the light is   still travelling at the same speed. Since speed is distance divided by   time, for the speed to be the same but the distance to have increased,   time must also have increased.</p>
  <p>Yes, time itself must have got stretched. That sounds wacky, but <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.177.4044.168">it has been proved experimentally</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>It is a phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Relative_velocity_time_dilation">time dilation</a>. It means time travels slower for people travelling in fast-moving vehicles, relative to those who are stationary.</p>
  <p>For example, time runs <a href="http://ideonexus.com/2009/02/17/how-much-does-time-dilate-for-the-iss-astronauts/">0.007 seconds slower for astronauts on the International Space Station</a>, which is moving at 7.66 km/s relative to Earth, compared to people on the planet.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The muons are generated with so much energy that they're moving at velocities very near the speed of light </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Things   get interesting for particles, like the electrons mentioned above, that   can travel close to the speed of light. For these particles, the degree   of time dilation can be great.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/kolthammer">Steven Kolthammer</a>, an experimental physicist at the University of Oxford in the UK, points to an example involving particles called muons.</p>
  <p>Muons   are unstable: they quickly fall apart into simpler particles. So   quickly, in fact, that most muons leaving the Sun should have decayed   away by the time they reach the Earth. But in reality muons arrive at   Earth from the Sun in great numbers. This was something scientists long   found difficult to understand.</p>
  <p>&quot;The answer to this puzzle is that   the muons are generated with so much energy that they're moving at   velocities very near the speed of light,&quot; says Kolthammer. &quot;So their   sense of time, if you will, their internal clock, actually runs slow.&quot;</p>
  <p>The muons were &quot;kept alive&quot; longer than expected, relative to us, thanks to <a href="http://www.alternativephysics.org/book/MuonRelativity.htm">a real, natural bending of time</a>.</p>

  <p>When objects move quickly relative to other   objects, their length contracts as well. These consequences, time   dilation and length contraction, are both examples of how space-time   changes based on the motion of things – like you, me or a spacecraft –   that have mass.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> There are galaxies in the Universe moving away from one another at a velocity greater than the speed of light </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Crucially,   as Einstein said, light does not get affected in the same way – because   it has no mass. That is why it is so important that all of these   principles go hand-in-hand. If things could travel faster than light,   they would disobey these fundamental laws that describe how the Universe   works.</p>
  <p>That sums up the key principles. At this point, we can consider a few exceptions and caveats.</p>
  <p>For   one thing, while nothing has ever been observed travelling faster than   light, that does not mean it is not theoretically possible to break this   speed limit in very special circumstances.</p>
  <p>Take, for instance, the expansion of the Universe itself. There are galaxies in the Universe <a href="http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/104-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/expansion-of-the-universe/616-is-the-universe-expanding-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-intermediate">moving away from one another at a velocity greater than the speed of light</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> There is yet another possible way in which faster-than-light travel is technically possible </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Another   interesting situation concerns particles that seem to be expressing the   same properties at the same time, no matter how far apart they are.</p>
  <p>This   is called &quot;quantum entanglement&quot;. In essence, a photon will flip back   and forth between two possible states at random – but the flips will   exactly mirror the flipping of another photon somewhere else, if the two   are entangled.</p>
  <p>Two scientists each studying their own photon will   therefore get the same results at the same time, faster than the speed   of light.</p>
  <p>However, in both these examples it is crucial to note   that no information is travelling faster than the speed of light between   two entities. We can calculate the Universe's expansion, but we cannot   observe any faster-than-light objects in it: they have disappeared from   view.</p>

  <p>As for the two scientists with their photons,   while they might achieve the same result simultaneously, they could not   confirm the fact with each other any more quickly than light could   travel between them.</p>
  <p>&quot;This gets us out of any problems, because if   you are able to send signals faster than light you can construct   bizarre paradoxes, under which information can somehow go backwards in   time,&quot; says Kolthammer.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> What if instead you actively distorted space-time in a controlled way? </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There   is yet another possible way in which faster-than-light travel is   technically possible: rifts in space-time itself that allow a voyager to   escape the rules of normal travel.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.baylor.edu/physics/index.php?id=68540">Gerald Cleaver</a> at Baylor University in Texas has considered the possibility that we   might one day build a faster-than-light spacecraft. One of the ways to   do this might be to travel through a wormhole. These are loops in   space-time, perfectly consistent with Einstein's theories, which could   allow an astronaut to hop from one bit of the Universe to another via an   anomaly in space-time, a sort of cosmic shortcut.</p>
  <p>The object   travelling through the wormhole would not exceed the speed of light, but   it could theoretically reach a certain destination faster than light   could if it took a &quot;normal&quot; route.</p>
  <p>But wormholes might not be   available for space travel. What if instead you actively distorted   space-time in a controlled way, to travel faster than 300,000km/s   relative to someone else?</p>

  <p>Cleaver has investigated an idea known as an &quot;Alcubierre drive&quot;, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001">proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994</a>.   Essentially, it describes a situation in which space-time is squashed   in front of a spacecraft, pulling it forward, while space-time behind   the craft is expanded, creating a pushing effect.</p>
  <p>&quot;But then,&quot; says Cleaver, &quot;there's the issues of how to do that, and how much energy it's going to take.&quot;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Faster-than-light travel remains a fantasy at the moment </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In 2008, he and graduate student Richard Obousy <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1957">calculated some of the energies involved</a>.</p>
  <p>&quot;We   worked out that, if you assume a ship that's about 10m x 10m x 10m –   you're talking 1,000 cubic metres – that the amount of energy it would   take to start the process would need to be on the order of the entire   mass of Jupiter.&quot;</p>
  <p>After that, the energy would have to continue   being provided constantly in order to ensure the process did not fail.   No-one knows how that would ever be possible, or what the technology to   do it would look like.</p>
  <p>&quot;I don't want to be misquoted centuries   from now for predicting it would never come about,&quot; says Cleaver, &quot;but   right now I don't see solutions.&quot;</p>
  <p>Faster-than-light travel, then, remains a fantasy at the moment.</p>
  <p>But   while that may sound disappointing, light is anything but. In fact, for   most of this article we have been thinking in terms of visible light.   But really light is much, much more than that.</p>

  <p>Everything from radio waves to microwaves to   visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and the gamma rays emitted   by decaying atoms – all of these fantastic rays are made of the same   stuff: photons.</p>
  <p>The difference is the energy, and therefore their wavelength. Collectively these rays make up the <a href="http://www.darvill.clara.net/emag/">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. The fact that radio waves, for instance, travel at the speed of light is enormously useful for communications.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Space-time is malleable and that allows for everyone to experience the same laws of physics </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In   his research, Kolthammer builds circuitry that uses photons to send   signals from one part of the circuit to another, so he is well placed to   comment on the usefulness of light's awesome speed.</p>
  <p>&quot;The idea   that we've built the infrastructure of the internet for example and even   before that, radio, based on light, certainly has to do with the ease   with which we can transmit it,&quot; he points out.</p>
  <p>He adds that light   acts as a communicating force for the Universe. When electrons in a   mobile phone mast jiggle, photons fly out and make other electrons in   your mobile phone jiggle too. It is this process that lets you make a   phone call.</p>
  <p>The jiggling of electrons in the Sun also emits   photons – at fantastic rates – which, of course, produces the light that   nourishes life on Earth.</p>
  <p>Light is the Universe's broadcast. That   speed – 299,792.458 km/s – remains reassuringly constant. Meanwhile,   space-time is malleable and that allows for everyone to experience the   same laws of physics no matter their position or motion.</p>
  <p>Who would want to travel faster than light, anyway? The show it puts on is just too good to miss.</p>
