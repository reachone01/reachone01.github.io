<p>It's all around us and allows us to see the world. But most of us would struggle to explain what light actually is.</p>
<p>By Colin Barras</p>
<p>31 July 2015</p>
  <p>Light is what allows us to understand the   world we live in. Our language reflects this: after groping in the   dark, we see the light and understanding dawns.</p>
  <p>Yet light is one   of those things that we don't tend to understand. If you were to zoom in   on a ray of light, what would you see? Sure, light travels incredibly   fast, but what is it that's doing the travelling? Many of us would   struggle to explain.</p>
  <p>It doesn't have to be that way. Light   certainly has puzzled the greatest minds for centuries, but landmark   discoveries made over the last 150 years have robbed light of its   mystery. We actually know, more or less, what it is.</p>
  <p>Not only do   today's physicists understand the nature of light, they are learning to   control it with ever-greater precision – which means light could soon be   put to work in surprising new ways. That is part of the reason why the   United Nations designated 2015 as the <a href="http://www.light2015.org/Home.html">International Year of Light</a>.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>There are all sorts of ways to describe light. But it might help to begin with this: <strong>light is a form of <a href="#" title="辐射；放射线；辐射的热（或能量等）；放射疗法.">radiation</a></strong>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> It wasn't until the late nineteenth century that scientists discovered the exact identity of light radiation</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This   hopefully makes some sense. We all know that too much sunlight can   trigger skin cancer. We also know that radiation exposure can raise the   risk of developing some forms of cancer, so it's not hard to put the two   together.</p>
  <p>But not all forms of radiation are the same. It wasn't   until the late nineteenth century that scientists discovered the exact   identity of light radiation.</p>
  <p>The strange thing is, this discovery   didn't come from the study of light. Instead it emerged from decades of   work into the nature of electricity and magnetism.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Electricity and magnetism seem like quite different   things. But scientists like <a href="#" title="汉斯·克里斯蒂安·奥斯特；丹麦物理学家奥斯特">Hans Christian Oersted</a> and <a href="#" title="迈克尔·法拉第">Michael Faraday</a>   established that they are deeply <a href="#" title="美 [ɪn'twaɪn]
英 [ɪn'twaɪn]

    v.缠绕；盘绕；与…密切相关（或紧密相联）">entwined</a>.</p>
  <p>Oersted found that an   electric current passing through a wire <a href="#" title="美 [dɪ'flekt]
英 [dɪ'flekt]

    v.转向；转移；引开；阻止（某人做已决定做的事）">deflects</a> the needle of a   magnetic compass. Meanwhile, Faraday discovered that moving a magnet   near a wire can generate an electric current in the wire.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields travel in the manner of waves </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Mathematicians   of the day set about using these observations to create a theory   describing this strange new phenomenon, which they called   &quot;electromagnetism&quot;. But it wasn't until James Clerk Maxwell looked at   the problem that a complete picture emerged.</p>
  <p>Maxwell's contribution to science is huge. Albert Einstein, who was inspired by Maxwell, said that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/people/james_clerk_maxwell">he changed the world forever</a>. Among many other things, his calculations helped explain what light is.</p>
  <p>Maxwell   showed that electric and magnetic fields travel in the manner of waves,   and that those waves move essentially at the speed of light. This   allowed Maxwell to predict that light itself was carried by   electromagnetic waves – which means <strong>light is a form of electromagnetic radiation</strong>.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>In the late 1880s, a few years after Maxwell's   death, German physicist Heinrich Hertz became the first to formally   demonstrate that Maxwell's theoretical concept of the electromagnetic   wave was correct.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> In 1861 he unveiled the first durable colour photograph </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;I   am convinced that if Maxwell and Hertz had lived into the Nobel prize   era, they would have surely shared one,&quot; says Graham Hall of the   University of Aberdeen in the UK – <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2007.2192">where Maxwell worked in the late 1850s</a>.</p>
  <p>Maxwell   holds a place in the annals of light science for another, more   practical reason. In 1861 he unveiled the first durable colour   photograph, produced using a three-colour filter system that still forms   the basis of many forms of colour photography today.</p>
  <p>Still, the   idea that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation may not mean too   much. But this idea helps to explain something that we all understand: <strong>light is a spectrum of colours</strong>.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>This is an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00ccpg2">observation that goes back to the work of Isaac Newton</a>.   We see this colour spectrum in all its glory whenever a rainbow hangs   in the sky – and those colours relate directly to Maxwell's concept of   electromagnetic waves.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Many animals can actually see ultraviolet, and so can some people </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   red light along one edge of the rainbow is electromagnetic radiation   with a wavelength of about 620 to 750 nanometres; the violet light along   the opposite edge is radiation with a wavelength of 380 to 450nm.</p>
  <p>But   there is far more to electromagnetic radiation than these visible   colours. Light with wavelengths slightly longer than the red light we   see is called infrared. Light with wavelengths slightly shorter than   violet is called ultraviolet.</p>
  <p><a href="http://io9.com/most-animals-can-see-the-flashing-and-glowing-of-power-1543142602">Many animals can actually see ultraviolet</a>, and so can some people, says <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eleftherios_Goulielmakis">Eleftherios Goulielmakis</a> of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany. In some circumstances <a href="http://io9.com/under-the-right-conditions-humans-can-see-infrared-1665448040">even infrared is visible to humans</a>. Perhaps this is why it's not uncommon to see both ultraviolet and infrared described as forms of light.</p>
  <p>Curiously, though, go to even longer – or shorter – electromagnetic wavelengths and we stop using the word &quot;light&quot;.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Beyond ultraviolet, electromagnetic wavelengths can   go shorter than 100nm. This is the realm of X-rays and gamma rays. You   won't often hear X-rays described as a form of light.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> There is no real physical difference between radio waves and visible light </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;A scientist wouldn't say 'I'm shining X-ray light on the target'. They would say 'I'm using X-rays',&quot; says Goulielmakis.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,   go beyond infrared and electromagnetic wavelength stretches to 1cm and   even up to thousands of kilometres. These electromagnetic waves are   given familiar names like microwaves and radio waves. It may seem   strange to think of the radio waves used in broadcasting as light.</p>
  <p>&quot;There   is no real physical difference between radio waves and visible light   from the point of view of physics,&quot; says Goulielmakis. &quot;You would   describe them with exactly the same sort of equations and mathematics.&quot;   It's only our everyday language that treats them as different.</p>
  <p>So   we have another definition of light. It is the very narrow range of   electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can actually see. In other   words, <strong>light is a subjective label that we only use because our senses are limited</strong>.</p>
  <p>For more evidence of just how <a href="#" title="主观的（非客观的）；主观的（非现实世界的）；主语的；主格的">subjective</a> our concept of light is, think back to the rainbow.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Most people learn that the spectrum of light   contains seven main colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, <a href="#" title="美 ['ɪndɪɡoʊ]
英 ['ɪndɪɡəʊ]
    n.靛蓝；靛蓝类染料；一种深蓝色；【植】能产生靛蓝的植物">indigo</a>   and violet. We are even given handy <a href="#" title="mnemonic
美 [nɪ'mɑnɪk]
英 [nɪ'mɒnɪk]

    adj.记忆的；记忆术的；增进记忆的">mnemonics</a> and songs to remember   them.</p>
  <p>Look at a strong rainbow and you can probably convince   yourself that all seven colours are on show. However, Newton himself   struggled to see them all.</p>
  <p>In fact, researchers now suspect that he only divided the rainbow into seven colours because <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/col.5080100411">the number seven was so significant in the ancient world</a>: for instance there are seven notes in a musical scale, and seven days in a week.</p>
  <p>Maxwell's   work on electromagnetism took us past all this, and showed that visible   light was part of a larger spectrum of radiation. It also seemed to   finally explain the nature of light.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>For centuries, scientists had been trying to pin   down the actual form that light takes at a fundamental scale as it   travels from a light source to our eyes.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Newton realised that rays of light obeyed very strict geometric rules </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Some   thought that light travelled in the form of waves or ripples, either   through air or a more <a href="#" title="美 ['nebjələs]
英 ['nebjʊləs]

    adj.模糊的；不清楚的
    网络星云的；朦胧的；模糊不清的">nebulous</a> &quot;ether&quot;. Others thought this wave model   was wrong and imagined light as a stream of tiny particles.</p>
  <p>Newton preferred this second option, particularly after a series of experiments he performed using light and mirrors.</p>
  <p>He realised that rays of light obeyed very strict geometric rules. Shine a ray against a mirror and it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO2uyvf-E3k">bounced off in exactly the same way a ball would if it were thrown against the mirror</a>.   Waves don't necessarily move in such predictable straight lines, he   reasoned, so light must be carried by some form of tiny, weightless   particles.</p>
  <p>The trouble is, there was equally <a href="#" title="引人入胜的；扣人心弦的；非常强烈的；不可抗拒的">compelling</a> evidence that light is a wave.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>One of the most famous demonstrations of this came   in 1801. Thomas Young's &quot;double <a href="#" title="美 [slɪt]
英 [slɪt]

    n.狭缝；裂缝；狭长的切口；长而窄的口子
    v.在…上开狭长口子；切开；划破">slit</a> <a href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/1036100.htm">experiment</a>&quot; is the sort of   experiment anyone can replicate at home.</p>
  <p>Take a sheet of thick   card and carefully make two thin vertical slits through it. Then get a   &quot;coherent&quot; light source, which only produces light of a particular   wavelength: a laser will do nicely. Now shine the light through the two   slits onto another surface.</p>
  <p>On that second surface, you might   expect to see two bright vertical lines where some of the light has   passed through the two slits. But when Young performed the experiment,   he saw a sequence of light and dark lines rather like a bar code.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>When the light passes through the thin slits, it   behaves in the same way that water waves do when they pass through a   narrow opening: they <a href="#" title="美 
英 [dɪ'frækt]

    v.（使光束）衍射
    网络分解；绕射；分散">diffract</a> and spread out in the form of   hemispherical ripples.</p>
  <p>Where the &quot;light ripples&quot; from the two   slits hit each other <a href="#" title="out of phase

    网络反相；反相位；不同相">out of phase</a> they <a href="#" title="相约；相消；抵消">cancel out</a>, forming dark bars.   Where the ripples hit each other in phase, they add together to made   bright vertical lines.</p>
  <p>Young's experiment was compelling evidence of the wave model, and Maxwell's work put the idea on a solid mathematical footing. <strong>Light is a wave</strong>.</p>
  <p>But then came the quantum revolution.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>In the second half of the nineteenth century,   physicists were trying to understand how and why some materials absorbed   and emitted electromagnetic radiation better than others.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> In 1900, Max Planck solved the problem </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That   may sound a bit niche, but the electric light industry was emerging at   the time, so materials that could emit light were a big thing.</p>
  <p>By the end of the nineteenth century, <a href="http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/black_body_radiation.html">scientists   had discovered that the amount of electromagnetic radiation released by   an object changed depending on its temperature</a>, and they had measured these changes. But no one knew why it happened.</p>
  <p>In   1900, Max Planck solved the problem. He discovered that the   calculations could explain those changes, but only if he assumed that   the electromagnetic radiation was held in tiny discrete packets. Planck   called these &quot;quanta&quot;, the plural of &quot;quantum&quot;.</p>
  <p>A few years later, Einstein used this idea to explain another puzzling experiment.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Physicists had discovered that a chunk of metal   becomes positively charged when it is bathed in visible or ultraviolet   light. They called this the &quot;<a href="http://physics.info/photoelectric/">photoelectric effect</a>&quot;.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> This doesn't make much sense if light is simply a wave </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The   explanation was that atoms in the metal were losing negatively-charged   electrons. Apparently, the light delivered enough energy to the metal to   shake some of them loose.</p>
  <p>But the detail of what the electrons   were doing was odd. They could be made to carry more energy simply by   changing the colour of light. In particular, the electrons released from   a metal bathed in violet light carried more energy than electrons   released by a metal bathed in red light.</p>
  <p>This doesn't make much sense if light is simply a wave.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>You usually change the amount of energy in a wave by   making it taller – think of the destructive power of a tall <a href="#" title="美 [tsuˈnɑmi]
英 [tsuːˈnɑːmi]

    n.海啸">tsunami</a> –   rather than by making the wave itself longer or shorter.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Each quantum packs a discrete energy <a href="#" title="punch
美 [pʌntʃ]
英 [pʌntʃ]

    n.冲床；重拳击打；用力的捶打；吸引力">punch</a> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By   extension, the best way to increase the energy that light transfers to   the electrons should be by making the light waves taller: that is,   making the light brighter. Changing the wavelength, and thus the colour,   shouldn't make as much of a difference.</p>
  <p>Einstein realised that the photoelectric effect was easier to understand by thinking of light in terms of Planck's quanta.</p>
  <p>He   suggested that light is carried in tiny quantum packets. Each quantum   packs a discrete energy punch that relates to the wavelength: the   shorter the wavelength, the denser the energy punch. This would explain   why violet light packets, with a relatively short wavelength, carried   more energy than red light packets, with a relatively longer one.</p>
  <p>It also explained why simply increasing the brightness of the light made less of an impact.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>A brighter light source delivers more light packets   to the metal, but it doesn't change the amount of energy each light   packet contains. Crudely speaking, a single violet light packet could   transfer more energy to a single electron than any number of red light   packets.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The scientists decided that light behaved as both a wave and a particle at the same time </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Einstein   called these energy packets <a href="photon
美 ['foʊ.tɑn]
英 ['fəʊtɒn]

    n.光子；光量子">photons</a>, and these are now recognised as a   fundamental particle. Visible light is carried by photons, and so are   all the other kinds of electromagnetic radiation like X-rays, microwaves   and radio waves. In other words, <strong>light is a particle</strong>.</p>
  <p>At   this point physicists decided to end the debate over whether light   behaved as a wave or a particle. Both models were so convincing that   neither could be rejected.</p>
  <p>To the confusion of many   non-physicists, the scientists decided that light behaved as both a wave   and a particle at the same time. In other words, <strong>light is a paradox</strong>.</p>
  <p>Physicists,   though, have no problem with light's split identity. If anything, it   makes light doubly useful. Today, building on the work of <a href="#" title="美 ['lumɪ.neri]
英 ['luːmɪnəri]

    n.专家；权威；有影响的人物">luminaries</a> –   literally &quot;light-givers&quot; – like Maxwell and Einstein, we are squeezing   even more out of light.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>It turns out that the equations used to describe   light-as-a-wave and light-as-a-particle work equally well, but in some   circumstances one is easier to use than the other. So physicists switch   between them, just as we use metres to describe our own height but   switch to kilometres to describe a bicycle ride.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Entangled particles can be used to communicate information </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Some physicists are trying to use light to create encrypted channels of communication: <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4914-entangled-photons-secure-money-transfer/">for money transfers, for instance</a>. For them, it makes sense to think of light as particles.</p>
  <p>This   is because of another strange quirk of quantum physics. Two fundamental   particles, like a pair of photons, can be &quot;entangled&quot;. This means they   share properties no matter how far apart they are from one another, so   they can be used to communicate information between two points on Earth.</p>
  <p>Another   feature of this entanglement is that the quantum state of the photons   changes when they are read. That means if anyone tried to <a href="#" title="美 ['ivz.drɑp]
英 ['iːvz.drɒp]

    v.偷听
    n.檐水">eavesdrop</a> on a   channel encrypted using the quantum properties of light, they would, in   theory, immediately betray their presence.</p>
  <p>Others, like   Goulielmakis, are using light in electronics. For them it is far more   useful to think of light as a series of waves that can be tamed and   controlled.</p>
  <div> </div>
  <p>Modern devices called &quot;light field synthesisers&quot; can   <a href="#" title="美 [kə'ræl]
英 [kə'rɑːl]

    n.围栏
    v.把（马或牛）赶入围栏（或关进畜栏）">corral</a> light waves into perfect synchrony with each other. As a result,   they create light pulses that are far more intense, short-lived and   directed than the light from an ordinary bulb.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> They literally took photos of light waves moving </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Over the last 15 years, these devices have been used to tame light to an extraordinary degree.</p>
  <p>In   2004 Goulielmakis and his colleagues managed to produce incredibly   short pulses of X-ray radiation. Each pulse lasted just 250 attoseconds,   or 250 quintillionths of a second.</p>
  <p>Using these tiny pulses like a camera flash, they managed to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1100866">capture images of individual waves of visible light</a>, which oscillate rather slower. They literally took photos of light waves moving.</p>
  <p>&quot;We've   known since Maxwell that light is an oscillating electromagnetic field,   but nobody dreamed we would be able to capture the light as it   oscillates,&quot; says Goulielmakis.</p>
  <p>Seeing those individual light waves is a first step towards controlling and sculpting them, he says, much as we already <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio.htm">sculpt much longer electromagnetic waves, like the radio waves that carry radio and television signals</a>.</p>

  <p>A century ago, the photoelectric effect showed that   visible light affects the electrons in a metal. Goulielmakis says it   should be possible to precisely manipulate those electrons, using   visible light waves that have been shaped to interact with the metals in   a carefully defined way. &quot;We can control the light, and through it we   can control matter,&quot; he says.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Human eyes are photon detectors that use visible light to learn about the world around us </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That   could revolutionise electronics, leading to new generations of optical   computers that are smaller and faster than those we have today. &quot;It's   about setting electrons in motion in ways we want, creating electric   currents inside solids using light, instead of conventional   electronics.&quot;</p>
  <p>So there is one more way light can be described: <strong>light is a tool</strong>.</p>
  <p>That   is nothing new. Life has been harnessing light ever since the first   primitive organisms evolved light-sensitive tissues. Human eyes are   photon detectors that use visible light to learn about the world around   us.</p>
  <p>Modern technology is simply taking this idea even further. In 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2014/press.html">researchers who built a light microscope so powerful, it was thought to be physically impossible</a>. It turned out that, with a bit of persuasion, light would show us things we thought we would never see.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150731-what-is-a-ray-of-light-made-of">reference</a></p>
