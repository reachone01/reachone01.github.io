<div class='layout'><p>26 END OF THE SEARCH</p><p>第26章 寻找结束</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was not a word to be said. The echoes of the blast rolled away into the outer rooms and rumbled downward into a hoarse, dying whisper. Before its death, it had muffled the sharp clamor of Bayta's falling blaster, smothered Magnifico's high-pitched cry, drowned out Toran's inarticulate roar.</p><p>没有任何人说任何一句话。轰击的回声一波波传到外面各个房间，渐渐变成愈来愈小而模糊不清的隆隆声。而回声在完全消逝前，还来得及掩盖贝泰的手铳掉落地板的声响，压制马巨擘高亢的惨叫，并且淹没杜伦含糊的怒吼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was a silence of agony.</p><p>接着，是好一阵子凝重的死寂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bayta's head was bent into obscurity. A droplet caught the light as it fell. Bayta had never wept since her childhood.</p><p>贝泰的头低垂下来。灯光照不到她的脸，却将半空中一滴泪珠映得闪闪生辉。自从长大后，贝泰从来没有哭过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran's muscles almost cracked in their spasm, but he did not relax……he felt as if he would never unclench his teeth again. Magnifico's face was a faded, lifeless mask.</p><p>杜伦的肌肉拼命抽搐，几乎就要爆裂，他却没有放松的意思……他觉得咬紧的牙齿似乎再也不会张开。马巨擘的脸庞则一片死灰，像是一副毫无生气的假面具。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Finally, from between teeth still tight, Toran choked out in an unrecognizable voice, "You're a Mule's woman, then. He got to you!"</p><p>杜伦终于从紧咬着的牙关中，硬挤出一阵含混的声音。“原来你已经是骡的女人，他征服了你！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bayta looked up, and her mouth twisted with a painful merriment, "I, a Mule's woman? That's ironic."</p><p>贝泰抬起头，撅着嘴，发出一阵痛苦的狂笑。“我，是骡的女人？这太讽刺了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She smiled……a brittle effort……and tossed her hair back. Slowly, her voice verged back to the normal, or something near it. "It's over, Toran; I can talk now. How much I will survive, I don't know. But I can start talking……"</p><p>她勉强露出一丝微笑，并将头发向后甩。渐渐地，她的声音恢复正常，或说接近正常。“杜伦，一切都结束了；现在我可以说了。我还能活多久，自己也不知道。但至少我可以开始说……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran's tension had broken of its own weight and faded into a flaccid dullness, "Talk about what, Bay? What's there to talk about?"</p><p>杜伦紧绷的肌肉松弛下来，变得软弱无力又毫无生气。“贝，你要说什么？还有什么好说的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"About the calamity that's followed us. We've remarked about it before, Torie. Don't you remember? How defeat has always bitten at our heels and never actually managed to nip us? We were on the Foundation, and it collapsed while the Independent Traders still fought……but we got out in time to go to Haven. We were on Haven, and it collapsed while the others still fought……and again we got out in time. We went to Neotrantor, and by now it's undoubtedly joined the Mule."</p><p>“我要说说那些尾随我们的灾难。杜，我们以前曾经讨论过，你不记得了吗？为什么敌人总是跟在我们的脚后跟，却从来没有真正抓到我们。我们到过基地，不久基地就沦陷了，当时独立行商仍在奋战……但我们及时逃到赫汶。当其他的行商世界仍在顽抗时，赫汶却率先瓦解……而我们又一次及时逃脱。我们去了新川陀，如今新川陀无疑也投靠了骡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran listened and shook his head, "I don't understand."</p><p>杜伦仔细听完，摇了摇头。“我不明白你的意思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Torie, such things don't happen in real life. You and I are insignificant people; we don't fall from one vortex of politics into another continuously for the space of a year……unless we carry the vortex with us. Unless we carry the source of infection with us! Now do you see?"</p><p>“杜，这种境遇不可能出现在真实生活中。你我只是微不足道的小人物，不可能在短短一年间，太空啊，不停地卷入一个又一个的政治漩涡……除非我们带着那个漩涡打转。除非我们随身带着那个祸源！现在你明白了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran's lips tightened. His glance fixed horribly upon the bloody remnants of what had once been a human, and his eyes sickened.</p><p>杜伦紧抿嘴唇，目光凝注在一团血肉模糊的尸块上。几分钟前，那还是个活生生的人，他感到无比的恐怖与恶心。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Let's get out of here, Bay. Let's get out into the open."</p><p>“让我们出去，贝，让我们到外面去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was cloudy outside. The wind scudded about them in drab spurts and disordered Bayta's hair. Magnifico had crept after them and now he hovered at the edge of their conversation.</p><p>外面是阴天。阵阵微风轻轻拂过，吹乱了贝泰的头发。马巨擘蹑手蹑脚地跟在他们后面，在勉强听得到他们谈话的距离，他心神不宁地来回走动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran said tightly, "You killed Ebling Mis because you believed him to be the focus of infection?" Something in her eyes struck him. He whispered, "He was the Mule?" He did not……could not……believe the implications of his own words.</p><p>杜伦以紧绷的声音说：“你杀了艾布林·米斯，是因为你相信他就是那个祸源？”他以为从她眼中得到了答案，又悄声说：“他就是骡？”他虽然这么说，却不相信……不能相信自己这句话的含意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bayta laughed sharply, "Poor Ebling the Mule? Galaxy, no! I couldn't have killed him if he were the Mule. He would have detected the emotion accompanying the move and changed it for me to love, devotion, adoration, terror, whatever he pleased. No, I killed Ebling because he was not the Mule. I killed him because he knew where the Second Foundation was, and in two seconds would have told the Mule the secret."</p><p>贝泰突然尖声大笑。“可怜的艾布林是骡？银河啊，不对！假使他是骡，我不可能杀得了他。他会及时察觉伴随着动作的情感变化，将它转化成敬爱、忠诚、崇拜、恐惧，随他高兴。不，我会杀死艾布林，正因为他并不是骡。我杀死他，是因为他已经知道第二基地的位置，再迟两秒钟，他就会把这个秘密告诉骡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Would have told the Mule the secret," Toran repeated stupidly. "Told the Mule?</p><p>“就会把这个秘密告诉骡……”杜伦傻愣愣地重复着这句话，“告诉骡……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then he emitted a sharp cry, and turned to stare in horror at the clown, who might have been crouching unconscious there for the apparent understanding he had of what he heard.</p><p>他忽然发出一声尖叫，露出恐惧的表情，转身向小丑望去。假如马巨擘听到他们说些什么，一定会吓得缩成一团，人事不省。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not Magnifico?" Toran whispered the question.</p><p>“不会是马巨擘吧？”杜伦悄声问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Listen!" said Bayta. "Do you remember what happened on Neotrantor? Oh, think for yourself, Torie……"</p><p>“听好！”贝泰说，“你还记不记得在新川陀发生的事？喔，杜，你自己想想看……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But he shook his head and mumbled at her.</p><p>他仍旧摇了摇头，喃喃地反驳她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She went on, wearily, "A man died on Neotrantor. A man died with no one touching him. Isn't that true? Magnifico played on his Visi-Sonor and when he was finished, the crown prince was dead. Now isn't that strange? Isn't it queer that a creature afraid of everything, apparently helpless with terror, has the capacity to kill at will."</p><p>贝泰不耐烦地继续说：“在新川陀，有个人在我们面前暴毙。根本没有任何人碰到他，我说得对不对？马巨擘只是演奏声光琴，而他停止的时候，那个皇储就死了。这还不奇怪吗？一个什么都怕、动不动就吓得发抖的人，竟然有本事随心所欲置人于死地，这难道不诡异吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The music and the light-effects," said Toran, "have a profound emotional effect……"</p><p>“那种音乐和光影的效果……”杜伦说，“能对情感产生深厚的影响……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, an emotional effect. A pretty big one. Emotional effects happen to be the Mule's specialty. That, I suppose, can be considered a coincidence. And a creature who can kill by suggestion is so full of fright. Well, the Mule tampered with his mind, supposedly, so that can be explained. But, Toran, I caught a little of that Visi-Sonor selection that killed the crown prince. Just a little……but it was enough to give me that same feeling of despair I had in the Time Vault and on Haven. Toran, I can't mistake that particular feeling."</p><p>“是的，对情感产生影响，而且效果极大。而影响他人的情感，正好是骡的专长。我想，这点还能视为巧合。马巨擘能借着暗示取人性命，本身却充满了恐惧。嗯，多半是骡影响了他的心智，这还可以解释得通。可是，杜伦，杀死皇储的那段声光琴演奏，我自己也接触了一点。只是一点点……却足以使我又感到那种绝望，它和当初我在时光穹窿中、在赫汶星上感受到的一模一样。杜伦，那种特殊的感受，我是不可能弄错的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran's face was darkening. "I……felt it, too. I forgot. I never thought……"</p><p>杜伦的脸色变得愈来愈凝重。“我……当初也感觉到了。不过我忘了，我从未想到……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was then that it first occurred to me. It was just a vague feeling……intuition, if you like. I had nothing to go on. And then Pritcher told us of the Mule and his mutation, and it was clear in a moment. It was the Mule who had created the despair in the Time Vault; it was Magnifico who had created the despair on Neotrantor. It was the same emotion. Therefore, the Mule and Magnifico were the same person. Doesn't it work out nicely, Torie? Isn't it just like an axiom in geometry……things equal to the same thing are equal to each other?"</p><p>“那时，我第一次想到这个可能。起初只是一个模糊的感觉……或者可以称为直觉。除此之外，我没有进一步的线索。后来，普利吉告诉我们有关骡的历史，以及他的突变异能，我才顿时恍然大悟。在时光穹窿中制造绝望感的是骡，在新川陀制造绝望感的是马巨擘。两种情感完全一样，因此，骡和马巨擘应该是同一个人。杜，这是不是很合理呢？就像几何学的公理……甲等于乙，甲等于丙，则乙就等于丙。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was at the edge of hysteria, but dragged herself back to sobriety by main force. She continued, "The discovery scared me to death. If Magnifico were the Mule, he could know my emotions……and cure them for his own purposes. I dared not let him know. I avoided him. Luckily, he avoided me also; he was too interested in Ebling Mis. I planned killing Mis before he could talk. I planned it secretly……as secretly as I could……so secretly I didn't dare tell it to myself. If I could have killed the Mule himself……But I couldn't take the chance. He would have noticed, and I would have lost everything."</p><p>她已经接近歇斯底里，但仍然勉力维持着冷静。她继续说：“这个发现令我害怕得要死。假如马巨擘就是骡，他就能知道我的情感……然后矫正这些情感，以符合他自己的需要。我不敢让他察觉，所以尽量避开他。还好，他也避着我；他把注意力全部放在艾布林·米斯身上。我早就计划好了，准备在米斯泄露口风之前杀掉他。我秘密计划着……尽可能不露任何痕迹……自己都不敢跟自己讨论。假如我有办法杀死骡……但是我不能冒这个险。他一定会发觉，而我就会一败涂地。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She seemed drained of emotion.</p><p>她的情感似乎要榨干了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran said harshly and with finality, "It's impossible. Look at the miserable creature. He the Mule? He doesn't even hear what we're saying."</p><p>杜伦仍然坚决不同意，他粗声说道：“这绝对不可能。看看那个可怜兮兮的家伙，他怎么会是骡？他甚至没有听到我们在说什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But when his eyes followed his pointing finger, Magnifico was erect and alert, his eyes sharp and darkly bright. His voice was without a trace of an accent, "I hear her, my friend. It is merely that I have been sitting here and brooding on the fact that with all my cleverness and forethought I could make a mistake, and lose so much."</p><p>可是当他的视线循着手指的方向延伸，马巨擘却已经机敏地站起来，眼中透出阴沉而锐利的目光。他不再有一丝古怪的口音：“朋友，我听到她说的话了。只不过我正坐在这里，正在沉思一件事实：聪明睿智又深谋远虑的我，为何犯下这种错误，令我失败得那么惨。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran stumbled backward as if afraid the clown might touch him or that his breath might contaminate him.</p><p>杜伦跌跌撞撞地连退好几步，似乎害怕“小丑”会碰到自己，或者沾染上他所呼出的气息。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Magnifico nodded, and answered the unspoken question. "I am the Mule."</p><p>马巨擘点点头，回答了对方那个无言的问题。“我就是骡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He seemed no longer a grotesque; his pipestem limbs, his beak of a nose lost their humor-compelling qualities. His fear was gone; his bearing was firm.</p><p>他似乎不再是一个丑怪的畸形人，细长的四肢、又尖又长的鼻子看来一点也不可笑了。他的恐惧已荡然无存，现在他的行为举止既坚决又镇定。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was in command of the situation with an ease born of usage.</p><p>他一下子就掌握住状况，显示他对应付这种场面极有经验。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, tolerantly, "Seat yourselves. Go ahead; you might as well sprawl out and make yourselves comfortable. The game's over, and I'd like to tell you a story. It's a weakness of mine……I want people to understand me."</p><p>他以宽大的口吻说：“你们坐下来吧。坐下，爱怎么坐就怎么坐，尽量放轻松。游戏已经结束，我想讲一个故事给你们听。这是我的弱点……我希望别人了解我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And his eyes as he looked at Bayta were still the old, soft sad brown ones of Magnifico, the clown.</p><p>他凝望着贝泰，褐色眼珠透出的仍是那个小丑“马巨擘”充满温柔与伤感的眼神。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There is nothing really to my childhood," he began, plunging bodily into quick, impatient speech, "that I care to remember. Perhaps you can understand that. My meagerness is glandular; my nose I was born with. It was not possible for me to lead a normal childhood. My mother died before she saw me. I do not know my father. I grew up haphazard, wounded and tortured in mind, full of self-pity and hatred of others. I was known then as a queer child. All avoided me; most out of dislike; some out of fear. Queer incidents occurred……Well, never mind! Enough happened to enable Captain Pritcher, in his investigation of my childhood to realize that I was a mutant, which was more than I ever realized until I was in my twenties."</p><p>“我的童年实在不堪回首。”他开始了叙述，迫不及待地说得很快：“这点或许你们能够了解。我的瘦弱是先天的，我的鼻子也是生来如此。所以我不可能有一个正常的童年。我的母亲来不及看我一眼就去世了，而我从来不知道父亲是谁。我的成长过程是自生自灭，心灵遭受数不尽的创伤和折磨，以致充塞着自怜和仇恨。我被视为一个古怪的小孩。大家对我敬而远之，大多是出于嫌恶，少数则是由于害怕。在我身边，常会发生意想不到的怪事……不过，不提这些了！正是由于这些怪事太多，才使得普利吉上尉在调查我的童年时，了解到我是个突变种。这个事实，我直到二十几岁才真正发觉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran and Bayta listened distantly. The wash of his voice broke over them, seated on the ground as they were, unheeded almost. The clown……or the Mule……paced before them with little steps, speaking downward to his own folded arms.</p><p>杜伦与贝泰茫然地听着。每一句话都像一个浪头，两人坐在原地一动不动，几乎没有听进多少。小丑……骡，在两人面前踱着碎步，他面对着自己环抱胸前的双手，继续滔滔不绝地说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The whole notion of my unusual power seems to have broken on me so slowly, in such sluggish steps. Even toward the end, I couldn't believe it. To me, men's minds are dials, with pointers that indicate the prevailing emotion. It is a poor picture, but how else can I explain it? Slowly, I learned that I could reach into those minds and turn the pointer to the spot I wished, that I could nail it there forever. And then it took even longer to realize that others couldn't.</p><p>“对于自己这种不寻常的能力，我似乎是慢慢体会出来的，简直慢得不可思议。即使在我完全了解之后，我还是不敢相信。对我而言，人的心灵就像刻度盘，其上的指针所指示的，就是那个人最主要的情感。这个比喻并不高明，但除此之外，我又要如何解释呢？慢慢地，我发现自己有办法接触到那些心灵，将指针拨到我所希望的位置，并让它永远固定在那里。又过了很久之后，我才了解别人都没有这种本事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But the consciousness of power came, and with it, the desire to make up for the miserable position of my earlier life. Maybe you can understand it. Maybe you can try to understand it. It isn't easy to be a freak……to have a mind and an understanding and be a freak. Laughter and cruelty! To be different! To be an outsider!</p><p>“我体认到自己具有超人的能力，随之而来的念头，便是要用它来补偿我悲惨的早年。也许你们能了解这一点，也许你们能试着去了解。身为畸形人，绝不是一件容易的事……尤其是对于这个事实，我自己完全心知肚明。那些刻毒的嘲笑和言语！与众不同！非我族类！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You've never been through it!"</p><p>“你们从未尝过那种滋味！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Magnifico looked up to the sky and teetered on the balls of his feet and reminisced stonily, "But I eventually did learn, and I decided that the Galaxy and I could take turns. Come, they had???? their innings, and I had been patient about it……for twenty-two years. My turn! It would be up to the rest of you to take it! And the odds would be fair enough for the Galaxy. One of me! Quadrillions of them!"</p><p>他抬头望着天空，又摇摇晃晃地踮起脚尖，面无表情地沉浸在回忆中。“但是我终于学会如何自处，并且决定要将银河踩在脚下。好，银河目前是他们的，我就耐着性子等待……足足二十二年之久。现在该轮到我了！该让你们这些人尝尝那种滋味！不过银河占了绝大的优势……我只有一个！对方却有千兆人！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paused to glance at Bayta swiftly. "But I had a weakness. I was nothing in myself. If I could gain power, it could only be by means of others. Success came to me through middlemen. Always! It was as Pritcher said. Through a pirate, I obtained my first asteroidal base of operations. Through an industrialist I got my first foothold on a planet. Through a variety of others ending with the warlord of Kalgan, I won Kalgan itself and got a navy. After that, it was the Foundation……and you two come into the story.</p><p>他顿了一顿，向贝泰迅速瞄了一眼。“可是我也有弱点，我自己做不了任何事。如果我想攫取权力，就得假借他人之手。必须透过中间人，我才能有所成就。一向如此！正如普利吉所说的，我先利用一个江洋大盗，得到了第一个小行星据点。再通过一个实业家，首度占领一颗行星作为根据地。然后又透过许许多多的人，包括那位卡尔根统领，我攻下了卡尔根，拥有了一支舰队。然后，下一个目标便是基地……这时你们两位出场了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Foundation," he said, softly, "was the most difficult task I had met. To beat it, I would have to win over, break down, or render useless an extraordinary proportion of its ruling class. I could have done it from scratch……but a short cut was possible, and I looked for it. After all, if a strong man can lift five hundred pounds, it does not mean that he is eager to do so continuously. My emotional control is not an easy task, I prefer not to use it, where not fully necessary. So I accepted allies in my first attack upon the Foundation.</p><p>“基地，”他柔声道，“我从未面对过那么艰巨的目标。想要攻下基地，我必须先收服、打垮或中和基地绝大多数的统治阶级。我可以从头做起……但也有捷径可循，于是我决定抄捷径。毕竟，一名大力士若能举起五百磅的重物，并不代表他喜欢永远举着不放。我控制情感的过程并不简单，除非绝对必要，我会尽量避免使用。所以在我对付基地的首波行动中，我希望能找到盟友。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As my clown, I looked for the agent, or agents, of the Foundation that must inevitably have been sent to Kalgan to investigate my humble self. I know now it was Han Pritcher I was looking for. By a stroke of fortune, I found you instead. I am a telepath, but not a complete one, and, my lady, you were from the Foundation. I was led astray by that. It was not fatal for Pritcher joined us afterward, but it was the starting point of an error that was fatal."</p><p>“我化装成小丑，开始寻找基地的间谍。我确定基地派出一至数名的间谍，到卡尔根来调查我的底细。现在我知道，当初我要找的是汉·普利吉。由于意想不到的好运，我却先碰到你们两位。我拥有精神感应力，却没有高段的读心术，而你，我亲爱的女士，你是从基地来的。我误以为你就是我的目标。这并不是严重的错误，因为普利吉后来还是加入我们，却是导致致命错误的第一步。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran stirred for the first time. He spoke in an outraged tone, "Hold on, now. You mean that when I outfaced that lieutenant on Kalgan with only a stun pistol, and rescued you……that you had emotionally-controlled me into it." He was spluttering. "You mean I've been tampered with all along."</p><p>杜伦直到此时才挪动了一下，并用愤怒的语调说：“等一等。你的意思是，当我手中只有一柄麻痹枪，却勇敢地面对那名中尉，奋不顾身拯救你的时候……其实是你控制了我的情感。”他又气急败坏地问道：“你的意思是，从头到尾我都受到你的控制？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A thin smile played on Magnifico's face. "Why not? You don't think it's likely? Ask yourself then……Would you have risked death for a strange grotesque you had never seen before, if you had been in your right mind? I imagine you were surprised at events in cold after-blood."</p><p>骡脸上露出极淡的笑意。“有何不可？你认为不太可能吗？那么问问你自己……假如你的心智正常，有可能为了一个从没见过的丑怪陌生人，而甘冒生命危险吗？我想，当你冷静下来之后，一定曾对自己的行动惊讶不已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said Bayta, distantly, "he was. It's quite plain."</p><p>“没错，”贝泰恍惚地答道，“他的确惊讶。这是很自然的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As it was," continued the Mule, "Toran was in no danger. The lieutenant had his own strict instructions to let us go. So the three of us and Pritcher went to the Foundation……and see how my campaign shaped itself instantly. When Pritcher was court-martialed and we were present, I was busy. The military judges of that trial later commanded their squadrons in the war. They surrendered rather easily, and my Navy won the battle of Horleggor, and other lesser affairs.</p><p>“其实，”骡继续说，“杜伦当初并没有危险。那名中尉早就接到明确的指令，他一定会放我们走的。于是我们三个人，再加上后来的普利吉，便一起到了基地……看看，我的计划进行得多么顺利。普利吉在接受军事审判时，我们三人也在场，当时我忙得很。那个军事法庭的审判官，后来战时担任一支分遣舰队的指挥官。结果他们轻易就投降了，我的舰队因此赢得侯里哥之役，以及其他几场小型战役。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Through Pritcher, I met Dr. Mis, who brought me a Visi-Sonor, entirely of his own accord, and simplified my task immensely. Only it wasn't entirely of his own accord."</p><p>“透过普利吉，我接触到米斯博士。米斯送给我一把声光琴，这完全出于他的自愿，却大大简化了我的工作。只不过，这并非完全出于他的自愿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bayta interrupted, "Those concerts! I've been trying to fit them in. Now I see."</p><p>贝泰突然打岔道：“那些演奏会！我曾经想过其中的关联，现在我明白了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said Magnifico, "the Visi-Sonor acts as a focusing device. In a way, it is a primitive device for emotional control in itself. With it, I can handle people in quantity and single people more intensively. The concerts I gave on Terminus before it fell and Haven before it fell contributed to the general defeatism. I might have made the crown prince of Neotrantor very sick without the Visi-Sonor, but I could not have killed him. You see?</p><p>“没错，”骡说，“声光琴是一种精神聚焦装置，就某方面而言，它就是一种简单的情感控制器。利用声光琴，我能同时影响许多人的情感；如果只对付一个人，效果则会更好。在端点星陷落之前，还有赫汶陷落之前，我在那两个地方所举行的演奏会，都制造了普遍的失败意识。假使没有声光琴，我应该也能让那个皇储受到重创，却不可能要他的命。懂了吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But it was Ebling Mis who was my most important find. He might have been? Magnifico said it with chagrin, then hurried on, "There is a special facet to emotional control you do not know about. Intuition or insight or hunch-tendency, whatever you wish to call it, can be treated as an emotion. At least, I can treat it so. You don't understand it, do you?"</p><p>“但是我最重要的发现，仍然要算艾布林·米斯。他也许能够……”他口气中透着懊恼，赶紧跳到下一句话，“关于情感控制，有一点是你们都不知道的。直觉、预感、洞察力，随便你怎么称呼，反正也能视为一种情感。至少，我能把它当成情感处理。你们并不了解，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He waited for no negative, "The human mind works at low efficiency. Twenty percent is the figure usually given. When, momentarily, there is a flash of greater power it is termed a hunch, or insight, or intuition. I found early that I could induce a continual use of high brain-efficiency. It is a killing process for the person affected, but it is useful. The nuclear field-depressor which I used in the war against the Foundation was the result of high-pressuring a Kalgan technician. Again I work through others.</p><p>他停了一下，并未听到任何否认。“人类心灵的工作效率很低，通常只达到百分之二十。偶尔，会突然迸发较强的精神力量，我们就通称为直觉、预感或洞察力。我很早就发现，我能诱使大脑持续进行高效率的运作。受我影响的人有致命的危险，却能产生建设性的成果……在进攻基地的战争中，我方所使用的核场抑制器，就是一名卡尔根技师在精神高压下研发出来的。照例，我假他人之手为我工作。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ebling Mis was the bull's-eye. His potentialities were high, and I needed him. Even before my war with the Foundation had opened, I had already sent delegates to negotiate with the Empire. It was at that time I began my search for the Second Foundation. Naturally, I didn't find it. Naturally, I knew that I must find it……and Ebling Mis was the answer. With his mind at high efficiency, he might possibly have duplicated the work of Hari Seldon.</p><p>“艾布林·米斯是我最重要的目标。他的潜力极高，而我正需要他这种人。甚至在我对基地开战之前，我已经派出代表跟帝国谈判。从那时候起，我便开始寻找第二基地。当然，我并没有找到。当然，我知道必须把它找出来……而艾布林·米斯正是这个难题的答案。当他的大脑处于高效率状态时，他有可能重新导出哈里·谢顿当年的结果。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Partly, he did. I drove him to the utter limit. The process was ruthless, but had to be completed. He was dying at the end, but he lived? Again, his chagrin interrupted him. "He would have lived long enough. Together, we three could have gone onward to the Second Foundation. It would have been the last battle……but for my mistake."</p><p>“他做到了一部分。我驱使他发挥到极限，这个过程极为残酷，却必须坚持到底。最后他已奄奄一息，却还有一口气……”懊恼的情绪又打断了他的叙述，“他应该能活到把秘密吐出来。然后，我们三人就能一起进军第二基地。那将是最后一场战役……若非我犯了那个错误。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran stirred his voice to hardness, "Why do you stretch it out so? What was your mistake, and……and have done with your speech."</p><p>杜伦以冷酷的声音说：“你为什么要说这么一大堆？你究竟犯了什么错误，和……和你讲的这些又有什么关联？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, your wife was the mistake. Your wife was an unusual person. I had never met her like before in my life. I……I? Quite suddenly, Magnifico's voice broke. He recovered with difficulty. There was a grimness about him as he continued. "She liked me without my having to juggle her emotions. She was neither repelled by me nor amused by me. She liked me!</p><p>“唉，尊夫人正是我的错误。尊夫人与众不同，在我一生中，从来没有遇到像她这样的人。我……我……”骡的声音陡然间变了调，他费了很大力气才恢复过来。当他继续说下去的时候，整个人都显得阴森可怖。“我尚未调拨她的情感，她就开始喜欢我。她既不嫌弃我，也不觉得我滑稽。她就是喜欢我！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't you understand? Can't you see what that would mean to me? Never before had anyone……Well, I……cherished that. My own emotions played me false, though I was master of all others. I stayed out of her mind, you see; I did not tamper with it. I cherished the natural feeling too greatly. It was my mistake……the first.</p><p>“你难道不明白吗？你看不出这对我有多大意义吗？过去从来没有人……唉，我……非常珍惜。虽然我能操控每个人的情感，却被自己的情感愚弄了。我并未碰触她的心灵，你懂了吧；我完全没有影响她。我太过珍惜那份自然的情感。这就是我的错误……首要的错误。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You, Toran, were under control. You never suspected me; never questioned me; never saw anything peculiar or strange about me. As for instance, when the 'Filian' ship stopped us. They knew our location, by the way, because I was in communication with them, as I've remained in communication with my generals at all times. When they stopped us, I was taken aboard to adjust Han Pritcher, who was on it as a prisoner. When I left, he was a colonel, a Mule's man, and in command. The whole procedure was too open even for you, Toran. Yet you accepted my explanation of the matter, which was full of fallacies. See what I mean?"</p><p>“你，杜伦，一直在我控制之下。你从未怀疑我，从未质疑我，也从未发现我有任何特别或奇怪之处。比如说，当那艘‘菲利亚’星舰拦下我们的时候。对了，他们会知道我们的位置，是因为我一直和他们保持联系，正如我一直和将领们保持联系一样。当他们拦下我们的时候，我被带到他们的星舰上，其实是去制约囚禁在那里的汉·普利吉。当我离开的时候，他已经是骡的一名上校，而且成为那艘星舰的指挥官。杜伦，整个过程实在太明显，连你都应该看得出来。你却接受了我所提出的解释，虽然它漏洞百出。明白我的意思吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Toran grimaced, and challenged him, "How did you retain communications with your generals?"?</p><p>杜伦露出痛苦的表情，反问道：“你如何和你的将领们保持联络？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There was no difficulty to it. Hyperwave transmitters are easy to handle and eminently portable. Nor could I be detected in a real sense! Anyone who did catch me in the act would leave me with a slice gapped out of his memory. It happened, on occasion.</p><p>“这不是什么难事。超波发射器操作简便又容易携带。实际上，我也不会被人发现！万一有人撞见我在收发讯号，他的记忆就会被我切掉一小片。这种情况偶尔会发生。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On Neotrantor, my own foolish emotions betrayed me again. Bayta was not under my control, but even so might never have suspected me if I had kept my head about the crown prince. His intentions towards Bayta……annoyed me.</p><p>“在新川陀的时候，我自己的愚蠢情感再度背叛了我。贝泰虽然不在我的控制下，但我若能保持头脑冷静，不去对付那个皇储，她也绝不会开始怀疑我。可是皇储对贝泰不怀好意，这点惹恼了我，所以我杀了他。这是个愚蠢的举动，其实我们只要悄悄逃走即可。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I killed him. It was a foolish gesture. An unobtrusive flight would have served as well."And still your suspicions would not have been certainties, if I had stopped Pritcher in his well-intentioned babbling, or paid less attention to Mis and more to you……"He shrugged.</p><p>“你虽然起疑，但还是不太肯定。而我却一错再错，我不该放任普利吉对你们苦口婆心地喋喋不休，也不该把全副精神放在米斯身上，因而忽略了你……”他耸了耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's the end of it?" asked Bayta.</p><p>“你都说完了吗？”贝泰问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's the end."</p><p>“都说完了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What now, then?"</p><p>“现在，你准备怎么办？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'll continue with my program. That I'll find another as adequately brained and trained as Ebling Mis in these degenerate days, I doubt. I shall have to search for the Second Foundation otherwise. In a sense you have defeated me."</p><p>“我会继续我的计划。我也知道，在如今这个退化的时代，不太可能再找到像艾布林·米斯那样既聪明又受过完整训练的专家。我必须另行设法寻找第二基地。就某个角度而言，你们的确击败了我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now Bayta was upon her feet, triumphant. "In a sense? Only in a sense? We have defeated you entirely! All your victories outside the Foundation count for nothing, since the Galaxy is a barbarian vacuum now. </p><p>现在贝泰也站起来，露出胜利的表情。“就某个角度而言？只是某个角度？我们将你彻底击败了！除了基地，你其他的胜利都微不足道，因为银河系如今是一片蛮荒的虚空。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Foundation itself is only a minor victory, since it wasn't meant to stop your variety of crisis. It's the Second Foundation you must beat……the Second Foundation……and it's the Second Foundation that will defeat you. Your only chance was to locate it and strike it before it was prepared. </p><p>“而攻占基地也只能算小小的胜利，因为对于像你这种意料之外的危机，基地本来就没有胜算。你真正的敌人是第二基地……第、二、基、地……而第二基地一定会击败你。你唯一的机会，是在它准备好之前找到它并消灭它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>You won't do that now. Every minute from now on, they will be readier for you. At this moment, at this moment, the machinery may have started. You'll know……when it strikes you, and your short term of power will be over, and you'll be just another strutting conqueror, flashing quickly and meanly across the bloody face of history."</p><p>“现在你已经做不到了。从现在开始，他们会加紧准备，每分钟都不会浪费。此时此刻，此、时、此、刻，整个机制也许已经启动。当它攻击你的时候，你就会知道了。你短暂的权力即将消失，而你会像其他那些曾经不可一世的征服者一样，在一页血腥的历史上迅速而卑贱地一闪而过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was breathing hard, nearly gasping in her vehemence, "And we've defeated you, Toran and I. I am satisfied to die."</p><p>她大口大口地呼吸，几乎由于太过激动而喘不过气来。“杜伦和我，我们已经击败了你。我如今死也瞑目。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the Mule's sad, brown eyes were the sad, brown, loving eyes of Magnifico. "I won't kill you or your husband. It is, after all, impossible for you two to hurt me further; and killing you won't bring back Ebling Mis. My mistakes were my own, and I take responsibility for them. Your husband and yourself may leave! Go in peace, for the sake of what I call……friendship."</p><p>骡的一双伤感的褐色眼睛，仍是马巨擘那一双伤感又充满爱意的褐色眼睛。“我不会杀你或你的丈夫。毕竟，你们两人不可能再对我造成进一步的伤害；而且杀了你们也不能让艾布林·米斯起死回生。我的错误是咎由自取，我自己承担全部责任。你的丈夫和你自己都可以离开！平安地走吧，就冲着我所谓的……友谊。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then, with a sudden touch of pride, "And meanwhile I am still the Mule, the most powerful man in the Galaxy. I shall still defeat the Second Foundation."</p><p>然后，他突然又露出高傲的神情。“无论如何，我仍旧是骡，是银河系最有权势的人。我依然会击败第二基地。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Bayta shot her last arrow with a firm, calm certitude, "You won't! I have faith in the wisdom of Seldon yet. You shall be the last ruler of your dynasty, as well as the first."</p><p>贝泰不放过对他的最后一击，她以坚定、冷静而信心十足的口吻说：“你休想！我对谢顿的智慧仍充满信心。你是你这个皇朝的开国者，却也是最后一任皇帝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Something caught Magnifico. "Of my dynasty? Yes, I had thought of that, often. That I might establish a dynasty. That I might have a suitable consort."</p><p>骡像是被击中了要害。“我的皇朝？是的，我也想过，常常在想。我应该建立一个皇朝，还应该找一位理想的皇后。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bayta suddenly caught the meaning of the look in his eyes and froze horribly.</p><p>贝泰顿时体会出他眼神中的含意，吓得全身僵凝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Magnifico shook his head. "I sense your revulsion, but that's silly. If things were otherwise, I could make you happy very easily. It would be an artificial ecstasy, but there would be no difference between it and the genuine emotion. But things are not otherwise. I call myself the Mule……but not because of my strength……obviously……"</p><p>骡却摇摇头。“我感应到你心中的厌恶，但那是个傻念头。倘若不是如今这种情况，我轻而易举便能让你感到快乐。那种至高无上的喜悦虽然是人力的结果，却和真实的情感无分轩轾。可惜事实就是如此，我自称为骡……并不是因为我有过人的力量……显然不是……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He left them, never looking back.</p><p>他转身就走，没有回头再看一眼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Isaac Asimov was born in the Soviet union to his great surprise. He moved quickly to correct the situation. When his parents emigrated to the United States, Isaac (three years old at the time) stowed away in their baggage. He has been an American citizen since the age of eight.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Brought up in Brooklyn, and educated in its public schools, he eventually found his way to Columbia University and, over the protests of the school administration, managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry, up to and including a Ph.D. He then infiltrated Boston University and climbed the academic ladder, ignoring all cries of outrage, until he found himself Professor of Biochemistry.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Meanwhile, at the age of nine, he found the love of his life (in the inanimate sense) when he discovered his first science-fiction magazine. By the time he was eleven, he began to write stories, and at eighteen, he actually worked up the nerve to submit one. It was rejected. After four long months of tribulation and suffering, he sold his first story and, thereafter, he never looked back.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In 1941, when he was twenty-one years old, he wrote the classic short story "Nightfall" and his future was assured. Shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories, and shortly after that he had begun his Foundation series.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What was left except quantity? At the present time, he has published over 260 books, distributed through every major division of the Dewey system of library classification, and shows no signs of slowing up. He remains as youthful, as lively, and as lovable as ever, and grows more handsome with each year. You can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He is married to Janet Jeppson, psychiatrist and writer, has two children by a previous marriage, and lives in New York City.?</p><p></p></div>
