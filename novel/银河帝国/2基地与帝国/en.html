24. CONVERT<br />
The thin life of Trantor trickled to nothing when they entered among the wide-spaced buildings of the University grounds. There was a solemn and lonely silence over it.<br />
The strangers of the Foundation knew nothing of the swirling days and nights of the bloody Sack that had left the University untouched. They knew nothing of the time after the collapse of the Imperial power, when the students, with their borrowed weapons, and their pale-faced inexperienced bravery, formed a protective volunteer army to protect the central shrine of the science of the Galaxy. They knew nothing of the Seven Days Fight, and the armistice that kept the University free, when even the Imperial palace clanged with the boots of Gilmer and his soldiers, during the short interval of their rule.<br />
Those of the Foundation, approaching for the first time, realized only that in a world of transition from a gutted old to a strenuous new this area was a quiet, graceful museum-piece of ancient greatness.<br />
They were intruders in a sense. The brooding emptiness rejected them. The academic atmosphere seemed still to live and to stir angrily at the disturbance.<br />
The library was a deceptively small building which broadened out vastly underground into a mammoth volume of silence and reverie. Ebling Mis paused before the elaborate murals of the reception room.<br />
He whispered¡­¡­one had to whisper here: &quot;I think we passed the catalog rooms back a way. I'll stop there.&quot;<br />
His forehead was flushed, his hand trembling, &quot;I mustn't be disturbed, Toran. Will you bring my meals down to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Anything you say. We'll do all we can to help. Do you want us to work under you?<br />
&quot;No. I must be alone?<br />
&quot;You think you will get what you want.&quot;<br />
And Ebling Mis replied with a soft certainty, &quot;I know I will!&quot;<br />
Toran and Bayta came closer to &quot;setting up housekeeping&quot; in normal fashion than at any time in their year of married life. It was a strange sort of &quot;housekeeping.&quot; They lived in the middle of grandeur with an inappropriate simplicity. Their food was drawn largely from Lee Senter's farm and was paid for in the little nuclear gadgets that may be found on any Trader's ship.<br />
Magnifico taught himself how to use the projectors in the library reading room, and sat over adventure novels and romances to the point where he was almost as forgetful of meals and sleep as was Ebling Mis.<br />
Ebling himself was completely buried. He had insisted on a hammock being slung up for him in the Psychology Reference Room. His face grew thin and white. His vigor of speech was lost and his favorite curses had died a mild death. There were times when the recognition of either Toran or Bayta seemed a struggle.<br />
He was more himself with Magnifico who brought him his meals and often sat watching him for hours at a time, with a queer, fascinated absorption, as the aging psychologist transcribed endless equations, cross-referred to endless book-films, scurried endlessly about in a wild mental effort towards an end he alone saw.<br />
Toran came upon her in the darkened room, and said sharply, &quot;Bayta!&quot;<br />
Bayta started guiltily. &quot;Yes? You want me, Torie?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure I want you. What in Space are you sitting there for? You've been acting all wrong since we got to Trantor. What's the matter with you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, Torie, stop,&quot; she said, wearily.<br />
And &quot;Oh, Torie, stop!&quot; he mimicked impatiently. Then, with sudden softness, &quot;Won't you tell me what's wrong, Bay? Something's bothering you.&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Nothing is, Torie. If you keep on just nagging and nagging, you'll have me mad. I'm just¡­¡­thinking.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thinking about what?&quot;<br />
&quot;About nothing. Well, about the Mule, and Haven, and the Foundation, and everything. About Ebling Mis and whether he'll find anything about the Second Foundation, and whether it will help us when he does find it¡­¡­and a million other things. Are you satisfied?&quot; Her voice was agitated.<br />
&quot;If you're just brooding, do you mind stopping? It isn't pleasant and it doesn't help the situation.&quot;<br />
Bayta got to her feet and smiled weakly. &quot;All right. I'm happy. See, I'm smiling and jolly. &quot;<br />
Magnifico's voice was an agitated cry outside. &quot;My lady?<br />
&quot;What is it? Come?<br />
Bayta's voice choked off sharply when the opening door framed the large, hard-faced?<br />
&quot;Pritcher,&quot; cried Toran.<br />
Bayta gasped, &quot;Captain! How did you find us?&quot;<br />
Han Pritcher stepped inside. His voice was clear and level, and utterly dead of feeling, &quot;My rank is colonel now¡­¡­under the Mule.&quot;<br />
&quot;Under the ... Mule!&quot; Toran's voice trailed off. They formed a tableau there, the three.<br />
Magnifico stared wildly and shrank behind Toran. Nobody stopped to notice him.<br />
Bayta said, her hands trembling in each other's tight grasp, &quot;You are arresting us? You have really gone over to them?&quot;<br />
The colonel replied quickly, &quot;I have not come to arrest you. My instructions make no mention of you. With regard to you, I am free, and I choose to exercise our old friendship, if you will let me.&quot;<br />
Toran's face was a twisted suppression of fury, &quot;How did you find us? You were in the Filian ship, then? You followed us?&quot;<br />
The wooden lack of expression on Pritcher's face might have flickered in embarrassment. &quot;I was on the Filian ship! I met you in the first place ... well ... by chance.&quot;<br />
&quot;It is a chance that is mathematically impossible.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Simply rather improbable, so my statement will have to stand. In any case, you admitted to the. Filians¡­¡­there is, of course, no such nation as Filia actually¡­¡­that you were heading for the Trantor sector, and since the Mule already had his contacts upon Neotrantor, it was easy to have you detained there. Unfortunately, you got away before I arrived, but not long before. I had time to have the farms on Trantor ordered to report your arrival. It was done and I am here. May I sit down? I come in friendliness, believe me.<br />
He sat. Toran bent his head and thought futilely. With a numbed lack of emotion, Bayta prepared tea.<br />
Toran looked up harshly. &quot;Well, what are you waiting for¡­¡­colonel? What's your friendship? If it's not arrest, what is it then? Protective custody? Call in your men and give your orders.&quot;<br />
Patiently, Pritcher shook his head. &quot;No, Toran. I come of my own will to speak to you, to persuade you of the uselessness of what you are doing. If I fail I shall leave. That is all.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is all? Well, then peddle your propaganda, give us your speech, and leave. I don't want any tea, Bayta.&quot;<br />
Pritcher accepted a cup, with a grave word of thanks. He looked at Toran with a clear strength as he sipped lightly. Then he said, &quot;The Mule is a mutant. He can not be beaten in the very nature of the mutation?<br />
&quot;Why? What is the mutation?&quot; asked Toran, with sour humor. &quot;I suppose you'll tell us now, eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I will. Your knowledge won't hurt him. You see¡­¡­he is capable of adjusting the emotional balance of human beings. It sounds like a little trick, but it's quite unbeatable.&quot;<br />
Bayta broke in, &quot;The emotional balance?&quot; She frowned, &quot;Won't you explain that? I don't quite understand.&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean that it is an easy matter for him to instill into a capable general, say, the emotion of utter loyalty to the Mule and complete belief in the Mule's victory. His generals are emotionally controlled. They can not betray him; they can not weaken¡­¡­and the control is permanent. His most capable enemies become his most faithful subordinates, The warlord of Kalgan surrenders his planet and becomes his viceroy for the Foundation.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you,&quot; added Bayta, bitterly, &quot;betray your cause and become Mule's envoy to Trantor. I see!&quot;<br />
&quot;I haven't finished. The Mule's gift works in reverse even more effectively. Despair is an emotion! At the crucial moment, keymen on the Foundation¡­¡­keymen on Haven¡­¡­despaired. Their worlds fell without too much struggle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you mean to say,&quot; demanded Bayta, tensely, &quot;that the feeling I had in the Time Vault was the Mule juggling my emotional control.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mine, too. Everyone's. How was it on Haven towards the end?&quot;<br />
Bayta turned away.<br />
Colonel Pritcher continued earnestly, &quot;As it works for worlds, so it works for individuals. Can you fight a force which can make you surrender willingly when it so desires; can make you a faithful servant when it so desires?&quot;<br />
Toran said slowly, &quot;How do I know this is the truth?&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you explain the fall of the Foundation and of Haven otherwise? Can you explain my conversion otherwise? Think, man! What have you¡­¡­or I¡­¡­or the whole Galaxy accomplished against the Mule in all this time? What one little thing?&quot;<br />
Toran felt the challenge, &quot;By the Galaxy, I can!&quot; With a sudden touch of fierce satisfaction, he shouted, &quot;Your wonderful Mule had contacts with Neotrantor you say that were to have detained us, eh? Those contacts are dead or worse. We killed the crown prince and left the other a whimpering idiot. The Mule did not stop us there, and that much has been undone.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why, no, not at all. Those weren't our men. The crown prince was a wine-soaked mediocrity. The other man, Commason, is phenomenally stupid. He was a power on his world but that didn't prevent him from being vicious, evil, and completely incompetent. We had nothing really to do with them. They were, in a sense, merely feints?<br />
&quot;It was they who detained us, or tried.&quot;<br />
&quot;Again, no. Commason had a personal slave¡­¡­a man called Inchney. Detention was his policy. He is old, but will serve our temporary purpose. You would not have killed him, you see.&quot;<br />
Bayta whirled on him. She had not touched her own tea. &quot;But, by your very statement, your own emotions have been tampered with. You've got faith and belief in the Mule, an unnatural, a diseased faith in the Mule. Of what value are your opinions? You've lost all power of objective thought.&quot;<br />
&quot;You are wrong.&quot; Slowly, the colonel shook his head. &quot;Only my emotions are fixed. My reason is as it always was. It may be influenced in a certain direction by my conditioned emotions, but it is not forced. And there are some things I can see more clearly now that I am freed of my earlier emotional trend.<br />
&quot;I can see that the Mule's program is an intelligent and worthy one. In the time since I have been¡­¡­converted, I have followed his career from its start seven years ago. With his mutant mental power, he began by winning over a condottiere and his band. With that¡­¡­and his power¡­¡­he won a planet. With that¡­¡­and his power¡­¡­he extended his grip until he could tackle the warlord of Kalgan. Each step followed the other logically. With Kalgan in his pocket, he had a first-class fleet, and with that¡­¡­and his power¡­¡­he could attack the Foundation.<br />
&quot;The Foundation is the key. It is the greatest area of industrial concentration in the Galaxy, and now that the nuclear techniques of the Foundation are in his hands, he is the actual master of the Galaxy. With those techniques¡­¡­and his power¡­¡­he can force the remnants of the Empire to acknowledge his rule, and eventually¡­¡­with the death of the old emperor, who is mad and not long for this world¡­¡­to crown him emperor. He will then have the name as well as the fact. With that¡­¡­and his power¡­¡­where is the world in the Galaxy that can oppose him?<br />
&quot;In these last seven years, he has established a new Empire. In seven years, in other words, he will have accomplished what all Seldon's psychohistory could not have done in less than aaaadditional seven hundred. The Galaxy will have peace and order at last.<br />
&quot;And you could not stop it¡­¡­any more than you could stop a planet's rush with your shoulders.&quot;<br />
A long silence followed Pritcher's speech. What remained of his tea had grown cold. He emptied his cup, filled it again, and drained it slowly. Toran bit viciously at a thumbnail. Bayta's face was cold, and distant, and white.<br />
Then Bayta said in a thin voice, &quot;We are not convinced. If the Mule wishes us to be, let him come here and condition us himself. You fought him until the last moment of your conversion, I imagine, didn't you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; said Colonel Pritcher, solemnly.<br />
&quot;Then allow us the same privilege.&quot;<br />
Colonel Pritcher arose. With a crisp air of finality, he said, &quot;Then I leave. As I said earlier, my mission at present concerns you in no way. Therefore, I don't think it will be necessary to report your presence here. That is not too great a kindness. If the Mule wishes you stopped, he no doubt has other men assigned to the job, and you will be stopped. But, for what it is worth, I shall not contribute more than my requirement.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Bayta faintly.<br />
&quot;As for Magnifico. Where is he? Come out, Magnifico, I won't hurt you?<br />
&quot;What about him?&quot; demanded Bayta, with sudden animation.<br />
&quot;Nothing. My instructions make no mention of him, either. I have heard that he is searched for, but the Mule will find him when the time suits him. I shall say nothing. Will you shake hands?&quot;<br />
Bayta shook her head. Toran glared his frustrated contempt.<br />
There was the slightest lowering of the colonel's iron shoulders. He strode to the door, turned and said:<br />
&quot;One last thing. Don't think I am not aware of the source of your stubbornness. It is known that you search for the Second Foundation. The Mule, in his time, will take his measures. Nothing will help you¡­¡­But I knew you in other times; perhaps there is something in my conscience that urged me to this; at any rate, I tried to help you and remove you from the final danger before it was too late. Good-by.&quot;<br />
He saluted sharply¡­¡­and was gone.<br />
Bayta turned to a silent Toran, and whispered, &quot;They even know about the Second Foundation.&quot;<br />
In the recesses of the library, Ebling Mis, unaware of all, crouched under the one spark of light amid the murky spaces and mumbled triumphantly to himself.<br />
25. DEATH OF A PSYCHOLOGIST<br />
After that there were only two weeks left to the life of Ebling Mis.<br />
And in those two weeks, Bayta was with him three times. The first time was on the night after the evening upon which they saw Colonel Pritcher. The second was one week later. And the third was again a week later¡­¡­on the last day¡­¡­the day Mis died.<br />
First, there was the night of Colonel Pritcher's evening, the first hour of which was spent by a stricken pair in a brooding, unmerry merry-go-round.<br />
Bayta said, &quot;Torie, let's tell Ebling.&quot;<br />
Toran said dully, &quot;Think he can help?&quot;<br />
&quot;We're only two. We've got to take some of the weight off. Maybe he can help.&quot;<br />
Toran said, &quot;He's changed. He's lost weight. He's a little feathery; a little woolly.&quot; His fingers groped in air, metaphorically. &quot;Sometimes, I don't think he'll help us muchever. Sometimes, I don't think anything will help.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't!&quot; Bayta's voice caught and escaped a break, &quot;Torie, don't! When you say that, I think the Mule's getting us. Let's tell Ebling, Torie¡­¡­now!&quot;<br />
Ebling Mis raised his head from the long desk, and bleared at them as they approached. His thinning hair was scuffed up, his lips made sleepy, smacking sounds.<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; he said. &quot;Someone want me?&quot;<br />
Bayta bent to her knees, &quot;Did we wake you? Shall we leave?&quot;<br />
&quot;Leave? Who is it? Bayta? No, no, stay! Aren't there chairs? I saw them? His finger pointed vaguely.<br />
Toran pushed two ahead of him. Bayta sat down and took one of the psychologist's flaccid hands in hers. &quot;May we talk to you, Doctor?&quot; She rarely used the title.<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; A little sparkle returned to his abstracted eyes. His sagging cheeks regained a touch of color. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
Bayta said, &quot;Captain Pritcher has been here. Let me talk, Torie. You remember Captain Pritcher, Doctor?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes?Yes? His fingers pinched his lips and released them. &quot;Tall man. Democrat.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, he. He's discovered the Mule's mutation. He was here, Doctor, and told us.&quot;<br />
&quot;But that is nothing new. The Mule's mutation is straightened out.&quot; In honest astonishment, &quot;Haven't I told you? Have I forgotten to tell you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Forgotten to tell us what?&quot; put in Toran, quickly.<br />
&quot;About the Mule's mutation, of course. He tampers with emotions. Emotional control! I haven't told you? Now what made me forget?&quot; Slowly, he sucked in his under lip and considered.<br />
Then, slowly, life crept into his voice and his eyelids lifted wide, as though his sluggish brain had slid onto a well-greased single track. He spoke in a dream, looking between the two listeners rather than at them. &quot;It is really so simple. It requires no specialized knowledge. In the mathematics of psychohistory, of course, it works out promptly, in a third-level equation involving no more¡­¡­Never mind that. It can be put into ordinary words¡­¡­roughly¡­¡­and have it make sense, which isn't usual with psychohistorical phenomena.<br />
&quot;Ask yourselves¡­¡­What can upset Hari Seldon's careful scheme of history, eh?&quot; He peered from one to the other with a mild, questioning anxiety. &quot;What were Seldon's original assumptions? First, that there would be no fundamental change in human society over the next thousand years.<br />
&quot;For instance, suppose there were a major change in the Galaxy's technology, such as finding a new principle for the utilization of energy, or perfecting the study of electronic neurobiology. Social changes would render Seldon's original equations obsolete. But that hasn't happened, has it now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Or suppose that a new weapon were to be invented by forces outside the Foundation, capable of withstanding all the Foundation's armaments. That might cause a ruinous deviation, though less certainly. But even that hasn't happened. The Mule's Nuclear Field-Depressor was a clumsy weapon and could be countered. And that was the only novelty he presented, poor as it was.<br />
&quot;But there was a second assumption, a more subtle one! Seldon assumed that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant. Granted that the first assumption held true, then the second must have broken down! Some factor must be twisting and distorting the emotional responses of human beings or Seldon couldn't have failed and the Foundation couldn't have fallen. And what factor but the Mule?<br />
&quot;Am I right? Is there a flaw in the reasoning?&quot;<br />
Bayta's plump hand patted his gently. &quot;No flaw, Ebling.&quot;<br />
Mis was joyful, like a child. &quot;This and more comes so easily. I tell you I wonder sometimes what is going on inside me. I seem to recall the time when so much was a mystery to me and now things are so clear. Problems are absent. I come across what might be one, and somehow, inside me, I see and understand. And my guesses, my theories seem always to be borne out. There's a drive in me ... always onward ... so that I can't stop ... and I don't want to eat or sleep ... but always go on ... and on ... and on?<br />
His voice was a whisper; his wasted, blue-veined hand rested tremblingly upon his forehead. There was a frenzy in his eyes that faded and went out.<br />
He said more quietly, &quot;Then I never told you about the Mule's mutant powers, did I? But then ... did you say you knew about it?&quot;<br />
&quot;It was Captain Pritcher, Ebling,&quot; said Bayta. &quot;Remember?&quot;<br />
&quot;He told you?&quot; There was a tinge of outrage in his tone. &quot;But how did he find out?&quot;<br />
&quot;He's been conditioned by the Mule. He's a colonel now, a Mule's man. He came to advise us to surrender to the Mule, and he told us¡­¡­what you told us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then the Mule knows we're here? I must hurry¡­¡­Where's Magnifico? Isn't he with you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Magnifico's sleeping,&quot; said Toran, impatiently. &quot;It's past midnight, you know.&quot;<br />
&quot;It is? Then¡­¡­Was I sleeping when you came in?&quot;<br />
&quot;You were,&quot; said Bayta decisively, &quot;and you're not going back to work, either. You're getting into bed. Come on, Torie, help me. And you stop pushing at me, Ebling, because it's just your luck I don't shove you under a shower first. Pull off his shoes, Torie, and tomorrow you come down here and drag him out into the open air before he fades completely away. Look at you, Ebling, you'll be growing cobwebs. Are you hungry?&quot;<br />
Ebling Mis shook his head and looked up from his cot in a peevish confusion. &quot;I want you to send Magnifico down tomorrow,&quot; he muttered.<br />
Bayta tucked the sheet around his neck. &quot;You'll have me down tomorrow, with washed clothes. You're going to take a good bath, and then get out and visit the farm and feel a little sun on you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I won't do it,&quot; said Mis weakly. &quot;You hear me? I'm too busy.&quot;<br />
His sparse hair spread out on the pillow like a silver fringe about his head. His voice was a confidential whisper. &quot;You want that Second Foundation, don't you?&quot;<br />
Toran turned quickly and squatted down on the cot beside him. &quot;What about the Second Foundation, Ebling?&quot;<br />
The psychologist freed an arm from beneath the sheet and his tired fingers clutched at Toran's sleeve. &quot;The Foundations were established at a great Psychological Convention presided over by Hari Seldon. Toran, I have located the published minutes of that Convention. Twenty-five fat films. I have already looked through various summaries.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, do you know that it is very easy to find from them the exact location of the First Foundation, if you know anything at all about psychohistory. It is frequently referred to, when you understand the equations. But Toran, nobody mentions the Second Foundation, There has been no reference to it anywhere.&quot;<br />
Toran's eyebrows pulled into a frown. &quot;It doesn't exist?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course it exists,&quot; cried Mis, angrily, &quot;who said it didn't? But there's less talk of it. Its significance¡­¡­and all about it¡­¡­are better hidden, better obscured. Don't you see? It's the more important of the two. It's the critical one; the one that counts! And I've got the minutes of the Seldon Convention. The Mule hasn't won yet?<br />
Quietly, Bayta turned the lights down. &quot;Go to sleep!&quot;<br />
Without speaking, Toran and Bayta made their way up to their own quarters.<br />
The next day, Ebling Mis bathed and dressed himself, saw the sun of Trantor and felt the wind of Trantor for the last time. At the end of the day he was once again submerged in the gigantic recesses of the library, and never emerged thereafter.<br />
In the week that followed, life settled again into its groove. The sun of Neotrantor was a calm, bright star in Trantor's night sky. The farm was busy with its spring planting. The University grounds were silent in their desertion. The Galaxy seemed empty. The Mule might never have existed.<br />
Bayta was thinking that as she watched Toran light his cigar carefully and look up at the sections of blue sky visible between the swarming metal spires that encircled the horizon.<br />
&quot;It's a nice day,&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Yes, it is. Have you everything mentioned on the list, Torie?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. Half pound butter, dozen eggs, string beans¡­¡­Got it all down here, Bay. I'll have it right.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. And make sure the vegetables are of the last harvest and not museum relics. Did you see Magnifico anywhere, by the way?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not since breakfast. Guess he's down with Ebling, watching a book-film.&quot;<br />
&quot;All right. Don't waste any time, because I'll need the eggs for dinner.&quot;<br />
Toran left with a backward smile and a wave of the hand.<br />
Bayta turned away as Toran slid out of sight among the maze of metal. She hesitated before the kitchen door, about-faced slowly, and entered the colonnade leading to the elevator that burrowed down into the recesses.<br />
Ebling Mis was there, head bent down over the eyepieces of the projector, motionless, a frozen, questing body. Near him sat Magnifico, screwed up into a chair, eyes sharp and watching¡­¡­a bundle of slatty limbs with a nose emphasizing his scrawny face.<br />
Bayta said softly, &quot;Magnifico?<br />
Magnifico scrambled to his feet. His voice was an eager whisper. &quot;My lady!&quot;<br />
&quot;Magnifico,&quot; said Bayta, &quot;Toran has left for the farm and won't be back for a while. Would you be a good boy and go out after him with a message that I'll write for you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Gladly, my lady. My small services are but too eagerly yours, for the tiny uses you can put them to.&quot;<br />
She was alone with Ebling Mis, who had not moved. Firmly, she placed her hand upon his shoulder. &quot;Ebling?<br />
The psychologist started, with a peevish cry, &quot;What is it?&quot; He wrinkled his eyes. &quot;Is it you, Bayta? Where's Magnifico?&quot;<br />
&quot;I sent him away. I want to be alone with you for a while.&quot; She enunciated her words with exaggerated distinctness. &quot;I want to talk to you, Ebling.&quot;<br />
The psychologist made a move to return to his projector, but her hand on his shoulder was firm. She felt the bone under the sleeve clearly. The flesh seemed to have fairly melted away since their arrival on Trantor. His face was thin, yellowish, and bore a half-week stubble. His shoulders were visibly stooped, even in a sitting position.<br />
Bayta said, &quot;Magnifico isn't bothering you, is he, Ebling? He seems to be down here night and day.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, no, no! Not at all. Why, I don't mind him. He is silent and never disturbs me. Sometimes he carries the films back and forth for me; seems to know what I want without my speaking. Just let him be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very well¡­¡­but, Ebling, doesn't he make you wonder? Do you hear me, Ebling? Doesn't he make you wonder?&quot;<br />
She jerked a chair close to his and stared at him as though to pull the answer out of his eyes.<br />
Ebling Mis shook his head. &quot;No. What do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean that Colonel Pritcher and you both say the Mule can condition the emotions of human beings. But are you sure of it? Isn't Magnifico himself a flaw in the theory?&quot;<br />
There was silence.<br />
Bayta repressed a strong desire to shake the psychologist. &quot;What's wrong with you, Ebling? Magnifico was the Mule's clown. Why wasn't he conditioned to love and faith? Why should he, of all those in contact with the Mule, hate him so.<br />
&quot;But ... but he was conditioned. Certainly, Bay!&quot; He seemed to gather certainty as he spoke. &quot;Do you suppose that the Mule treats his clown the way he treats his generals? He needs faith and loyalty in the latter, but in his clown he needs only fear. Didn't you ever notice that Magnifico's continual state of panic is pathological in nature? Do you suppose it is natural for a human being to be as frightened as that all the time? Fear to such an extent becomes comic. It was probably comic to the Mule¡­¡­and helpful, too, since it obscured what help we might have gotten earlier from Magnifico.&quot;<br />
Bayta said, &quot;You mean Magnifico's information about the Mule was false?&quot;<br />
&quot;it was misleading. It was colored by pathological fear. The Mule is not the physical giant Magnifico thinks. He is more probably an ordinary man outside his mental powers. But if it amused him to appear a superman to poor Magnifico? The psychologist shrugged. &quot;In any case, Magnifico's information is no longer of importance.&quot;<br />
&quot;What is, then?&quot;<br />
But Mis shook himself loose and returned to his projector.<br />
&quot;What is, then?&quot; she repeated. &quot;The Second Foundation?&quot;<br />
The psychologist's eyes jerked towards her. &quot;Have I told you anything about that? I don't remember telling you anything. I'm not ready yet. What have I told you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Bayta, intensely. &quot;Oh, Galaxy, you've told me nothing, but I wish you would because I'm deathly tired. When will it be over?&quot;<br />
Ebling Mis peered at her, vaguely rueful, &quot;Well, now, my ... my dear, I did not mean to hurt you. I forget sometimes ... who my friends are. Sometimes it seems to me that I must not talk of all this. There's a need for secrecy¡­¡­but from the Mule, not from you, my dear.&quot; He patted her shoulder with a weak amiability.<br />
She said, &quot;What about the Second Foundation?&quot;<br />
His voice was automatically a whisper, thin and sibilant. &quot;Do you know the thoroughness with which Seldon covered his traces? The proceedings of the Seldon Convention would have been of no use to me at a as little as a month ago, before this strange insight came. Even now, it seems¡­¡­tenuous. The papers put out by the Convention are often apparently unrelated; always obscure. More than once I wondered if the members of the Convention, themselves, knew all that was in Seldon's mind. Sometimes I think he used the Convention only as a gigantic front, and single-handed erected the structure?<br />
&quot;Of the Foundations?&quot; urged Bayta.<br />
&quot;Of the Second Foundation! Our Foundation was simple. But the Second Foundation was only a name. It was mentioned, but if there was any elaboration, it was hidden deep in the mathematics. There is still much I don't even begin to understand, but for seven days, the bits have been clumping together into a vague picture.<br />
&quot;Foundation Number One was a world of physical scientists. It represented a concentration of the dying science of the Galaxy under the conditions necessary to make it live again. No psychologists were included. It was a peculiar distortion, and must have had a purpose. The usual explanation was that Seldon's psychohistory worked best where the individual working units¡­¡­human beings¡­¡­had no knowledge of what was coming, and could therefore react naturally to all situations. Do you follow me, my dear?<br />
&quot;Yes, doctor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then listen carefully. Foundation Number Two was a world of mental scientists. It was the mirror image of our world. Psychology, not physics, was king.&quot; Triumphantly. &quot;You see?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't.&quot;<br />
&quot;But think, Bayta, use your head. Hari Seldon knew that his psychohistory could predict only probabilities, and not certainties. There was always a margin of error, and as time passed that margin increases in geometric progression. Seldon would naturally guard as well as he could against it. Our Foundation was scientifically vigorous. It could conquer armies and weapons. It could pit force against force. But what of the mental attack of a mutant such as the Mule?&quot;<br />
&quot;That would be for the psychologists of the Second Foundation!&quot; Bayta felt excitement rising within her.<br />
&quot;Yes, yeeeeeee! Certainly!&quot;<br />
&quot;But they have done nothing so far.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know they haven't?&quot;<br />
Bayta considered that, &quot;I don't. Do you have evidence that they have?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. There are many factors I know nothing of. The Second Foundation could not have been established full-grown, any more than we were. We developed slowly and grew in strength; they must have also. The stars know at what stage their strength is now. Are they strong enough to fight the Mule? Are they aware of the danger in the first place? Have they capable leaders?&quot;<br />
&quot;But if they follow Seldon's plan, then the Mule must be beaten by the Second Foundation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; and Ebling Mis's thin face wrinkled thoughtfully, &quot;is it that again? But the Second Foundation was a more difficult job than the First. Its complexity is hugely greater; and consequently so is its possibility of error. And if the Second Foundation should not beat the Mule, it is bad¡­¡­ultimately bad. It is the end, may be, of the human race as we know it.&quot;<br />
&quot;No.<br />
&quot;Yes. If the Mule's descendants inherit his mental powers¡­¡­You see? Homo sapiens could not compete. There would be a new dominant race¡­¡­a new aristocracy¡­¡­with homo sapiens demoted to slave labor as an inferior race. Isn't that so?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, that is so.&quot;<br />
&quot;And even if by some chance the Mule did not establish a dynasty, he would still establish a distorted new Empire upheld by his personal power only. It would die with his death; the Galaxy would be left where it was before he came, except that there would no longer be Foundations around which a real and healthy Second Empire could coalesce. It would mean thousands of years of barbarism. It would mean no end in sight.&quot;<br />
&quot;What can we do? Can we warn the Second Foundation?&quot;<br />
&quot;We must, or they may go under through ignorance, which we can not risk. But there is no way of warning them.&quot;<br />
&quot;No way?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know where they are located. They are 'at the other end of the Galaxy' but that is all, and there are millions of worlds to choose from.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, Ebling, don't they say?&quot; She pointed vaguely at the films that covered the table.<br />
&quot;No, they don't. Not where I can find it¡­¡­yet. The secrecy must mean something. There must be a reason? A puzzled expression returned to his eyes. &quot;But I wish you'd leave. I have wasted enough time, and it's growing short¡­¡­it's growing short.&quot;<br />
He tore away, petulant and frowning.<br />
Magnifico's soft step approached. &quot;Your husband is home, my lady.&quot;<br />
Ebling Mis did not greet the clown. He was back at his projector.<br />
That evening Toran, having listened, spoke, &quot;And you think he's really right, Bay? You think he isn't? He hesitated.<br />
&quot;He is right, Torie. He's sick, I know that. The change that's come over him, the loss in weight, the way he speaks¡­¡­he's sick. But as soon as the subject of the Mule or the Second Foundation, or anything he is working on, comes up, listen to him. He is lucid and clear as the sky of outer space. He knows what he's talking about. I believe him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then there's hope.&quot; It was half a question.<br />
&quot;I ... I haven't worked it out. Maybe! Maybe not! I'm carrying a blaster from now on.&quot; The shiny-barreled weapon was in her hand as she spoke. &quot;Just in case, Torie, just in case.&quot;<br />
&quot;In case what?&quot;<br />
Bayta laughed with a touch of hysteria, &quot;Never mind. Maybe I'm a little crazy, too¡­¡­like Ebling Mis.&quot;<br />
Ebling Mis at that time had seven days to live, and the seven days slipped by, one after the other, quietly.<br />
To Toran, there was a quality of stupor about them. The warming days and the dull silence covered him with lethargy. All life seemed to have lost its quality of action, and changed into an infinite sea of hibernation.<br />
Mis was a hidden entity whose burrowing work produced nothing and did not make itself known. He had barricaded himself. Neither Toran nor Bayta could see him. Only Magnifico's go-between characteristics were evidence of his existence. Magnifico, grown silent and thoughtful, with his tiptoed trays of food and his still, watchful witness in the gloom.<br />
Bayta was more and more a creature of herself. The vivacity died, the self-assured competence wavered. She, too, sought her own worried, absorbed company, and once Toran bad come upon her, fingering her blaster. She had put it away quickly, forced a smile.<br />
&quot;What are you doing with it, Bay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Holding it. Is that a crime?&quot;<br />
&quot;You'll blow your fool head off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then I'll blow it off. Small loss!&quot;<br />
Married life had taught Toran the futility of arguing with a female in a dark-brown mood. He shrugged, and left her.<br />
On the last day, Magnifico scampered breathless into their presence. He clutched at them, frightened. &quot;The learned doctor calls for you. He is not well.&quot;<br />
And he wasn't well. He was in bed, his eyes unnaturally large, unnaturally bright. He was dirty, unrecognizable.<br />
&quot;Ebling!&quot; cried Bayta.<br />
&quot;Let me speak,&quot; croaked the psychologist, lifting his weight to a thin elbow with an effort. &quot;Let me speak. I am finished; the work I pass on to you. I have kept no notes; the scrap-figures I have destroyed. No other must know. All must remain in your minds.&quot;<br />
&quot;Magnifico,&quot; said Bayta, with rough directness. &quot;Go upstairs!&quot;<br />
Reluctantly, the clown rose and took a backward step. His sad eyes were on Mis.<br />
Mis gestured weakly, &quot;He won't matter; let him stay. Stay, Magnifico.&quot;<br />
The clown sat down quickly. Bayta gazed at the floor.<br />
Slowly, slowly, her lower lip caught in her teeth.<br />
Mis said, in a hoarse whisper, &quot;I am convinced the Second Foundation can win, if it is not caught prematurely by the Mule. It has kept itself secret; the secrecy must be upheld; it has a purpose. You must go there; your information is vital ... may make all the difference. Do you hear me?&quot;<br />
Toran cried in near-agony, &quot;Yes, yes! Tell us how to get there, Ebling? Where is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can tell you,&quot; said the faint voice.<br />
He never did.<br />
Bayta, face frozen white, lifted her blaster and shot, with an echoing clap of noise. From the waist upward, Mis was not, and a ragged hole was in the wall behind. From numb fingers, Bayta's blaster dropped to the floor.<br />
26. END OF THE SEARCH<br />
There was not a word to be said. The echoes of the blast rolled away into the outer rooms and rumbled downward into a hoarse, dying whisper. Before its death, it had muffled the sharp clamor of Bayta's falling blaster, smothered Magnifico's high-pitched cry, drowned out Toran's inarticulate roar.<br />
There was a silence of agony.<br />
Bayta's head was bent into obscurity. A droplet caught the light as it fell. Bayta had never wept since her childhood.<br />
Toran's muscles almost cracked in their spasm, but he did not relax¡­¡­he felt as if he would never unclench his teeth again. Magnifico's face was a faded, lifeless mask.<br />
Finally, from between teeth still tight, Toran choked out in an unrecognizable voice, &quot;You're a Mule's woman, then. He got to you!&quot;<br />
Bayta looked up, and her mouth twisted with a painful merriment, &quot;I, a Mule's woman? That's ironic.&quot;<br />
She smiled¡­¡­a brittle effort¡­¡­and tossed her hair back. Slowly, her voice verged back to the normal, or something near it. &quot;It's over, Toran; I can talk now. How much I will survive, I don't know. But I can start talking?<br />
Toran's tension had broken of its own weight and faded into a flaccid dullness, &quot;Talk about what, Bay? What's there to talk about?&quot;<br />
&quot;About the calamity that's followed us. We've remarked about it before, Torie. Don't you remember? How defeat has always bitten at our heels and never actually managed to nip us? We were on the Foundation, and it collapsed while the Independent Traders still fought¡­¡­but we got out in time to go to Haven. We were on Haven, and it collapsed while the others still fought¡­¡­and again we got out in time. We went to Neotrantor, and by now it's undoubtedly joined the Mule.&quot;<br />
Toran listened and shook his head, &quot;I don't understand.&quot;<br />
&quot;Torie, such things don't happen in real life. You and I are insignificant people; we don't fall from one vortex of politics into another continuously for the space of a year¡­¡­unless we carry the vortex with us. Unless we carry the source of infection with us! Now do you see?&quot;<br />
Toran's lips tightened. His glance fixed horribly upon the bloody remnants of what had once been a human, and his eyes sickened.<br />
&quot;Let's get out of here, Bay. Let's get out into the open.&quot;<br />
It was cloudy outside. The wind scudded about them in drab spurts and disordered Bayta's hair. Magnifico had crept after them and now he hovered at the edge of their conversation.<br />
Toran said tightly, &quot;You killed Ebling Mis because you believed him to be the focus of infection?&quot; Something in her eyes struck him. He whispered, &quot;He was the Mule?&quot; He did not¡­¡­could not¡­¡­believe the implications of his own words.<br />
Bayta laughed sharply, &quot;Poor Ebling the Mule? Galaxy, no! I couldn't have killed him if he were the Mule. He would have detected the emotion accompanying the move and changed it for me to love, devotion, adoration, terror, whatever he pleased. No, I killed Ebling because he was not the Mule. I killed him because he knew where the Second Foundation was, and in two seconds would have told the Mule the secret.&quot;<br />
&quot;Would have told the Mule the secret,&quot; Toran repeated stupidly. &quot;Told the Mule?<br />
And then he emitted a sharp cry, and turned to stare in horror at the clown, who might have been crouching unconscious there for the apparent understanding he had of what he heard.<br />
&quot;Not Magnifico?&quot; Toran whispered the question.<br />
&quot;Listen!&quot; said Bayta. &quot;Do you remember what happened on Neotrantor? Oh, think for yourself, Torie?<br />
But he shook his head and mumbled at her.<br />
She went on, wearily, &quot;A man died on Neotrantor. A man died with no one touching him. Isn't that true? Magnifico played on his Visi-Sonor and when he was finished, the crown prince was dead. Now isn't that strange? Isn't it queer that a creature afraid of everything, apparently helpless with terror, has the capacity to kill at will.&quot;<br />
&quot;The music and the light-effects,&quot; said Toran, &quot;have a profound emotional effect?<br />
&quot;Yes, an emotional effect. A pretty big one. Emotional effects happen to be the Mule's specialty. That, I suppose, can be considered a coincidence. And a creature who can kill by suggestion is so full of fright. Well, the Mule tampered with his mind, supposedly, so that can be explained. But, Toran, I caught a little of that Visi-Sonor selection that killed the crown prince. Just a little¡­¡­but it was enough to give me that same feeling of despair I had in the Time Vault and on Haven. Toran, I can't mistake that particular feeling.&quot;<br />
Toran's face was darkening. &quot;I ... felt it, too. I forgot. I never thought?<br />
&quot;It was then that it first occurred to me. It was just a vague feeling¡­¡­intuition, if you like. I had nothing to go on. And then Pritcher told us of the Mule and his mutation, and it was clear in a moment. It was the Mule who had created the despair in the Time Vault; it was Magnifico who had created the despair on Neotrantor. It was the same emotion. Therefore, the Mule and Magnifico were the same person. Doesn't it work out nicely, Torie? Isn't it just like an axiom in geometry¡­¡­things equal to the same thing are equal to each other?&quot;<br />
She was at the edge of hysteria, but dragged herself back to sobriety by main force. She continued, &quot;The discovery scared me to death. If Magnifico were the Mule, he could know my emotions¡­¡­and cure them for his own purposes. I dared not let him know. I avoided him. Luckily, he avoided me also; he was too interested in Ebling Mis. I planned killing Mis before he could talk. I planned it secretly¡­¡­as secretly as I could¡­¡­so secretly I didn't dare tell it to myself.<br />
&quot;If I could have killed the Mule himself¡­¡­But I couldn't take the chance. He would have noticed, and I would have lost everything.&quot;<br />
She seemed drained of emotion.<br />
Toran said harshly and with finality, &quot;It's impossible. Look at the miserable creature. He the Mule? He doesn't even hear what we're saying.&quot;<br />
But when his eyes followed his pointing finger, Magnifico was erect and alert, his eyes sharp and darkly bright. His voice was without a trace of an accent, &quot;I hear her, my friend. It is merely that I have been sitting here and brooding on the fact that with all my cleverness and forethought I could make a mistake, and lose so much.&quot;<br />
Toran stumbled backward as if afraid the clown might touch him or that his breath might contaminate him.<br />
Magnifico nodded, and answered the unspoken question. &quot;I am the Mule.&quot;<br />
He seemed no longer a grotesque; his pipestem limbs, his beak of a nose lost their humor-compelling qualities. His fear was gone; his bearing was firm.<br />
He was in command of the situation with an ease born of usage.<br />
He said, tolerantly, &quot;Seat yourselves. Go ahead; you might as well sprawl out and make yourselves comfortable. The game's over, and I'd like to tell you a story. It's a weakness of mine¡­¡­I want people to understand me.&quot;<br />
And his eyes as he looked at Bayta were still the old, soft sad brown ones of Magnifico, the clown.<br />
&quot;There is nothing really to my childhood,&quot; he began, plunging bodily into quick, impatient speech, &quot;that I care to remember. Perhaps you can understand that. My meagerness is glandular; my nose I was born with. It was not possible for me to lead a normal childhood. My mother died before she saw me. I do not know my father. I grew up haphazard, wounded and tortured in mind, full of self-pity and hatred of others. I was known then as a queer child. All avoided me; most out of dislike; some out of fear. Queer incidents occurred¡­¡­Well, never mind! Enough happened to enable Captain Pritcher, in his investigation of my childhood to realize that I was a mutant, which was more than I ever realized until I was in my twenties.&quot;<br />
Toran and Bayta listened distantly. The wash of his voice broke over them, seated on the ground as they were, unheeded almost. The clown¡­¡­or the Mule¡­¡­paced before them with little steps, speaking downward to his own folded arms.<br />
&quot;The whole notion of my unusual power seems to have broken on me so slowly, in such sluggish steps. Even toward the end, I couldn't believe it. To me, men's minds are dials, with pointers that indicate the prevailing emotion. It is a poor picture, but how else can I explain it? Slowly, I learned that I could reach into those minds and turn the pointer to the spot I wished, that I could nail it there forever. And then it took even longer to realize that others couldn't.<br />
&quot;But the consciousness of power came, and with it, the desire to make up for the miserable position of my earlier life. Maybe you can understand it. Maybe you can try to understand it. It isn't easy to be a freak¡­¡­to have a mind and an understanding and be a freak. Laughter and cruelty! To be different! To be an outsider!<br />
&quot;You've never been through it!&quot;<br />
Magnifico looked up to the sky and teetered on the balls of his feet and reminisced stonily, &quot;But I eventually did learn, and I decided that the Galaxy and I could take turns. Come, they had???? their innings, and I had been patient about it¡­¡­for twenty-two years. My turn! It would be up to the rest of you to take it! And the odds would be fair enough for the Galaxy. One of me! Quadrillions of them!&quot;<br />
He paused to glance at Bayta swiftly. &quot;But I had a weakness. I was nothing in myself. If I could gain power, it could only be by means of others. Success came to me through middlemen. Always! It was as Pritcher said. Through a pirate, I obtained my first asteroidal base of operations. Through an industrialist I got my first foothold on a planet. Through a variety of others ending with the warlord of Kalgan, I won Kalgan itself and got a navy. After that, it was the Foundation¡­¡­and you two come into the story.<br />
&quot;The Foundation,&quot; he said, softly, &quot;was the most difficult task I had met. To beat it, I would have to win over, break down, or render useless an extraordinary proportion of its ruling class. I could have done it from scratch¡­¡­but a short cut was possible, and I looked for it. After all, if a strong man can lift five hundred pounds, it does not mean that he is eager to do so continuously. My emotional control is not an easy task, I prefer not to use it, where not fully necessary. So I accepted allies in my first attack upon the Foundation.<br />
&quot;As my clown, I looked for the agent, or agents, of the Foundation that must inevitably have been sent to Kalgan to investigate my humble self. I know now it was Han Pritcher I was looking for. By a stroke of fortune, I found you instead. I am a telepath, but not a complete one, and, my lady, you were from the Foundation. I was led astray by that. It was not fatal for Pritcher joined us afterward, but it was the starting point of an error that was fatal.&quot;<br />
Toran stirred for the first time. He spoke in an outraged tone, &quot;Hold on, now. You mean that when I outfaced that lieutenant on Kalgan with only a stun pistol, and rescued you¡­¡­that you had emotionally-controlled me into it.&quot; He was spluttering. &quot;You mean I've been tampered with all along.&quot;<br />
A thin smile played on Magnifico's face. &quot;Why not? You don't think it's likely? Ask yourself then¡­¡­Would you have risked death for a strange grotesque you had never seen before, if you had been in your right mind? I imagine you were surprised at events in cold after-blood.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bayta, distantly, &quot;he was. It's quite plain.&quot;<br />
&quot;As it was,&quot; continued the Mule, &quot;Toran was in no danger. The lieutenant had his own strict instructions to let us go. So the three of us and Pritcher went to the Foundation¡­¡­and see how my campaign shaped itself instantly. When Pritcher was court-martialed and we were present, I was busy. The military judges of that trial later commanded their squadrons in the war. They surrendered rather easily, and my Navy won the battle of Horleggor, and other lesser affairs.<br />
&quot;Through Pritcher, I met Dr. Mis, who brought me a Visi-Sonor, entirely of his own accord, and simplified my task immensely. Only it wasn't entirely of his own accord.&quot;<br />
Bayta interrupted, &quot;Those concerts! I've been trying to fit them in. Now I see.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Magnifico, &quot;the Visi-Sonor acts as a focusing device. In a way, it is a primitive device for emotional control in itself. With it, I can handle people in quantity and single people more intensively. The concerts I gave on Terminus before it fell and Haven before it fell contributed to the general defeatism. I might have made the crown prince of Neotrantor very sick without the Visi-Sonor, but I could not have killed him. You see?<br />
&quot;But it was Ebling Mis who was my most important find. He might have been? Magnifico said it with chagrin, then hurried on, &quot;There is a special facet to emotional control you do not know about. Intuition or insight or hunch-tendency, whatever you wish to call it, can be treated as an emotion. At least, I can treat it so. You don't understand it, do you?&quot;<br />
He waited for no negative, &quot;The human mind works at low efficiency. Twenty percent is the figure usually given. When, momentarily, there is a flash of greater power it is termed a hunch, or insight, or intuition. I found early that I could induce a continual use of high brain-efficiency. It is a killing process for the person affected, but it is useful. The nuclear field-depressor which I used in the war against the Foundation was the result of high-pressuring a Kalgan technician. Again I work through others.<br />
&quot;Ebling Mis was the bull's-eye. His potentialities were high, and I needed him. Even before my war with the Foundation had opened, I had already sent delegates to negotiate with the Empire. It was at that time I began my search for the Second Foundation. Naturally, I didn't find it. Naturally, I knew that I must find it¡­¡­and Ebling Mis was the answer. With his mind at high efficiency, he might possibly have duplicated the work of Hari Seldon.<br />
&quot;Partly, he did. I drove him to the utter limit. The process was ruthless, but had to be completed. He was dying at the end, but he lived? Again, his chagrin interrupted him. &quot;He would have lived long enough. Together, we three could have gone onward to the Second Foundation. It would have been the last battle¡­¡­but for my mistake.&quot;<br />
Toran stirred his voice to hardness, &quot;Why do you stretch it out so? What was your mistake, and ... and have done with your speech.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why, your wife was the mistake. Your wife was an unusual person. I had never met her like before in my life. I ... I? Quite suddenly, Magnifico's voice broke. He recovered with difficulty. There was a grimness about him as he continued. &quot;She liked me without my having to juggle her emotions. She was neither repelled by me nor amused by me. She liked me!<br />
&quot;Don't you understand? Can't you see what that would mean to me? Never before had anyone¡­¡­Well, I ... cherished that. My own emotions played me false, though I was master of all others. I stayed out of her mind, you see; I did not tamper with it. I cherished the natural feeling too greatly. It was my mistake¡­¡­the first.<br />
&quot;You, Toran, were under control. You never suspected me; never questioned me; never saw anything peculiar or strange about me. As for instance, when the 'Filian' ship stopped us. They knew our location, by the way, because I was in communication with them, as I've remained in communication with my generals at all times. When they stopped us, I was taken aboard to adjust Han Pritcher, who was on it as a prisoner. When I left, he was a colonel, a Mule's man, and in command. The whole procedure was too open even for you, Toran. Yet you accepted my explanation of the matter, which was full of fallacies. See what I mean?&quot;<br />
Toran grimaced, and challenged him, &quot;How did you retain communications with your generals?&quot;?<br />
&quot;There was no difficulty to it. Hyperwave transmitters are easy to handle and eminently portable. Nor could I be detected in a real sense! Anyone who did catch me in the act would leave me with a slice gapped out of his memory. It happened, on occasion.<br />
&quot;On Neotrantor, my own foolish emotions betrayed me again. Bayta was not under my control, but even so might never have suspected me if I had kept my head about the crown prince. His intentions towards Bayta¡­¡­annoyed me.<br />
&quot;I killed him. It was a foolish gesture. An unobtrusive flight would have served as well.<br />
&quot;And still your suspicions would not have been certainties, if I had stopped Pritcher in his well-intentioned babbling, or paid less attention to Mis and more to you? He shrugged.<br />
&quot;That's the end of it?&quot; asked Bayta.<br />
&quot;That's the end.&quot;<br />
&quot;What now, then?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll continue with my program. That I'll find another as adequately brained and trained as Ebling Mis in these degenerate days, I doubt. I shall have to search for the Second Foundation otherwise. In a sense you have defeated me.&quot;<br />
And now Bayta was upon her feet, triumphant. &quot;In a sense? Only in a sense? We have defeated you entirely! All your victories outside the Foundation count for nothing, since the Galaxy is a barbarian vacuum now. The Foundation itself is only a minor victory, since it wasn't meant to stop your variety of crisis. It's the Second Foundation you must beat¡­¡­the Second Foundation¡­¡­and it's the Second Foundation that will defeat you. Your only chance was to locate it and strike it before it was prepared. You won't do that now. Every minute from now on, they will be readier for you. At this moment, at this moment, the machinery may have started. You'll know¡­¡­when it strikes you, and your short term of power will be over, and you'll be just another strutting conqueror, flashing quickly and meanly across the bloody face of history.&quot;<br />
She was breathing hard, nearly gasping in her vehemence, &quot;And we've defeated you, Toran and I. I am satisfied to die.&quot;<br />
But the Mule's sad, brown eyes were the sad, brown, loving eyes of Magnifico. &quot;I won't kill you or your husband. It is, after all, impossible for you two to hurt me further; and killing you won't bring back Ebling Mis. My mistakes were my own, and I take responsibility for them. Your husband and yourself may leave! Go in peace, for the sake of what I call¡­¡­friendship.&quot;<br />
Then, with a sudden touch of pride, &quot;And meanwhile I am still the Mule, the most powerful man in the Galaxy. I shall still defeat the Second Foundation.&quot;<br />
And Bayta shot her last arrow with a firm, calm certitude, &quot;You won't! I have faith in the wisdom of Seldon yet. You shall be the last ruler of your dynasty, as well as the first.&quot;<br />
Something caught Magnifico. &quot;Of my dynasty? Yes, I had thought of that, often. That I might establish a dynasty. That I might have a suitable consort.&quot;<br />
Bayta suddenly caught the meaning of the look in his eyes and froze horribly.<br />
Magnifico shook his head. &quot;I sense your revulsion, but that's silly. If things were otherwise, I could make you happy very easily. It would be an artificial ecstasy, but there would be no difference between it and the genuine emotion. But things are not otherwise. I call myself the Mule¡­¡­but not because of my strength¡­¡­obviously?<br />
He left them, never looking back.<br />

ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br />
Isaac Asimov was born in the Soviet union to his great surprise. He moved quickly to correct the situation. When his parents emigrated to the United States, Isaac (three years old at the time) stowed away in their baggage. He has been an American citizen since the age of eight.<br />
Brought up in Brooklyn, and educated in its public schools, he eventually found his way to Columbia University and, over the protests of the school administration, managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry, up to and including a Ph.D. He then infiltrated Boston University and climbed the academic ladder, ignoring all cries of outrage, until he found himself Professor of Biochemistry.<br />
Meanwhile, at the age of nine, he found the love of his life (in the inanimate sense) when he discovered his first science-fiction magazine. By the time he was eleven, he began to write stories, and at eighteen, he actually worked up the nerve to submit one. It was rejected. After four long months of tribulation and suffering, he sold his first story and, thereafter, he never looked back.<br />
In 1941, when he was twenty-one years old, he wrote the classic short story &quot;Nightfall&quot; and his future was assured. Shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories, and shortly after that he had begun his Foundation series.<br />
What was left except quantity? At the present time, he has published over 260 books, distributed through every major division of the Dewey system of library classification, and shows no signs of slowing up. He remains as youthful, as lively, and as lovable as ever, and grows more handsome with each year. You can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious.<br />
He is married to Janet Jeppson, psychiatrist and writer, has two children by a previous marriage, and lives in New York City.?<br />
