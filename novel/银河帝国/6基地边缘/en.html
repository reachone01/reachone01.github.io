<p>&quot;Nonsense. You were just right. I was afraid that you had been keptactive and drained by that young woman, but you assured me you hadnot. That it true, isn't it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Have I acted like someone who was half-sated to begin with?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you did not,&quot; and her laughter boomed.<br />
  Are you still thinking of Psychic Probes?She laughed again. &quot;Are you mad? Would I want to lose younow ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet it would be better if you lost me temporarily &quot;<br />
&quot;What!&quot; She frowned.<br />
  If I were to stay here permanently, my my dear, how longwould it be before eyes would begin to watch, and mouths would begin towhisper? It I went off on my mission, however, I would naturally returnperiodically to, report, and it would then be only natural that we shouldbe closeted together for a while and my mission is important.She thought about that, scratching idly at her right hip. Then shesaid, &quot;I suppose you're right. I hate the thought but I supposeyou're right.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you need not think I would not come back,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I amnot so witless as to forget what I would have waiting for me here.&quot;She smiled at him, touched his cheek gently, and said, looking intohis eyes, &quot;Did you find it pleasant, love?&quot;<br />
&quot;Much more than pleasant, dear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet you are a Foundationer. A man in the prime of youth fromTerminus itself. You must be accustomed to all sorts of women with allsoul skills &quot;<br />
&quot;I have encountered nothing nothing  in theleast like you,&quot; said Trevize, with a forcefulness that came easily tosomeone who was but telling the truth, after all.<br />
  Lizalor said complacently, &quot;Well, if you say so. Still, old habitsdie hard, you know, and I don't think I could bring myself to trust aman's word without some sort of surety. You and your friend, Pelorat,might conceivably go on this mission of yours once I hear about it andapprove, but I will keep the young woman here. She will be well treated,never fear, but I presume your Dr. Pelorat will want her, and he willsee to it that there are frequent returns to Comporellon, even if yourenthusiasm for this mission you to stay away too long.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, Lizalor, that's impossible.&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed?&quot; Suspicion at once seeped into her eyes. &quot;Why impossible? Forwhat purpose would you need the woman?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not for sex. I told you that, and I told you truthfully. She isPelorat's and I have no interest in her. Besides, I'm sure she'd breakin two if she attempted what you so triumphantly carried through.&quot;Lizalor almost smiled, but repressed it and said severely, &quot;What isit to you, then, if she remains on Comporellon?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because she is of essential importance to our mission. That is whywe must have her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, then, what is your mission? It is time you told me.&quot;Trevize hesitated very briefly. It would have to be the truth. Hecould think of no lie as effective.<br />
  Listen to me, he said. &quot;Comporellon may be an old world, even amongthe oldest, but it can't be the oldest. Human life did notoriginate here. The earliest human beings reached here from some otherworld, and perhaps human life didn't originate there either, but camefrom still another and still older world. Eventually, though, thoseprobings back into time must stop, and we must reach the first world,the world of human origins. I am seeking Earth.&quot;The change that suddenly came over Mitza Lizalor staggered him.<br />
  Her eyes had widened, her breathing took on a sudden urgency, andevery muscle seemed to stiffen as she lay there in bed. Her arms shotupward rigidly, and the first two fingers of both hands crossed.<br />
  You named it, she whispered hoarsely.<br />
  23She didn't say anything after that; she didn't look athim. Her arms slowly came down, her legs swung over the side of the bed,and she sat up, back to him. Trevize lay where he was, frozen.<br />
  He could hear, in memory, the words of Munn Li Compor, as theystood there in the empty tourist center at Sayshell. He could hear himsaying of his own ancestral planet the one that Trevize was onnow &quot;They're superstitious about it. Every time they mention theword, they lift up both hands with first and second fingers crossed toward off misfortune.&quot;How useless to remember after the fact.<br />
  What should I have said, Mitza? he muttered.<br />
  She shook her head slightly, stood up, stalked toward and then througha door. It closed behind her and, after a moment, there was the soundof water running.<br />
  He had no recourse but to wait, bare, undignified, wondering whetherto join her in the shower, and then quite certain he had better not. Andbecause, in a way, he felt the shower denied him, he at once experienceda growing need for one.<br />
  She emerged at last and silently began to select clothing.<br />
  He said, &quot;Do you mind if I &quot;She said nothing, and he took silence for consent. He tried to strideinto the room in a strong and masculine way but he felt uncommonly ashe had in those days when his mother, offended by some misbehavior onhis part, offered him no punishment but silence, causing him to shrivelin discomfort.<br />
  He looked about inside the smoothly walled cubicle that wasbare-completely bare. He looked more minutely. There wasnothing.<br />
  He opened the door again, thrust his head out, and said, &quot;Listen,how are you supposed to start the shower?&quot;She put down the deodorant (at least, Trevize guessed that was itsfunction), strode to the shower-room and, still without looking at him,pointed. Trevize followed the finger and noted a spot on the wall that wasround and faintly pink, barely colored, as though the designer resentedhaving to spoil the starkness of the white, for no reason more importantthan to give a hint of function.<br />
  Trevize shrugged lightly, leaned toward the wall, and touched thespot. Presumably that was what one had to do, for in a moment a deluge offine-sprayed water struck him from every direction. Gasping, he touchedthe spot again and it stopped.<br />
  He opened the door, knowing he looked several degrees more undignifiedstill as he shivered hard enough to make it difficult to articulatewords. He croaked, &quot;How do you get hot water?&quot;Now she looked at him and, apparently, his appearance overcame heranger (or fear, or whatever emotion was victimizing her) for she snickeredand then, without warning, boomed her laughter at him.<br />
  What hot water? she said. &quot;Do you think we're going to wastethe energy to heat water for washing? That's good mild water you had,water with the chill taken off. What more do you want? You sludge-softTerminians! Get back in there and wash!&quot;Trevize hesitated, but not for long, since it was clear he had nochoice in the matter.<br />
  With remarkable reluctance he touched the pink spot again and this timesteeled his body for the icy spray. Mild water? He foundsuds forming on his body and he rubbed hastily here, there, everywhere,judging it to be the wash cycle and suspecting it would not last long.<br />
  Then came the rinse cycle. Ah, warm Well, perhaps not warm, butnot quite as cold, and definitely feeling warm to his thoroughly chilledbody. Then, even as he was considering touching the contact spot againto stop the water, and was wondering how Lizalor had come out dry whenthere was absolutely no towel or towel-substitute in the place thewater stopped. It was followed by a blast of air that would have certainlybowled him over if it had not come from various directions equally.<br />
  It was hot; almost too hot. It took far less energy, Trevize knew,to heat air than to heat water. The hot air steamed the water off himand, in a few minutes, he was able to step out as dry as though he hadnever encountered water in his life.<br />
  Lizalor seemed to have recovered completely. &quot;Do you feel well?&quot;<br />
&quot;Pretty well,&quot; said Trevize. Actually, he felt astonishinglycomfortable. &quot;All I had to do was prepare myself for the temperature. Youdidn't tell me &quot;<br />
&quot;Sludge-soft,&quot; said Lizalor, with mild contempt.<br />
  He borrowed her deodorant, then began to dress, conscious of the factthat she had fresh underwear and he did not. He said, &quot;What should Ihave called that world?&quot;She said, &quot;We refer to it as the Oldest.&quot;He said, &quot;How was I to know the name I used was forbidden? Did youtell me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;How was I to know to ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;You know now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm bound to forget.&quot;<br />
&quot;You had better not.&quot;<br />
&quot;What's the difference?&quot; Trevize felt his temper rising. &quot;It's justa word, a sound.&quot;Lizalor said darkly, &quot;There are words one doesn't say. Do you sayevery word you know under all circumstances?&quot;<br />
&quot;Some words are vulgar, some are inappropriate, some under particularcircumstances would be hurtful. Which is that word I used?&quot;Lizalor said, &quot;It's a sad word, a solemn word. It represents a worldthat was ancestor to us all and that now doesn't exist. It's tragic,and we feel it because it was near to us. We prefer not to speak of itor, if we must, not to use its name.&quot;<br />
&quot;And the crossing of fingers at me? How does that relieve the hurtand sadness?&quot;Lizalor's face flushed. &quot;That was an automatic reaction, and I don'tthank you for forcing it on me. There are people who believe that theword, even the thought, brings on misfortune and that is how theyward it off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you, too, believe crossing fingers wards off misfortune?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Well, yes, in a way. It makes me uneasy if I don't doit.&quot; She didn't look at him. Then, as though eager to shift the subject,she said quickly, &quot;And how is that black-haired woman of yours of theessence with respect to your mission to reach that world youmentioned.&quot;<br />
&quot;Say `the Oldest.' Or would you rather not even say that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I would rather not discuss it at all, but I asked you a question.&quot;<br />
&quot;I believe that her people reached their present world as emigrantsfrom the Oldest.&quot;<br />
&quot;As we did,&quot; said Lizalor proudly.<br />
  But her people have traditions of some sort which she says are thekey to understanding the Oldest, but only if we reach it and can studyits records.&quot;She is lying.&quot;Perhaps, but we must check it out.&quot;If you have this woman with her problematical knowledge, and if youwant to reach the Oldest with her, why did you come to Comporellon?&quot;To find the location of the Oldest. I had a friend once, who, likemyself, was a Foundationer. He, however, was descended from Comporellianancestors and he assured me that much of the history of the Oldest waswell known, on Comporellon.&quot;Did he indeed? And did he tell you any of itshistory?&quot;Yes, said Trevize, reaching for the truth again. &quot;He said thatthe Oldest was a dead world, entirely radioactive. He did not know why,but he thought that it might be the result of nuclear explosions. In awar, perhaps.&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot; said Lizalor explosively.<br />
  No, there was no war? Or no, the Oldest is not radioactive?&quot;It is radioactive, but there was no war.&quot;Then how did it become radioactive? It could not have been radioactiveto begin with since human life began on the Oldest. There would havebeen no life on it ever.Lizalor seemed to hesitate. She stood erect, and was breathing deeply,almost gasping. She said, &quot;It was a punishment. It was a world that usedrobots. Do you know what robots are?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;They had robots and for that they were punished. Every world thathas had robots has been punished and no longer exists.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who punished them, Lizalor?&quot;<br />
&quot;He Who Punishes. The forces of history. I don't know.&quot; She looked awayfrom him, uncomfortable, then said, in a lower voice, &quot;Ask others.&quot;<br />
&quot;I would like to, but whom do I ask? Are there those on Comporellonwho have studied primeval history?&quot;<br />
&quot;There are. They are not popular with us with the averageComporellian but the Foundation, your Foundation,insists on intellectual freedom, as they call it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not a bad insistence, in my opinion,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  All is bad that is imposed from without, said Lizalor.<br />
  Trevize shrugged. There was no purpose in arguing the matter. He sald,&quot;My friend, Dr. Pelorat, is himself a primeval historian of a sort. Hewould, I'm sure, like to meet his Comporellian colleagues. Can youarrange that, Lizalor?&quot;She nodded. &quot;There is a historian named Vasil Deniador, who is basedat the University here in the city. He does not teach class, but he maybe able to tell you what you want to know.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why doesn't he teach class?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's not that he is forbidden; it's just that students do not electhis course.&quot;<br />
&quot;I presume,&quot; said Trevize, trying not to say it sardonically, &quot;thatthe students are encouraged not to elect it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why should they want to? He is a Skeptic. We have them, youknow. There are always individuals who pit their minds against thegeneral modes of thought and who are arrogant enough to feel that theyalone are right and that the many are wrong.&quot;<br />
&quot;Might it not be that that could actually be so in some cases?&quot;<br />
&quot;Never!&quot; snapped Lizalor, with a firmness of belief that made itquite clear that no further discussion in that direction would be of anyuse. &quot;And for all his Skepticism, he will be forced to tell you exactlywhat any Comporellian would tell you.&quot;<br />
&quot;And that is?&quot;<br />
&quot;That if you search for the Oldest, you will not find it.&quot;24In the private quarters assigned them, Pelorat listenedto Trevize thoughtfully, his long solemn face expressionless, then said,&quot;Vasil Deniador? I do not recall having heard of him, but it may be thatback on the ship I will find papers by him in my library.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you haven't heard of him? Think!&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  I don't recall, at the moment, having heard of him, said Peloratcautiously, &quot;but after all, my dear chap, there must be hundreds ofestimable scholars I haven't heard of; or have, but can't remember.&quot;<br />
&quot;Still, he can't be first-class, or you would have heard of him.&quot;<br />
&quot;The study of Earth &quot;<br />
&quot;Practice saying `the Oldest,' Janov. It would complicate mattersotherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;The study of the Oldest,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;is not a well-rewarded nichein the corridors of learning, so that first-class scholars, even in thefield of primeval history, would not tend to find their way there. Or,if we put it the other way around, those who are already there do notmake enough of a name for themselves in an uninterested world to beconsidered first-class, even if they were. I am notfirst-class in anyone's estimation, I am sure.&quot;Bliss said tenderly, &quot;In mine, Pel.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, certainly in yours, my dear,&quot; said Pelorat, smiling slightly,&quot;but you are not judging me in my capacity as scholar.&quot;It was almost night now, going by the clock, and Trevize felt himselfgrow slightly impatient, as he always did when Bliss and Pelorat tradedendearments.<br />
  He said, &quot;I'll try to arrange our seeing this Deniador tomorrow,but if he knows as little about the matter as the Minister does, we'renot going to be much better off than we are now.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;He may be able to lead us to someone more useful.&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt it. This world's attitude toward Earth but I had betterpractice speaking of it elliptically, too. This world's attitude towardthe Oldest is a foolish and superstitious one.&quot; He turned away. &quot;Butit's been a rough day and we ought to think of an evening meal ifwe can face their uninspired cookery and then begin thinking ofgetting some sleep. Have you two learned how to use the shower?&quot;<br />
&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;we have been very kindlytreated. We've received all sorts of instructions, most of which wedidn't need.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Listen, Trevize. What about the ship?&quot;<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Is the Comporellian government confiscating it?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I don't think they will.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah. Very pleasant. Why aren't they?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because I persuaded the Minister to change her mind.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Astonishing. She didn't seem a particularly persuadableindividual to me.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I don't know. It was clear from the texture of her mindthat she was attracted to Trevize.&quot;Trevize looked at Bliss with sudden exasperation. &quot;Did you do that,Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean, Trevize?&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean tamper with her &quot;<br />
&quot;I didn't tamper. However, when I noted that she was attracted toyou, I couldn't resist just snapping an inhibition or two. It was avery small thing to do. Those inhibitions might have snapped anyway,and it seemed to be important to make certain that she was filled withgood will toward you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good will? It was more than that! She softened, yes, butpost-coitally.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Surely you don't mean, old man &quot;<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; said Trevize testily. &quot;She may be past her first youth,but she knew the art well. She was no beginner, I assure you. Nor will Iplay the gentleman and lie on her behalf. It was her idea thanksto Bliss's fiddling with her inhibitions and I was not in aposition to refuse, even if that thought had occurred to me, which itdidn't. Come, Janov, don't stand there looking puritanical. It'sbeen months since I've had an opportunity. You've &quot; And he wavedhis hand vaguely in Bliss's direction.<br />
  Believe me, Golan, said Pelorat, embarrassed, &quot;if you areinterpreting my expression as puritanical, you mistake me. I have noobjection.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;But she is puritanical. I meant to makeher warm toward you; I did not count on a sexual paroxysm.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;But that is exactly what you brought on, my littleinterfering Bliss. It may be necessary for the Minister to play thepuritan in public, but if so, that seems merely to stoke the fires.&quot;<br />
&quot;And so, provided you scratch the itch, she will betray theFoundation &quot;<br />
&quot;She would have done that in any case,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;She wantedthe ship &quot; He broke off, and said in a whisper, &quot;Are we beingoverheard?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;No!&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
&quot;It is certain. It is impossible to impinge upon the mind of Gaia inany unauthorized fashion without Gaia being aware of it.&quot;<br />
&quot;In that case, Comporellon wants the ship for itself a valuableaddition to its fleet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Surely, the Foundation would not allow that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Comporellon does not intend to have the Foundation know.&quot;Bliss sighed. &quot;There are your Isolates. The Minister intends tobetray the Foundation on behalf of Comporellon and, in return for sex,will promptly betray Comporellon, too. And as for Trevize, he willgladly sell his body's services as a way of inducing the betrayal. Whatanarchy there is in this Galaxy of yours. What chaos .&quot;Trevize said coldly, &quot;You are wrong, young woman &quot;<br />
&quot;In what I have just said, I am not a young woman, I am Gaia. I amall of Gaia.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then you are wrong, Gaia . I did not sell my body'sservices. I gave them gladly. I enjoyed it and did no one harm. As forthe consequences, they turned out well from my standpoint and I acceptthat. And if Comporellon wants the ship for its own purposes, who is tosay who is right in this matter? It is a Foundation ship, but it wasgiven to me to search for Earth. It is mine then until I complete thesearch and I feel that the Foundation has no right to go back on itsagreement. As for Comporellon, it does not enjoy Foundation domination,so it dreams of independence. In its own eyes, it is correct to do soand to deceive the Foundation, for that is not an act of treason to thembut an act of patriotism. Who knows?&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly. Who knows? In a Galaxy of anarchy, how is it possible to sortout reasonable actions from unreasonable ones? How decide between rightand wrong, good and evil, justice and crime, useful and useless? Andhow do you explain the Minister's betrayal of her own government, whenshe lets you keep the ship? Does she long for personal independencefrom an oppressive world? Is she a traitor or a personal one-womanself-patriot?&quot;<br />
&quot;To be truthful,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;I don't know that she was willing tolet me have my ship simply because she was grateful to me for the pleasureI gave her. I believe she made that decision only when I told her I wassearching for the Oldest. It is a world of ill-omen to her and we andthe ship that carries us, by searching for it, have become ill-omened,too. It is my feeling that she feet/ she incurred the ill-omen for herselfand her world by attempting to take the ship, which she may, by now,be viewing with horror. Perhaps she feels that by allowing us and ourship to leave and go about our business, she is averting the misfortunefrom Comporellon and is, in that way, performing a patriotic act.&quot;<br />
&quot;If that were so, which I doubt, Trevize, superstition is the springof the action. Do you admire that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I neither admire nor condemn. Superstition always directs action inthe absence of knowledge. The Foundation believes in the Seldon Plan,though no one in our realm can understand it, interpret its details,or use it to predict. We follow blindly out of ignorance and faith,and isn't that superstition?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, it might be.&quot;<br />
&quot;And Gaia, too. You believe I have given the correct decision injudging that Gaia should absorb the Galaxy into one large organism, butyou do not know why I should be right, or how safe it would be for you tofollow that decision. You are willing to go along only out of ignoranceand faith, and are even annoyed with me for trying to find evidencethat will remove the ignorance and make mere faith unnecessary. Isn'tthat superstition?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think he has you there, Bliss,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;Not so. He will either find nothing at all in this search,or he will find something that confirms his decision.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;And to back up that belief, you have only ignoranceand faith. In other words, superstition!&quot;25Vasil Deniador was a small man, little of feature, with a way oflooking up by raising his eyes without raising his head. This, combinedwith the brief smiles that periodically lit his face, gave him theappearance of laughing silently at the world.<br />
  His office was long and narrow, filled with tapes that seemed tobe in wild disorder, not because there was any definite evidence forthat, but because they were not evenly placed in their recesses so thatthey gave the shelves a snaggle-toothed appearance. The three seats heindicated for his visitors were not matched and showed signs of havingbeen recently, and imperfectly, dusted.<br />
  He said, &quot;Janov Pelorat, Golan Trevize, and Bliss. I do nothave your second name, madam.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss,&quot; she said, &quot;is all I am usually called,&quot; and sat down.<br />
  It is enough after all, said Deniador, twinkling at her. &quot;You areattractive enough to be forgiven if you had no name at all.&quot;All were sitting now. Deniador said, &quot;I have heard of you, Dr. Pelorat,though we have never corresponded. You are a Foundationer, are younot? From Terminus?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, Dr. Deniador.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you, Councilman Trevize. I seem to have heard that recently youwere expelled from the Council and exiled. I don't think I have everunderstood why.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not expelled, sir. I am still a member of the Council although Idon't know when I will take up my duties again. Nor exiled, quite. Iwas assigned a mission, concerning which we wish to consult you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Happy to try to help,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;And the blissful lady? Isshe from Terminus, too.&quot;Trevize interposed quickly. &quot;She is from elsewhere, Doctor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, a strange world, this Elsewhere. A most unusual collection ofhuman beings are native to it. But since two of you are from theFoundation's capital at Terminus, and the third is an attractive youngwoman, and Mitza Lizalor is not known for her affection for eithercategory, how is it that she recommends you to my care so warmly?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;to get rid of us. The sooner you help us,you see, the sooner we will leave Comporellon.&quot;Deniador eyed Trevize with interest (again the twinkling smile) andsaid, &quot;Of course, a vigorous young man such as yourself might attracther whatever his origin. She plays the role of cold vestal well, butnot perfectly.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know nothing about that,&quot; said Trevize stiffly.<br />
  And you had better not. In public, at least. But I am a Skepticand I am professionally unattuned to believing in surfaces. So come,Councilman, what is your mission? Let me find out if I can help you.Trevize said, &quot;In this, Dr. Pelorat is our spokesman.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have no objection to that,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;Dr. Pelorat?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;To put it at the simplest, dear Doctor, I have allmy mature life attempted to penetrate to the basic core of knowledgeconcerning the world on which the human species originated, and I wassent out along with my good friend, Golan Trevize although, tobe sure, I did not know him at the time to find, if we could,the uh Oldest, I believe you call it.&quot;<br />
&quot;The Oldest?&quot; said Deniador. &quot;I take it you mean Earth.&quot;Pelorat's jaw dropped. Then he said, with a slight stutter, &quot;I wasunder the impression that is, I was given to understand thatone did not &quot;He looked at Trevize, rather helplessly.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;Minister Lizalor told me that that word was not usedon Comporellon.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean she did this?&quot; Deniador's mouth turned downward, his nosescrewed up, and he thrust his arms vigorously forward, crossing thefirst two fingers on each hand.<br />
  Yes, said Trevize. &quot;That's what I mean.&quot;Deniador relaxed and laughed. &quot;Nonsense, gentlemen. We do it as amatter of habit, and in the backwoods they may be serious about it but,on the whole, it doesn't matter. I don't know any Comporellian whowouldn't say `Earth' when annoyed or startled. It's the most commonvulgarism we have.&quot;<br />
&quot;Vulgarism?&quot; said Pelorat faintly.<br />
  Or expletive, if you prefer.&quot;Nevertheless, said Trevize, &quot;the Minister seemed quite upset whenI used the word.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well, she's a mountain woman.&quot;<br />
&quot;What does that mean, sir?&quot;<br />
&quot;What it says. Mitza Lizalor is from the Central Mountain Range. Thechildren out there are brought up in what is called the good old-fashionedway, which means that no matter how well educated they become you cannever knock those crossed fingers out of them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then the word `Earth' doesn't bother you at all, does it,Doctor?&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  Not at all, dear lady. I am a Skeptic.Trevize said, &quot;I know what the word `skeptic' means in Galactic,but how do you use the word?&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly as you do, Councilman. I accept only what I am forcedto accept by reasonably reliable evidence, and keep that acceptancetentative pending the arrival of further evidence. That doesn't makeus popular.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  We wouldn't be popular anywhere. Where is the world whose people don'tprefer a comfortable, warm, and well-worn belief, however illogical,to the chilly winds of uncertainty? Consider how you believe inthe Seldon Plan without evidence.&quot;Yes, said Trevize, studying his finger ends. &quot;I put that forwardyesterday as an example, too.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;May I return to the subject, old fellow? What is knownabout Earth that a Skeptic would accept?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;Very little. We can assume that there is a singleplanet on which the human species developed, because it is unlikelyin the extreme that the same species, so nearly identical as to beinterfertile, would develop on a number of worlds, or even on just two,independently. We can choose to call this world of origin Earth. Thebelief is general, here, that Earth exists in this corner of the Galaxy,for the worlds here are unusually old and it is likely that the firstworlds to be settled were close to Earth rather than far from it.&quot;<br />
&quot;And has the Earth any unique characteristics aside from being theplanet of origin?&quot; asked Pelorat eagerly.<br />
  Do you have something in mind? said Deniador, with his quicksmile.<br />
  I'm thinking of its satellite, which some call the moon. That wouldbe unusual, wouldn't it?&quot;That's a leading question, Dr. Pelorat. You may be putting thoughtsinto my mind.&quot;I do not say what it is that would make the moon unusual.&quot;Its size, of course. Am I right? Yes, I see I am. All thelegends of Earth speak of its vast array of living species and of itsvast satellite one that is some three thousand to three thousandfive hundred kilometers in diameter. The vast array of life is easyto accept since it would naturally have come about through biologicalevolution, if what we know of the process is accurate. A giant satelliteis more difficult to accept. No other inhabited world in the Galaxy hassuch a satellite. Large satellites are invariably associated with theuninhabited and uninhabitable gas-giants. As a Skeptic, then, I prefernot to accept the existence of the moon.Pelorat said, &quot;If Earth is unique in its possession of millionsof species, might it not also be unique in its possession of a giantsatellite? One uniqueness might imply the other.&quot;Deniador smiled. &quot;I don't see how the presence of millions of specieson Earth could create a giant satellite out of nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;But the other way around Perhaps a giant satellite could helpcreate the millions of species.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't see how that could be either.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;What about the story of Earth's radioactivity?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is universally told; universally believed.&quot;<br />
&quot;But,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;Earth could not have been so radioactive as topreclude life in the billions of years when it supported life. How didit become radioactive? A nuclear war?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is the most common opinion, Councilman Trevize.&quot;<br />
&quot;From the manner in which you say that, I gather you don't believeit.&quot;<br />
&quot;There is no evidence that such a war took place. Common belief,even universal belief, is not, in itself, evidence.&quot;<br />
&quot;What else might have happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;There is no evidence that anything happened. The radioactivity mightbe as purely invented a legend as the large satellite.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;What is the generally accepted story of Earth'shistory? I have, during my professional career, collected a large numberof origin-legends, many of them involving a world called Earth, or somename very much like that. I have none from Comporellon, nothing beyondthe vague mention of a Benbally who might have come from nowhere forall that Comporellian legends say.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's not surprising. We don't usually export our legends and I'mastonished you have found references even to Benbally. Superstition,again.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you are not superstitious and you would not hesitate to talkabout it, would you?&quot;<br />
&quot;That's correct,&quot; said the small historian, casting his eyes upwardat Pelorat. &quot;It would certainly add greatly, perhaps even dangerously,to my unpopularity if I did, but you three are leaving Comporellon soonand I take it you will never quote me as a source.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have our word of honor,&quot; said Pelorat quickly.<br />
  &quot;Then here is a summary of what is supposed to have happened,shorn of any supernaturalism or moralizing. Earth existed as thesole world of human beings for an immeasurable period and then, abouttwenty to twenty-five thousand years ago, the human species developedinterstellar travel by way of the hyperspatial Jump and colonized agroup of planets.<br />
  The Settlers on these planets made use of robots, which had firstbeen devised on Earth before the days of hyperspatial travel and doyou know what robots are, by the way?&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot;<br />
&quot; said Trevize. &quot;<br />
&quot;We have been asked that more than once. We knowwhat robots are.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;The Settlers, with a thoroughly roboticized society, developeda high technology and unusual longevity and despised their ancestralworld. According to more dramatic versions of their story, they dominatedand oppressed the ancestral world.&quot;<br />
  Eventually, then, Earth sent out a new group of Settlers, amongwhom robots were forbidden. Of the new worlds, Comporellon was amongthe first. Our own patriots insist it was the first, butthere is no evidence of that that a Skeptic can accept. The first groupof Settlers died out, and Trevize said, &quot;Why did the first set die out, Dr. Deniador?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why? Usually they are imagined by our romantics as having beenpunished for their crimes by He Who Punishes, though no one bothersto say why He waited so long. But one doesn't have to resort to fairytales. It is easy to argue that a society that depends totally on robotsbecomes soft and decadent, dwindling and dying out of sheer boredom or,more subtly, by losing the will to live.<br />
  The second wave of Settlers, without robots, lived on and took overthe entire Galaxy, but Earth grew radioactive and slowly dropped out ofsight. The reason usually given for this is that there were robots onEarth, too, since the first wave had encouraged that.Bliss, who had listened to the account with some visible impatience,said, &quot;Well, Dr. Deniador, radioactivity or not, and however many wavesof settlers there might have been, the crucial question is a simpleone. Exactly where is Earth? What are its co-ordinates?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;The answer to that question is: I don't know. Butcome, it is time for lunch. I can have one brought in, and we can discussEarth over it for as long as you want.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don't know ?&quot; said Trevize, the sound of his voicerising in pitch and intensity.<br />
  Actually, as far as I know, no one knows.&quot;But that is impossible.&quot;Councilman, said Deniador, with a soft sigh, &quot;if you wish tocall the truth impossible, that is your privilege, but it will get younowhere.&quot;<br />
  Chapter 7: Leaving Comporellon<br />
  26Luncheon consisted of a heap of soft, crusty balls thatcame in different shades and that contained a variety of fillings.<br />
  Deniador picked up a small object which unfolded into a pair of thin,transparent gloves, and put them on. His guests followed suit.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;What is inside these objects, please?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;The pink ones are filled with spicy chopped fish, agreat Comporellian delicacy. These yellow ones contain a cheese fillingthat is very mild. The green ones contain a vegetable mixture. Do eatthem while they are a quite warm. Later we will have hot almond pie andthe usual beverages. I might recommend the hot cider. In a cold climate,we have a tendency to heat our foods, even desserts.&quot;<br />
&quot;You do yourself well,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  Not really, said Deniador. &quot;I'm being hospitable to guests. Formyself, I get along on very little. I don't have much body mass tosupport, as you have probably noticed.&quot;Trevize bit into one of the pink ones and found it very fishy indeed,with all overlay of spices that was pleasant to the taste but which,he thought, along with the fish itself, would remain with him for therest of the day and, perhaps, into the night.<br />
  When he withdrew the object with the bite taken out of it, he foundthat the crust had closed in over the contents. There was no squirt,no leakage, and, for a moment, he wondered at the purpose of thegloves. These seemed no chance of getting his hands moist and stickyif he didn't use them, so he decided it was a matter of hygiene. Thegloves substituted for a washing of the hands if that were inconvenientand custom, probably, now dictated their use even if the hands werewashed. (Lizalor hadn't used gloves when he had eaten with her the daybefore. Perhaps that was because she was a mountain woman.)He said, &quot;Would it be unmannerly to talk business over lunch?&quot;<br />
&quot;By Comporellian standards, Councilman, it would be, but you are myguests, and we will go by your standards. If you wish to speak seriously,and do not think or care that that might diminish yourpleasure in the food, please do so, and I will join you.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Thank you. Minister Lizalor implied no, shestated quite bluntly that Skeptics were unpopular on this world. Isthat so?&quot;Deniador's good humor seemed to intensify. &quot;Certainly. How hurt we'd beif we weren't. Comporellon, you see, is a frustrated world. Without anyknowledge of the details, there is the general mythic belief, that once,many millennia ago, when the inhabited Galaxy was small, Comporellonwas the leading world. We never forget that, and the fact that in knownhistory we have not been leaders irks us, fills us thepopulation in general, that is with a feeling of injustice.<br />
  &quot;Yet what can we do? The government was forced to be a loyal vassalof the Emperor once, and is a loyal Associate of the Foundation now. Andthe more we are made aware of our subordinate position, the strongerthe belief in the great, mysterious days of the past become.<br />
  What, then, can Comporellon do? They could never defy the Empire inolder times and they can't openly defy the Foundation now. They takerefuge, therefore, in attacking and hating us, since we don't believethe legends and laugh at the superstitions.&quot;<br />
  Nevertheless, we are safe from the grosser effects ofpersecution. We control the technology, and we fill the faculties of theUniversities. Some of us, who are particularly outspoken, have difficultyin teaching classes openly. I have that difficulty, for instance, thoughI have my students and hold meetings quietly off-campus. Nevertheless,if we were really driven out of public life, the technology wouldfail and the Universities would lose accreditation with the Galaxygenerally. Presumably, such is the folly of human beings, the prospectsof intellectual suicide might not stop them from indulging their hatred,but the Foundation supports us. Therefore, we are constantly scoldedand sneered at and denounced and never touched.Trevize said, &quot;Is it popular opposition that keeps you from tellingus where Earth is? Do you fear that, despite everything, the anti-Skepticfeeling might turn ugly if you go too far?&quot;Deniador shook his head. &quot;No. Earth's location is unknown. I am nothiding anything from you out of fear or for any other reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;But look,&quot; said Trevize urgently. &quot;There are a limited numberof planets in this sector of the Galaxy that possess the physicalcharacteristics associated with habitability, and almost all ofthem must be not only inhabitable, but inhabited, and therefore wellknown to you. How difficult would it be to explore the sector for aplanet that would be habitable were it not for the fact that it wasradioactive? Besides that, you would look for such a planet with a large,satellite in attendance. Between radioactivity and a large satellite,Earth would be absolutely unmistakable and could not be missed evenwith only a casual search. It might take some time but that would bethe only difficulty.&quot;Deniador said, &quot;The Skeptic's view is, of course, that Earth'sradioactivity and its large satellite are both simply legends. If welook for them, we look for sparrow-milk and rabbit-feathers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but that shouldn't stop Comporellon from at least takingon the search. If they find a radioactive world of the proper size forhabitability, with a large satellite, what an appearance of credibilityit would lend to Comporellian legendry in general.&quot;Deniador laughed. &quot;It may be that Comporellon doesn't search for thatvery reason. If we fail, or if we find an Earth obviously differentfrom the legends, the reverse would take place. Comporellian legendryin general would be blasted and made into a laughingstock. Comporellonwouldn't risk that.&quot;Trevize paused, then went on, very earnestly, &quot;Besides, even ifwe discount those two uniquities if there is such a word inGalactic of radioactivity and a large satellite, there is a thirdthat, by definition, must exist, without any reference to legends. Earthmust have upon it either a flourishing life of incredible diversity,or the remnants of one, or, at the very least, the fossil record of sucha one.&quot;Deniador said, &quot;Councilman, while Comporellon has sent out noorganized search party for Earth, we do have occasion totravel through space, and we occasionally have reports from ships thathave strayed from their intended routes for one reason or another. Jumpsare not always perfect, as perhaps you know. Nevertheless, there havebeen no reports of any planets with properties resembling those of thelegendary Earth, or any planet that is bursting with life. Nor is any shiplikely to land on what seems an uninhabited planet in order that the crewmight go fossil-hunting. If, then, in thousands of years nothing of thesort has been reported, I am perfectly willing to believe that locatingEarth is impossible, because Earth is not there to be located.&quot;Trevize said, in frustration, &quot;But Earth must besomewhere . Somewhere there is a planet on which humanityand all the familiar forms of life associated with humanity evolved. IfEarth is not in this section of the Galaxy, it must be elsewhere.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Deniador cold-bloodedly, &quot;but in all this time,it hasn't turned up anywhere.&quot;<br />
&quot;People haven't really looked for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, apparently you are. I wish you luck, but I would never bet onyour success.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Have there been attempts to determine the possibleposition of Earth by indirect means, by some means other than a directsearch?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said two voices at once. Deniador, who was the owner of one ofthe voices, said to Pelorat, &quot;Are you thinking of Yariff's project?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  Then would you explain it to the Councilman? I think he would morereadily believe you than me.Pelorat said, &quot;You see, Golan, in the last days of the Empire, therewas a time when the Search for Origins, as they called it, was a popularpastime, perhaps to get away from the unpleasantness of the surroundingreality. The Empire was in a process of disintegration at that time,you know.<br />
  &quot;It occurred to a Livian historian, Humbal Yariff, that whatever theplanet of origin, it would have settled worlds near itself sooner thanit would settle planets farther away. In general, the farther a worldfrom the point of origin the later it would have been settled.<br />
  Suppose, then, one recorded the date of settlement of all habitableplanets in the Galaxy, and made networks of all that were a given numberof millennia old. There could be a network drawn through all planets tenthousand years old; another through those twelve thousand years old, stillanother through those fifteen thousand years old. Each network would, intheory, be roughly spherical and they should be roughly concentric. Theolder networks would form spheres smaller in radius than the youngerones, and if one worked out all the centers they should fall within acomparatively small volume of space that would include the planet oforigin Earth.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pelorat's face was very earnest as he kept drawing spherical surfaceswith his cupped hands. &quot;<br />
&quot;Do you see my point, Golan?&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. But I take it that it didn't work.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Theoretically, it should have, old fellow. One trouble was that timesof origin were totally inaccurate. Every world exaggerated its own ageto one degree or another and there was no easy way of determining ageindependently of legend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss said, &quot;<br />
&quot;Carbon-14 decay in ancient timber.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly, dear,&quot;<br />
&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;<br />
&quot;but you would have had to getco-operation from the worlds in question, and that was never given. Noworld wanted its own exaggerated claim of age to be destroyed and theEmpire was then in no position to override local objections in a matterso unimportant. It had other things on its mind.&quot;<br />
  &quot;All that Yariff could do was to make use of worlds that were onlytwo thousand years old at most, and whose founding had been meticulouslyrecorded under reliable circumstances. There were few of those, andwhile they were distributed in roughly spherical symmetry, the centerwas relatively close to Trantor, the Imperial capital, because that waswhere the colonizing expeditions had originated for those relativelyfew worlds.<br />
  That, of course, was another problem. Earth was not the only point oforigin of settlement for other worlds. As time went on, the older worldssent out settlement expeditions of their own, and at the time of theheight of Empire, Trantor was a rather copious source of those. Yariffwas, rather unfairly, laughed at and ridiculed and his professionalreputation was destroyed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize said, &quot;<br />
&quot;I get the story, Janov. Dr. Deniador, is therethen nothing at all you could give me that represents the faintestpossibility of hope? Is there any other world where it is conceivablethere may be some information concerning Earth?&quot;<br />
&quot;Deniador sank into doubtful thought for a while. &quot;<br />
&quot;We-eeell,&quot;<br />
&quot; he saidat last, drawing out the word hesitantly, &quot;<br />
&quot;as a Skeptic I must tell youthat I'm not sure that Earth exists, or has ever existed. However &quot;<br />
&quot;He fell silent again.&quot;<br />
  Finally, Bliss said, &quot;I think you've thought of something that mightbe important, Doctor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Important? I doubt it,&quot; said Deniador faintly. &quot;Perhaps amusing,however. Earth is not the only planet whose position is a mystery. Thereare the worlds of the first group of Settlers; the Spacers, as theyare called in our legends. Some call the planets they inhabited the`Spacer worlds'; others call them the `Forbidden Worlds.' The lattername is now the usual one.<br />
  In their pride and prime, the legend goes, the Spacers had lifetimesstretching out for centuries, and refused to allow our own short-livedancestors to land on their worlds. After we had defeated them, thesituation was reversed. We scorned to deal with them and left them tothemselves, forbidding our own ships and Traders to deal with them. Hencethose planets became the Forbidden Worlds. We were certain, so the legendstates, that He Who Punishes would destroy them without our intervention,and, apparently, He did. At least, no Spacer has appeared in the Galaxyto our knowledge, in many millennia.&quot;Do you think that the Spacers would know about Earth? saidTrevize.<br />
  Conceivably, since their worlds were older than any of ours. That is,if any Spacers exist, which is extremely unlikely.&quot;Even if they don't exist, their worlds do and may containrecords.&quot;If you can find the worlds.Trevize looked exasperated. &quot;Do you mean to say that the key to Earth,the location of which is unknown, may be found on Spacer worlds, thelocation of which is also unknown?&quot;Deniador shrugged. &quot;We have had no dealings with them for twentythousand years. No thought of them. They, too, like Earth, have recededinto the mists.&quot;<br />
&quot;How many worlds did the Spacers live on?&quot;<br />
&quot;The legends speak of fifty such worlds a suspiciously roundnumber. There were probably far fewer.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you don't know the location of a single one of the fifty?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, now, I wonder &quot;<br />
&quot;What do you wonder?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;Since primeval history is my hobby, as it isDr. Pelorat's, I have occasionally explored old documents in search ofanything that might refer to early time; something more than legends. Lastyear, I came upon the records of an old ship, records that were almostindecipherable. It dated back to the very old days when our world wasnot yet known as Comporellon. The name `Baleyworld' was used, which,it seems to me, may be an even earlier form of the `Benbally world'<br />
  of our legends.&quot;Pelorat said, excitedly, &quot;Have you published?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;I do not wish to dive until I am sure thereis water in the swimming pool, as the old saying has it. You see, therecord says that the captain of the ship had visited a Spacer world andtaken off with him a Spacer woman.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;But you said that the Spacers did not allow visitors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly, and that is the reason I don't publish the material. Itsounds incredible. There are vague tales that could be interpreted asreferring to the Spacers and to their conflict with the Settlers ourown ancestors. Such tales exist not only on Comporellon but onmany worlds in many variations, but all are in absolute accord in onerespect. The two groups, Spacers and Settlers, did not mingle. Therewas no social contact, let alone sexual contact, and yet apparentlythe Settler captain and the Spacer woman were held together by bondsof love. This is so incredible that I see no chance of the story beingaccepted as anything but, at best, a piece of romantic historicalfiction.&quot;Trevize looked disappointed. &quot;Is that all?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Councilman, there is one more matter. I came across somefigures in what was left of the log of the ship that might or mightnot represent spatial co-ordinates. If they were and I repeat,since my Skeptic's honor compels me to, that they might not be theninternal evidence made me conclude they were the spatial co-ordinatesof three of the Spacer worlds. One of them might be the Spacer worldwhere the captain landed and from which he withdrew his Spacer love.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Might it not be that even if the tale is fiction,the coordinates are real?&quot;<br />
&quot;It might be,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;I will give you the figures, and youare free to use them, but you might get nowhere. And yet I havean amusing notion.&quot; His quick smile made its appearance.<br />
  What is that? said Trevize.<br />
  What if one of those sets of co-ordinates represented Earth?27Comporellon's sun, distinctly orange, was larger inappearance than the sun of Terminus, but it was low in the sky and gaveout little heat. The wind, fortunately light, touched Trevize's cheekwith icy fingers.<br />
  He shivered inside the electrified coat he had been given by MitzaLizalor, who now stood next to him. He said, &quot;It must warm up sometime,Mitza.&quot;She glanced up at the sun briefly, and stood there in the emptiness ofthe spaceport, showing no signs of discomfort tall, large, wearinga lighter coat than Trevize had on, and if not impervious to the cold,at least scornful of it.<br />
  She said, &quot;We have a beautiful summer. It is not a long one but ourfood crops are adapted to it. The strains are carefully chosen so thatthey grow quickly in the sun and do not frostbite easily. Our domesticanimals are well furred, and Comporellian wool is the best in the Galaxyby general admission. Then, too, we have farm settlements in orbitabout Comporellon that grow tropical fruit. We actually export cannedpineapples of superior flavor. Most people who know us as a cold worlddon't know that.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I thank you for coming to see us off, Mitza, and forbeing willing to co-operate with us on this mission of ours. For my ownpeace of mind, however, I must ask whether you will find yourself inserious trouble over this.&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot; She shook her head proudly. &quot;No trouble. In the first place, Iwill not be questioned. I am in control of transportation, which meansI alone set the rules for this spaceport and others, for the entrystations, for the ships that come and go. The Prime Minister dependson me for all that and is only too delighted to remain ignorant of itsdetails. And even if I were questioned, I have but to tell thetruth. The government would applaud me for not turning the ship over tothe Foundation. So would the people if it were safe to let them know. Andthe Foundation itself would not know of it.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;The government might be willing to keep the ship fromthe Foundation, but would they be willing to approve your letting ustake it away?&quot;Lizalor smiled. &quot;You are a decent human being, Trevize. You havefought tenaciously to keep your ship and now that you have it you takethe trouble to concern yourself with my welfare.&quot; She reached toward himtentatively as though tempted to give some sign of affection and then,with obvious difficulty, controlled the impulse.<br />
  She said, with a renewed brusqueness, &quot;Even if they question mydecision, I have but to tell them that you have been, and still are,searching for the Oldest, and they will say I did well to get rid ofyou as quickly as I did, ship and all, And they will perform the ritesof atonement that you were ever allowed to land in the first place,though there was no way we might have guessed what you were doing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you truly fear misfortune to yourself and the world because ofmy presence?&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Lizalor stolidly. Then she said, more softly, &quot;Youhave brought misfortune to me, already, for now that I have known you,Comporellian men will seem more sapless still. I will be left with anunappeasable longing. He Who Punishes has already seen to that.&quot;Trevize hesitated, then said, &quot;I do not wish you to change your mindon this matter, but I do not wish you to suffer needless apprehension,either. You must know that this matter of my bringing misfortune on youis simply superstition.&quot;<br />
&quot;The Skeptic told you that, I presume.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know it without his telling me.&quot;Lizalor brushed her face, for a thin rime was gathering on herprominent eyebrows and said, &quot;I know there are some who think itsuperstition. That the Oldest brings misfortune is, however, a fact. Ithas been demonstrated many times and all the clever Skeptical argumentscan't legislate the truth out of existence.&quot;She thrust out her hand suddenly. &quot;Good-bye, Golan. Get on the shipand join your companions before your soft Terminian body freezes in ourcold, but kindly wind.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good-bye, Mitza, and I hope to see you when I return.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, you have promised to return and I have tried to believe thatyou would. I have even told myself that I would come out and meet youat your ship in space so that misfortune would fall only on me and notupon my world but you will not return.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not so! I will! I would not give you up that easily, having hadpleasure of you.&quot; And at that moment, Trevize was firmly convinced thathe meant it.<br />
  I do not doubt your romantic impulses, my sweet Foundationer, butthose who venture outward on a search for the Oldest will never comeback anywhere. I know that in my heart.Trevize tried to keep his teeth from chattering. It was from coldand he didn't want her to think it was from fear. He said, &quot;That, too,is superstition.&quot;<br />
&quot;And yet,&quot; she said, &quot;that, too, is true.&quot;28It was good to be back in the pilot-room of theFar Star . It might be cramped for room. It might be a bubble ofimprisonment in infinite space. Nevertheless, it was familiar, friendly,and warm.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;I'm glad you finally came aboard. I was wondering howlong you would remain with the Minister.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not long,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It was cold.&quot;<br />
&quot;It seemed to me,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;that you were considering remainingwith her and postponing the search for Earth. I do not like to probeyour mind even lightly, but I was concerned for you and that temptationunder which you labored seemed to leap out at me.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;You're quite right. Momentarily at least, I felt thetemptation. The Minister is a remarkable woman and I've never met anyonequite like her. Did you strengthen my resistance, Bliss?&quot;She said, &quot;I've told you many times I must not and will not tamper withyour mind in any way, Trevize. You beat down the temptation, I imagine,through your strong sense of duty.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I rather think not.&quot; He smiled wryly. &quot;Nothing so dramatic andnoble. My resistance was strengthened, for one thing, by the fact thatis was cold, and for another, by the sad thought that it wouldn't takemany sessions with her to kill me. I could never keep up the pace.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Well, anyway, you are safely aboard. What are we goingto do next?&quot;<br />
&quot;In the immediate future, we are going to move outward throughthe planetary system at a brisk pace until we are far enough fromComporellon's sun to make a Jump.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you think we will be stopped or followed?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I really think that the Minister is anxious only that we go awayas rapidly as possible and stay away, in order that the vengeance of HeWho Punishes not fall upon the planet. In fact &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;She believes the vengeance will surely fall on us. She is underthe firm conviction that we will never return. This, I hasten to add,is not an estimate of my probable level of infidelity, which she has hadno occasion to measure. She meant that Earth is so terrible a bearer ofmisfortune that anyone who seeks it must die in the process.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;How many have left Comporellon in search of Earth thatshe can make such a statement?&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt that any Comporellian has ever left on such a search. I toldher that her fears were mere superstition.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you believe that, or have you let hershake you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I know her fears are the purest superstition in the form she expressesthem, but they may be well founded just the same.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean, radioactivity will kill us if we try to land on it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't believe that Earth is radioactive. What I do believe is thatEarth protects itself. Remember that all reference to Earth in the Libraryon Trantor has been removed. Remember that Gaia's marvelous memory, inwhich all the planet takes part down to the rock strata of the surfaceand the molten metal at the core, stops short of penetrating far enoughback to tell us anything of Earth.<br />
  Clearly, if Earth is powerful enough to do that, it might also becapable of adjusting minds in order to force belief in its radioactivity,and thus preventing any search for it. Perhaps because Comporellon isso close that it represents a particular danger to Earth, there is thefurther reinforcement of a curious blankness. Deniador, who is a Skepticand a scientist, is utterly convinced that there is no use searching forEarth. He says it cannot be found. And that is why the Minister'ssuperstition may be well founded. If Earth is so intent on concealingitself, might it not kill us, or distort us, rather than allow us tofind it?Bliss frowned and said, &quot;Gaia &quot;Trevize said quickly, &quot;Don't say Gaia will protect us. Since Earthwas able to remove Gaia's earliest memories, it is clear that in anyconflict between the two Earth will win.&quot;Bliss said coldly, &quot;How do you know that the memories were removed? Itmight be that it simply took time for Gaia to develop a planetary memoryand that we can now probe backward only to the time of the completionof that development. And if the memory was removed, howcan you be sure that it was Earth that did it?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I don't know. I merely advance my speculations.&quot;Pelorat put in, rather timidly, &quot;If Earth is so powerful, and so intenton preserving its privacy, so to speak, of what use is our search? Youseem to think Earth won't allow us to succeed and will kill us if thatwill be what it takes to keep us from succeeding. In that case, is thereany sense in not abandoning this whole thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;It might seem we ought to give up, I admit, but I have this powerfulconviction that Earth exists, and I must and will find it. And Gaiatells me that when I have powerful convictions of this sort, I am alwaysright.&quot;<br />
&quot;But how can we survive the discovery, old chap?&quot;<br />
&quot;It may be,&quot; said Trevize, with an effort at lightness, &quot;that Earth,too, will recognize the value of my extraordinary rightness and will leaveme to myself. But  and this is what I am finally gettingat I cannot be certain that you two will survive and that is ofconcern to me. It always has been, but it is increasing now and it seemsto me that I ought to take you two back to Gaia and then proceed on myown. It is I, not you, who first decided I must search for Earth; it is I,not you, who see value in it; it is I, not you, who am driven. Let it beI, then, not you, who take the risk. Let me go on alone. Janov?&quot;Pelorat's long face seemed to grow longer as he buried his chin inhis neck. &quot;I won't deny I feel nervous, Golan, but I'd be ashamed toabandon you. I would disown myself if I did so.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;Gaia will not abandon you, Trevize, whatever you do. If Earth shouldprove dangerous, Gaia will protect you as far as it can. And in any case,in my role as Bliss, I will not abandon Pel, and if he clings to you,then I certainly cling to him.&quot;Trevize said grimly, &quot;Very well, then. I've given you your chance. Wego on together.&quot;<br />
&quot;Together,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  Pelorat smiled slightly, and gripped Trevize'sshoulder. &quot;Together. Always.&quot;29Bliss said, &quot;Look at that, Pel.&quot;She had been making use of the ship's telescope by hand, almostaimlessly, as a change from Pelorat's library of Earth-legendry.<br />
  Pelorat approached, placed an arm about her shoulders and looked atthe viewscreen. One of the gas giants of the Comporellian planetary systemwas in sight, magnified till it seemed the large body it really was.<br />
  In color it was a soft orange streaked with paler stripes. Viewedfrom the planetary plane, and more distant from the sun than the shipitself was, it was almost a complete circle of light.<br />
  Beautiful, said Pelorat.<br />
  The central streak extends beyond the planet, Pel.Pelorat furrowed his brow and said, &quot;You know, Bliss, I believeit does.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you suppose it's an optical illusion?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I'm not sure, Bliss. I'm as much a space-novice asyou are Golan!&quot;Trevize answered the call with a rather feeble &quot;What is it?&quot; andentered the pilot-room, looking a bit rumpled, as though he had just beennapping on his bed with his clothes on which was exactly what hehad been doing.<br />
  He said, in a rather peevish way, &quot;Please! Don't be handling theinstruments.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's just the telescope,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Look at that.&quot;Trevize did. &quot;It's a gas giant, the one they call Gallia, accordingto the information I was given.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can you tell it's that one, just looking?&quot;<br />
&quot;For one thing,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;at our distance from the sun, andbecause of the planetary sizes and orbital positions, which I've beenstudying in plotting our course, that's the only one you could magnifyto that extent at this time. For another thing, there's the ring.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ring?&quot; said Bliss, mystified.<br />
  All you can see is a thin, pale marking, because we're viewing italmost edge-on. We can zoom up out of the planetary plane and give youa better view. Would you like that?Pelorat said, &quot;I don't want to make you have to recalculate positionsand courses, Golan. &quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well, the computer will do it for me with little trouble.&quot; He satdown at the computer as he spoke and placed his hands on the markings thatreceived them. The computer, finely attuned to his mind, did the rest.<br />
  The Far Star , free of fuel problems or of inertial sensations,accelerated rapidly, and once again, Trevize felt a surge of love for acomputer-and-ship that responded in such a way to him as thoughit was his thought that powered and directed it, as though it were apowerful and obedient extension of his will.<br />
  It was no wonder the Foundation wanted it back; no wonder Comporellonhad wanted it for itself. The only surprise was that the force ofsuperstition had been strong enough to cause Comporellon to be willingto give it up.<br />
  Properly armed, it could outrun or outfight any ship in the Galaxy,or any combination of ships provided only that it did not encounteranother ship like itself.<br />
  Of course, it was not properly armed. Mayor Branno, in assigning himthe ship, had at least been cautious enough to leave it unarmed.<br />
  Pelorat and Bliss watched intently as the planet, Gallia, slowly,slowly, tipped toward them. The upper pole (whichever it was) becamevisible, with turbulence in a large circular region around it, whilethe lower pole retired behind the bulge of the sphere.<br />
  At the upper end, the dark side of the planet invaded the sphere oforange light, and the beautiful circle became increasingly lopsided.<br />
  What seemed more exciting was that the central pale streak was nolonger straight but had come to be curved, as were the other streaks tothe north and south, but more noticeably so.<br />
  Now the central streak extended beyond the edges of the planet verydistinctly and did so in a narrow loop on either side. There was noquestion of illusion; its nature was apparent. It was a ring of matter,looping about the planet, and hidden on the far side.<br />
  That's enough to give you the idea, I think, said Trevize. &quot;If wewere to move over the planet, you would see the ring in its circularform, concentric about the planet, touching it nowhere. You'll probablysee that it's not one ring either but several concentric rings.&quot;<br />
&quot;I wouldn't have thought it possible,&quot; said Pelorat blankly. &quot;Whatkeeps it in space?&quot;<br />
&quot;The same thing that keeps a satellite in space,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Therings consist of tiny particles, every one of which is orbiting theplanet. The rings are so close to the planet that tidal effects preventit from coalescing into a single body.&quot;Pelorat shook his head. &quot;It's horrifying when I think of it, oldman. How is it possible that I can have spent my whole life as a scholarand yet know so little about astronomy?&quot;<br />
&quot;And I know nothing at all about the myths of humanity. No one canencompass all of knowledge. The point is that these planetaryrings aren't unusual. Almost every single gas giant has them, even ifit's only a thin curve of dust. As it happens, the sun of Terminus has notrue gas giant in its planetary family, so unless a Terminian is a spacetraveler, or has taken University instruction in astronomy, he's likelyto know nothing about planetary rings. What is unusual is a ring thatis sufficiently broad to be bright and noticeable, like that one. It'sbeautiful. It must be a couple of hundred kilometers wide, at least.&quot;At this point, Pelorat snapped his fingers. &quot; That's what it meant.&quot;Bliss looked startled. &quot;What is it, Pel?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I came across a scrap of poetry once, very ancient,and in an archaic version of Galactic that was hard to make out but thatwas good evidence of great age. Though I shouldn't complain of thearchaism, old chap. My work has made me an expert on various varietiesof Old Galactic, which is quite gratifying even if it is of no use tome whatever outside my work. What was I talking about?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;An old scrap of poetry, Pel dear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, Bliss,&quot; he said. And to Trevize, &quot;She keeps close trackof what I say in order to pull me back whenever I get off-course, whichis most of the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's part of your charm, Pel,&quot; said Bliss, smiling.<br />
  Anyway, this scrap of poetry purported to describe the planetarysystem of which Earth was part. Why it should do so, I don't know,for the poem as a whole does not survive; at least, I was never ableto locate it. Only this one portion survived, perhaps because of itsastronomical content. In any case, it spoke of the brilliant triplering of the sixth planet `both brade and large, sae the woruld shronk incomparisoun.' I can still quote it, you see. I didn't understand what aplanet's ring could be. I remember thinking of three circles on one sideof the planet, all in a row. It seemed so nonsensical, I didn't botherto include it in my library. I'm sorry now I didn't inquire. He shookhis head. &quot;Being a mythologist in today's Galaxy is so solitary a job,one forgets the good of inquiring.&quot;Trevize said consolingly, &quot;You were probably right to ignore it,Janov. It's a mistake to take poetic chatter literally.&quot;<br />
&quot;But that's what was meant,&quot; said Pelorat, pointing at thescreen. &quot;That's what the poem was speaking of. Three wide rings,concentric, wider than the planet itself.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I never heard of such a thing. I don't think ringscan be that wide. Compared to the planet they circle, they are alwaysvery narrow.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;We never heard of a habitable planet with a giantsatellite, either. Or one with a radioactive crust. This is uniquenessnumber three. If we find a radioactive planet that might be otherwisehabitable, with a giant satellite, and with another planet in thesystem that has a huge ring, there would be no doubt at all that we hadencountered Earth.&quot;Trevize smiled. &quot;I agree, Janov. If we find all three, we willcertainly have found Earth.&quot;<br />
&quot;If!&quot; said Bliss, with a sigh.<br />
  30They were beyond the main worlds of the planetarysystem, plunging outward between the positions of the two outermostplanets so that there was now no significant mass within 1.5 billionkilometers. Ahead lay only the vast cometary cloud which, gravitationally,was insignificant.<br />
  The Far Star had accelerated to a speed of 0.1 c , onetenth the speed of light. Trevize knew well that, in theory, the shipcould be accelerated to nearly the speed of light, but he also knew that,in practice, 0.1 c was the reasonable limit.<br />
  At that speed, any object with appreciable mass could be avoided,but there was no way of dodging the innumerable dust particles in space,and, to a far greater extent even, individual atoms and molecules. Atvery fast speeds, even such small objects could do damage, scouring andscraping the ship's hull. At speeds near the speed of light, each atomsmashing into the hull had the properties of a cosmic ray particle. Underthat penetrating cosmic radiation, anyone on board ship would not longsurvive.<br />
  The distant stars showed no perceptible motion in the viewscreen,and even though the ship was moving at thirty thousand kilometers persecond, there was every appearance of its standing still.<br />
  The computer scanned space to great distances for any oncoming objectof small but significant size that might be on a collision course, andthe ship veered gently to avoid it, in the extremely unlikely case thatthat would be necessary. Between the small size of any possible oncomingobject, the speed with which it was passed, and the lack of inertialeffect as the result of the course change, there was no way of tellingwhether anything ever took place in the nature of what might be termed a&quot;close call.&quot;Trevize, therefore, did not worry about such things, or even giveit the most casual thought. He kept his full attention on the threesets of co-ordinates he had been given by Deniador, and, particularly,on the set which indicated the object closest to themselves.<br />
  Is there something wrong with the figures? asked Peloratanxiously.<br />
  I can't tell yet, said Trevize. &quot;Co-ordinates in themselves aren'tuseful, unless you know the zero point and the conventions used insetting them up the direction in which to mark off the distance,so to speak, what the equivalent of a prime meridian is, and so on.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you find out such things?&quot; said Pelorat blankly.<br />
  I obtained the co-ordinates of Terminus and a few other knownpoints, relative to Comporellon. If I put them into the computer,it will calculate what the conventions must be for such co-ordinatesif Terminus and the other points are to be correctly located. I'm onlytrying to organize things in my mind so that I can properly program thecomputer for this. Once the conventions are determined, the figures wehave for the Forbidden Worlds might possibly have meaning.&quot;Only possibly? said Bliss.<br />
  Only possibly, I'm afraid, said Trevize. &quot;These are old figuresafter all presumably Comporellian, but not definitely. What ifthey are based on other conventions?&quot;<br />
&quot;In that case?&quot;<br />
&quot;In that case, we have only meaningless figures. But we justhave to find out.&quot;His hands flickered over the softly glowing keys of the computer,feeding it the necessary information. He then placed his hands onthe handmarks on the desk. He waited while the computer worked out theconventions of the known co-ordinates, paused a moment, then interpretedthe co-ordinates of the nearest Forbidden World by the same conventions,and finally located those co-ordinates on the Galactic map in itsmemory.<br />
  A starfield appeared on the screen and moved rapidly as it adjusteditself. When it reached stasis, it expanded with stars bleeding off theedges in all directions until they were almost all gone. At no pointcould the eye follow the rapid change; it was all a speckled blur. Untilfinally, a space one tenth of a parsec on each side (according to theindex figures below the screen) was all that remained. There was nofurther change, and only half a dozen dial sparks relieved the darknessof the screen.<br />
  Which one is the Forbidden World? asked Pelorat softly.<br />
  None of them, said Trevize. &quot;Four of them are red dwarfs, one anear-red dwarf, and the last a white dwarf. None of them can possiblyhave a habitable world in orbit about them.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know they're red dwarfs just by looking at them?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;We're not looking at real stars; we're looking at asection of the Galactic map stored in the computer's memory. Each oneis labeled. You can't see it and ordinarily I couldn't see it either,but as long as my hands are making contact, as they are, I am aware of aconsiderable amount of data on any star on which my eyes concentrate.&quot;Pelorat said in a woebegone tone, &quot;Then the co-ordinates areuseless.&quot;Trevize looked up at him, &quot;No, Janov. I'm not finished. There'sstill the matter of time. The co-ordinates for the Forbidden Worldare those of twenty thousand years ago. In that time, both it andComporellon have been revolving about the Galactic Center, and theymay well be revolving at different speeds and in orbits of differentinclinations and eccentricities. With time, therefore, the two worldsmay be drifting closer together or farther apart and, in twenty thousandyears, the Forbidden World may have drifted anywhere from one-half tofive parsecs off the mark. It certainly wouldn't be included in thattenth-parsec square.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do we do, then?&quot;<br />
&quot;We have the computer move the Galaxy twenty thousand years back intime relative to Comporellon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can it do that?&quot; asked Bliss, sounding rather awe-struck.<br />
  Well, it can't move the Galaxy itself back in time, but it can movethe map in its memory banks back in time.Bliss said, &quot;Will we see anything happen?&quot;<br />
&quot;Watch,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  Very slowly, the half-dozen stars crawled over the face of thescreen. A new star, not hitherto on the screen, drifted in from the lefthand edge, and Pelorat pointed in excitement. &quot;There! There!&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Sorry. Another red dwarf. They're very common. Atleast three fourths of all the stars in the Galaxy are red dwarfs.&quot;The screen settled down and stopped moving.<br />
  Well? said Bliss.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;That's it. That's the view of that portion of theGalaxy as it would have been twenty thousand years ago. At the verycenter of the screen is a point where the Forbidden World ought to beif it had been drifting at some average velocity.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ought to be, but isn't,&quot; said Bliss sharply.<br />
  It isn't, agreed Trevize, with remarkably little emotion.<br />
  Pelorat released his breath in a long sigh. &quot;Oh, too bad, Golan.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Wait, don't despair. I wasn't expecting to see thestar there.&quot;<br />
&quot;You weren't?&quot; said Pelorat, astonished.<br />
  No. I told you that this isn't the Galaxy itself, but the computer'smap of the Galaxy. If a real star is not included in the map, we don'tsee it. If the planet is called `Forbidden' and has been called so fortwenty thousand years, the chances are it wouldn't be included in themap. And it isn't, for we don't see it.Bliss said, &quot;We might not see it because it doesn't exist. TheComporellian legends may be false, or the co-ordinates may be wrong.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very true. The computer, however, can now make an estimate as towhat the co-ordinates ought to be at this time, now that it has locatedthe spot where it may have been twenty thousand years ago. Using theco-ordinates corrected for time, a correction I could only have madethrough use of the star map, we can now switch to the real starfield ofthe Galaxy itself.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;But you only assumed an average velocity for the ForbiddenWorld. What if its velocity was not average? You would not now have thecorrect co-ordinates.&quot;<br />
&quot;True enough, but a correction, assuming average velocity, is almostcertain to be closer to its real position, than if we had made no timecorrection at all.&quot;<br />
&quot;You hope!&quot; said Bliss doubtfully.<br />
  That's exactly what I do, said Trevize. &quot;I hope. And nowlet's look at the real Galaxy.&quot;The two onlookers watched tensely, while Trevize (perhaps to reducehis own tensions and delay the zero moment) spoke softly, almost asthough he were lecturing.<br />
  It's more difficult to observe the real Galaxy, he said. &quot;The map inthe computer is an artificial construction, with irrelevancies capable ofbeing eliminated. If there is a nebula obscuring the view, I can removeit. If the angle of view is inconvenient for what I have in mind, I canchange the angle, and so on. The real Galaxy, however, I must take asI find it, and if I want a change I must move physically through space,which will take far more time than it would take to adjust a map.&quot;And as he spoke, the screen showed a star cloud so rich in individualstars as to seem an irregular heap of powder.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;That's a large angle view of a section of the MilkyWay, and I want the foreground, of course. If I expand the foreground,the background will tend to fade in comparison. The co-ordinate spotis close enough to Comporellon so that I should be able to expand itto about the situation I had on the view of the map. Just let me putin the necessary instructions, if I can hold on to my sanity longenough. Now .&quot;The starfield expanded with a rush so that thousands of stars pushedoff every edge, giving the watchers so real a sensation of moving towardthe screen that all three automatically leaned backward as though inresponse to a forward rush.<br />
  The old view returned, not quite as dark as it had been on the map,but with the half-dozen stars shown as they had been in the originalview. And there, close to the center, was another star, shining far morebrightly than the others.<br />
  There it is, said Pelorat, in an awed whisper.<br />
  It may be. I'll have the computer take its spectrum and analyzeit. There was a moderately long pause, then Trevize said, &quot;Spectralclass, G-4, which makes it a trifle dimmer and smaller than Terminus'ssun, but rather brighter than Comporellon's sun. And no G-class starshould be omitted from the computer's Galactic map. Since this one is,that is a strong indication that it may be the sun about which theForbidden World revolves.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Is there any chance of its turning out that there is nohabitable planet revolving about this star after all?&quot;<br />
&quot;There's a chance, I suppose. In that case, we'll try to find theother two Forbidden Worlds.&quot;Bliss persevered. &quot;And if the other two are false alarms, too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Then we'll try something else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; said Trevize grimly.<br />
  Part Three - Aurora Chapter 8: Forbidden World<br />
  31&quot;Golan,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Does it bother you if I watch?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all, Janov,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  If I ask questions?&quot;Go ahead.Pelorat said, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;Trevize took his eyes off the viewscreen. &quot;I've got to measure thedistance of each star that seems to be near the Forbidden World onthe screen, so that I can determine how near they really are. Theirgravitational fields must be known and for that I need mass anddistance. Without that knowledge, one can't be sure of a clean Jump.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you do that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, each star I see has its co-ordinates in the computer's memorybanks and these can be converted into co-ordinates on the Comporelliansystem. That can, in turn, be slightly corrected for the actual positionof the For Star in space relative to Comporellon's sun, and that givesme the distance of each. Those red dwarfs all look quite near theForbidden World on the screen, but some might be much closer and somemuch farther. We need their three-dimensional position, you see.&quot;Pelorat nodded, and said, &quot;And you already have the co-ordinates ofthe Forbidden World &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but that's not enough. I need the distances of the otherstars to within a percent or so. Their gravitational intensity in theneighborhood of the Forbidden World is so small that a slight errormakes no perceptible difference. The sun about which the Forbidden Worldrevolves or might revolve possessss an enormously intensegravitational field in the neighborhood of the Forbidden World and Imust know its distance with perhaps a thousand times the accuracy ofthat of the other stars. The co-ordinatss alone won't do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what do you do?&quot;<br />
&quot;I measure the apparent separation of the Forbidden World or,rather, its star from three nearby stars which are so dim it takesconsiderable magnification to make them out at all. Presumably, thosethree are very far away. We then keep one of those three stars centered onthe screen and Jump a tenth of a parsec in a direction at right angles tothe line of vision to the Forbidden World. We can do that safely enougheven without knowing distances to comparatively far-off stars.<br />
  The reference star which is centered would still be centered afterthe Jump. The two other dim stars, if all three are truly very distant,do not change their positions measurably. The Forbidden World, however,is close enough to change its apparent position in parallactic shift. Fromthe size of the shift, we can determine its distance. If I want to makedoubly certain, I choose three other stars and try again.Pelorat said, &quot;How long doss all that take?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not very long. The computer doss the heavy work. I just tell it whatto do. What really takes the time is that I have to study the resultsand make sure they look right and that my instructions aren't at faultsomehow. If I were one of those daredevils with utter faith in themselvesand the computer, it could all be done in a few minutes.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;It's really astonishing. Think how much the computerdoes for us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think of it all the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;What would you do without it?&quot;<br />
&quot;What would I do without a gravitic ship? What would I do withoutmy astronautic training? What would I do without twenty thousandyears of hyperspatial technology behind me? The fact is that I'mmyself here now. Suppose weeeere to imagine ourselves twentythousand additional years into the future. What technological marvelswould we have to be grateful for? Or might it be that twenty thousandyears hence humanity would not exist?&quot;<br />
&quot;Scarcely that,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Scarcely not exist. Even if wedon't become part of Galaxia, we would still have psychohistory toguide us.&quot;Trevize turned in his chair, releasing his handhold on thecomputer. &quot;Let it work out distances,&quot; he said, &quot;and let it check thematter a number of times. There's no hurry.&quot;He looked quizzically at Pelorat, and said, &quot;Psychohistory! You know,Janov, twice that subject came up on Comporellon, and twice it wasdescribed as a superstition. I said so once, and then Deniador said italso. After all, how can you define psychohistory but as a superstitionof the Foundation? Isn't it a belief without proof or evidence? What doyou think, Janov? It's more your field than mine.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Why do you say there's no evidence, Golan? Thesimulacrum of Hari Seldon has appeared in the Time Vault many times andhas discussed events as they happened. He could not have known whatthose events would be, in his time, had he not been able to predictthem psychohistorically.&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;That sounds impressive. He was wrong about theMule, but even allowing for that, it's impressive. Still, it has anuncomfortable magical feel to it. Any conjurer can do tricks.&quot;<br />
&quot;No conjurer could predict centuries into the future.&quot;<br />
&quot;No conjurer could really do what he makes you think he does.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come, Golan. I can't think of any trick that would allow me topredict what will happen five centuries from now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nor can you think of a trick that will allow a conjurer to readthe contents of a message hidden in a pseudo-tesseract on an unmannedorbiting satellite. Just the same, I've seen a conjurer do it. Has itever occurred to you that the Time Capsule, along with the Hari Seldonsimulacrum, may be rigged by the government?&quot;Pelorat looked as though he were revolted by the suggestion. &quot;Theywouldn't do that.&quot;Trevize made a scornful sound.<br />
  Pelorat said, &quot;And they'd be caught if they tried.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not at all sure of that. The point is, though, that we don'tknow how psychohistory works at all.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know how that computer works, but I know it works.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's because others know how it works. How would it be if noone knew how it worked? Then, if it stopped working for any reason, wewould be helpless to do anything about it. And if psychohistory suddenlystopped working &quot;<br />
&quot;The Second Foundationers know the workings of psychohistory.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know that, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;So it is said.&quot;<br />
&quot;Anything can be said. Ah, we have the distance of theForbidden World's star, and, I hope, very accurately. Let's considerthe figures.&quot;He stared at them for a long time, his lips moving occasionally,as though he were doing some rough calculations in his head. Finally,he said, without lifting his eyes, &quot;What's Bliss doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sleeping, old chap,&quot; said Pelorat. Then, defensively, &quot;Sheneeds sleep, Golan. Maintaining herself as part of Gaiaacross hyperspace is energy-consuming.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose so,&quot; said Trevize, and turned back to the computer. Heplaced his hands on the desk and muttered, &quot;I'll let it go in severalJumps and have it recheck each time.&quot; Then he withdrew them againand said, &quot;I'm serious, Janov. What do you know aboutpsychohistory?&quot;Pelorat looked taken aback. &quot;Nothing. Being a historian,which I am, after a fashion, is worlds different from being apsychohistorian. Of course, I know the two fundamental basics ofpsychohistory, but everyone knows that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Even I do. The first requirement is that the number of human beingsinvolved must be large enough to make statistical treatment valid. Buthow large is `large enough'?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;The latest estimate of the Galactic populationis something like ten quadrillion, and that's probably anunderestimate. Surely, that's large enough.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because psychohistory does work, Golan. No matter howyou chop logic, it does work.&quot;<br />
&quot;And the second requirement,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;is that human beingsnot be aware of psychohistory, so that the knowledge does not skew theirreactions. But they are aware of psychohistory.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only of its bare existence, old chap. That's not whatcounts. The second requirement is that human beings not be awareof the predictions of psychohistory and that they arenot except that the Second Foundationers are supposed to be awareof them, but they're a special case.&quot;<br />
&quot;And upon those two requirements alone , the science ofpsychohistory has been developed. That's hard to believe.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not out of those two requirements alone, &quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Thereare advanced mathematics and elaborate statistical methods. Thestory is if you want tradition that Hari Seldon devisedpsychohistory by modeling it upon the kinetic theory of gases. Each atomor molecule in a gas moves randomly so that we can't know the position orvelocity of any one of them. Nevertheless, using statistics, we can workout the rules governing their overall behavior with great precision. Inthe same way, Seldon intended to work out the overall behavior of humansocieties even though the solutions would not apply to the behavior ofindividual human beings.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but human beings aren't atoms.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;A human being has consciousness and his behavioris sufficiently complicated to make it appear to be free will. How Seldonhandled that I haven't any idea, and I'm sure I couldn't understandit even if someone who knew tried to explain it to me but hedid it.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;And the whole thing depends on dealing with people whoare both numerous and unaware. Doesn't that seem to you a quicksandishfoundation on which to build an enormous mathematical structure? Ifthose requirements are not truly met, then everything collapses.&quot;<br />
&quot;But since the Plan hasn't collapsed &quot;<br />
&quot;Or, if the requirements are not exactly false or inadequate butsimply weaker than they should be, psychohistory might work adequatelyfor centuries and then, upon reaching some particular crisis, wouldcollapse as it did temporarily in the time of the Mule. Orwhat if there is a third requirement?&quot;<br />
&quot;What third requirement?&quot; asked Pelorat, frowning slightly.<br />
  I don't know, said Trevize. &quot;An argument may seem thoroughlylogical and elegant and yet contain unexpressed assumptions. Maybe thethird requirement is an assumption so taken for granted that no one everthinks of mentioning it.&quot;<br />
&quot;An assumption that is so taken for granted is usually valid enough,or it wouldn't be so taken for granted.&quot;Trevize snorted. &quot;If you knew scientific history as well as you knowtraditional history, Janov, you would know how wrong that is. ButI see that we are now in the neighborhood of the sun of the ForbiddenWorld.&quot;And, indeed, centered on the screen, was a bright star one sobright that the screen automatically filtered its light to the pointwhere all other stars were washed out.<br />
  32Facilities for washing and for personal hygiene on boardthe Far Star were compact, and the use of water was always held to areasonable minimum to avoid overloading the recycling facilities. BothPelorat and Bliss had been sternly reminded of this by Trevize.<br />
  Even so, Bliss maintained an air of freshness at all times and herdark, long hair could be counted on to be glossy, her fingernails tosparkle.<br />
  She walked into the pilot-room and said, &quot;There you are!&quot;Trevize looked up and said, &quot;No need for surprise. We could scarcelyhave left the ship, and a thirty-second search would be bound touncover us inside the ship, even if you couldn't detect our presencementally.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;The expression was purely a form of greeting and notmeant to be taken literally, as you well know. Where are we? Anddon't say, `In the pilot-room.'&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss dear,&quot; said Pelorat, holding out one arm, &quot;we're at the outerregions of the planetary system of the nearest of the three ForbiddenWorlds.&quot;She walked to his side, placing her hand lightly on his shoulder,while his arm moved about her waist. She said, &quot;It can't be veryForbidden. Nothing has stopped us.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;It is only Forbidden because Comporellon and the otherworlds of the second wave of settlement have voluntarily placed the worldsof the first wave the Spacers out of bounds. If we ourselvesdon't feel bound by that voluntary agreement, what is to stop us?&quot;<br />
&quot;The Spacers, if any are left, might have voluntarily placed theworlds of the second wave out of bounds, too. Just because we don't mindintruding upon them doesn't mean that they don't mind it.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;If they exist. But so far we don't even knowif any planet exists for them to live on. So far, all we see are theusual gas giants. Two of them, and not particularly large ones.&quot;Pelorat said hastily, &quot;But that doesn't mean the Spacer worlddoesn't exist. Any habitable world would be much closer to the sunand much smaller and very hard to detect in the solar glare from thisdistance. We'll have to micro-Jump inward to detect such a planet.&quot; Heseemed rather proud to be speaking like a seasoned space traveler.<br />
  In that case, said Bliss, &quot;why aren't we moving inward?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not just yet,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I'm having the computer check as faras it can for any sign of an artificial structure. We'll move inwardby stages a dozen, if necessary checking at each stage. Idon't want to be trapped this time as we were when we first approachedGaia. Remember, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;Traps like that could catch us every day. The one at Gaia broughtme Bliss.&quot; Pelorat gazed at her fondly.<br />
  Trevize grinned. &quot;Are you hoping for a new Bliss every day?&quot;Pelorat looked hurt, and Bliss said, with a trace of annoyance,&quot;My good chap or whatever it is that Pel insists on callingyou you might as well move in more quickly. While I am with you,you will not be trapped.&quot;<br />
&quot;The power of Gaia?&quot;<br />
&quot;To detect the presence of other minds? Certainly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you are strong enough, Bliss? I gather you must sleepquite a bit to regain strength expended at maintaining contact with themain body of Gaia. How far can I rely on the perhaps narrow limits ofyour abilities at this distance from the source?&quot;Bliss flushed. &quot;The strength of the connection is ample.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Don't be offended. I'm simply asking. Don't yousee this as a disadvantage of being Gaia? I am not Gaia. I am a completeand independent individual. That means I can travel as far as I wish frommy world and my people, and remain Golan Trevize. What powers I have,and such as they are, I continue to have, and they remain whereverI go. If I were alone in space, parsecs away from any human being,and unable, for some reason, to communicate with anyone in any way,or even to see the spark of a single star in the sky, I would be andremain Golan Trevize. I might not be able to survive, and I might die,but I would die Golan Trevize.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Alone in space and far from all others, you would beunable to call on the help of your fellows, on their different talentsand knowledge. Alone, as an isolated individual, you would be sadlydiminished as compared with youself as part of an integrated society. Youknow that.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;There would nevertheless not be the same diminution asin your case. There is a bond between you and Gaia that is far strongerthan the one between me and my society, and that bond stretches throughhyperspace and requires energy for maintenance, so that you must gasp,mentally, with the effort, and feel yourself to be a diminished entityfar more than I must.&quot;Bliss's young face set hard and, for a moment, she looked young nomore or, rather, she appeared ageless more Gaia than Bliss, asthough to refute Trevize's contention. She said, &quot;Even if everything yousay is so, Golan Trevize that is, was, and will be, that cannotperhaps be less, but certainly cannot be more even if everythingyou say is so, do you expect there is no price to be paid for a benefitgained? Is it not better to be a warm-blooded creature such as yourselfthan a cold-blooded creature such as a fish, or whatever?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Tortoises are cold-blooded. Terminus doesn't have any,but some worlds do. They are shelled creatures, very slow-moving butlong-living.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, then, isn't it better to be a human being than a tortoise; tomove quickly whatever the temperature, rather than slowly? Isn't it betterto support high-energy activities, quickly contracting muscles, quicklyworking nerve fibers, intense and long-sustained thought than tocreep slowly, and sense gradually, and have only a blurred awareness ofthe immediate surroundings? Isn't it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Granted,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It is. What of it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, don't you know you must pay for warm-bloodedness? To maintainyour temperature above that of your surroundings, you must expend energyfar more wastefully than a tortoise must. You must be eating almostconstantly so that you can pour energy into your body as quickly as itleaks out. You would starve far more quickly than a tortoise would,and die more quickly, too. Would you rather be a tortoise, and livemore slowly and longer? Or would you rather pay the price and be aquick-moving, quick-sensing, thinking organism?&quot;<br />
&quot;Is this a true analogy, Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Trevize, for the situation with Gaia is more favorable. We don'texpend unusual quantities of energy when we are compactly together. It isonly when part of Gaia is at hyperspatial distances from the rest of Gaiathat energy expenditure rises. And remember that what you have votedfor is not merely a larger Gaia, not just a larger individual world. Youhave decided for Galaxia, for a vast complex of worlds. Anywhere in theGalaxy, you will be part of Galaxia and you will be closely surroundedby parts of something that extends from each interstellar atom to thecentral black hole. It would then require small amounts of energy toremain a whole. No part would be at any great distance from all otherparts. It is all this you have decided for, Trevize. How can you doubtthat you have chosen well?&quot;Trevize's head was bent in thought. Finally, he looked up and said,&quot;I may have chosen well, but I must be convinced of that. Thedecision I have made it the most important in the history of humanityand it is not enough that it be a good one. I must know it to be a good one.&quot;<br />
&quot;What more do you need than what I have told you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know, but I will find it on Earth.&quot; He spoke with absoluteconviction.<br />
  Pelorat said, &quot;Golan, the star shows a disc.&quot;It did. The computer, busy about its own affairs and not the leastconcerned with any discussion that might swirl about it, had beenapproaching the star in stages, and had reached the distance Trevizehad set for it.<br />
  They continued to be well outside the planetary plane and the computersplit the screen to show each of three small inner planets.<br />
  It was the innermost that had a surface temperature in the liquid-waterrange, and that had an oxygen atmosphere as well. Trevize waited for itsorbit to be computed and the first crude estimate seemed reasonable. Hekept that computation going, for the longer the planetary movement wasobserved, the more accurate the computation of its orbital elements.<br />
  Trevize said quite calmly, &quot;We have a habitable planet in view. Verylikely habitable.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; Pelorat looked as nearly delighted as his solemn expressionwould allow.<br />
  I'm afraid, though, said Trevize, &quot;that there's no giantsatellite. In fact, no satellite of any kind has been detected so far. Soit isn't Earth. At least, not if we go by tradition.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't worry about that, Golan.&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;I rather suspectedwe weren't going to encounter Earth here when I saw that neither of thegas giants had an unusual ring system.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very well, then,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;The next step is to find out thenature of the life inhabiting it. From the fact that it has an oxygenatmosphere, we can be absolutely certain that there is plant life uponit, but &quot;<br />
&quot;Animal life, too,&quot; said Bliss abruptly. &quot;And in quantity.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Trevize turned to her.<br />
  I can sense it. Only faintly at this distance, but the planet isunquestionably not only habitable, but inhabited.33The Far Star was in polar orbit about the Forbidden World,at a distance great enough to keep the orbital period at a little inexcess of six days. Trevize seemed in no hurry to come out of orbit.<br />
  Since the planet is inhabited, he explained, &quot;and since, according toDeniador, it was once inhabited by human beings who were technologicallyadvanced and who represent a first wave of Settlers the so-calledSpacers they may be technologically advanced still and may haveno great love for us of the second wave who have replaced them. I wouldlike them to show themselves, so that we can learn a little about thembefore risking a landing.&quot;<br />
&quot;They may not know we are here,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  We would, if the situation were reversed. I must assume, then, that,if they exist, they are likely to try to make contact withus. They might even want to come out and get us.&quot;But if they did come out after us and were technologically advanced,we might be helpless to &quot;I can't believe that, said Trevize. &quot;Technological advancement isnot necessarily all one piece. They might conceivably be far beyond us insome ways, but it's clear they don't indulge in interstellar travel. Itis we, not they, who have settled the Galaxy, and in all the history ofthe Empire, I know of nothing that would indicate that they left theirworlds and made themselves evident to us. If they haven't been spacetraveling, how could they be expected to have made serious advances inastronautics? And if they haven't, they can't possibly have anythinglike a gravitic ship. We may be essentially unarmed but even if theycome lumbering after us with a battleship, they couldn't possibly catchus. No, we wouldn't be helpless.&quot;<br />
&quot;Their advance may be in mentalics. It may be that the Mule was aSpacer &quot;Trevize shrugged in clear irritation. &quot;The Mule can't beeverything. The Gaians have described him as an aberrant Gaian. He'salso been considered a random mutant.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;To be sure, there have also been speculations nottaken very seriously, of course that he was a mechanical artifact. Arobot, in other words, though that word wasn't used.&quot;<br />
&quot;If there is something that seems mentally dangerous, we will haveto depend on Bliss to neutralize that. She can Is she asleep now,by the way?&quot;<br />
&quot;She has been,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;but she was stirring when I cameout here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Stirring, was she? Well, she'll have to be awake on short notice ifanything starts happening. You'll have to see to that, Janov.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, Golan,&quot; said Pelorat quietly.<br />
  Trevize shifted his attention to the computer. &quot;One thing that bothersme are the entry stations. Ordinarily, they are a sure sign of a planetinhabited by human beings with a high technology. But these &quot;<br />
&quot;Is there something wrong with them?&quot;<br />
&quot;Several things. In the first place, they're very archaic. Theymight be thousands of years old. In the second, there's no radiationbut thermals.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are thermals?&quot;<br />
&quot;Thermal radiation is given off by any object warmer than itssurroundings. It's a familiar signature that everything yields and itconsists of a broad band of radiation following a fixed pattern dependingon temperature. That is what the entry stations are radiating. If thereare working human devices aboard the stations, there is bound to bea leakage of nonthermal, nonrandom radiation. Since only thermals arepresent we can assume that either the stations are empty, and have been,perhaps, for thousands of years; or, if occupied, it is by people with atechnology so advanced in this direction that they leak no radiation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;the planet has a high civilization,but the entry stations are empty because the planet has been left sostrictly alone for so long by our kind of Settlers that they are nolonger concerned about any approach.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps. Or perhaps it is a lure of some sort.&quot;Bliss entered, and Trevize, noting her out of the corner of his eyes,said grumpily, &quot;Yes, here we are.&quot;<br />
&quot;So I see,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;and still in an unchanged orbit. I can tellthat much.&quot;Pelorat explained hastily. &quot;Golan is being cautious, dear. Theentry stations seem unoccupied and we're not sure of the significanceof that.&quot;<br />
&quot;There's no need to worry about it,&quot; said Bliss indifferently. &quot;Thereare no detectable signs of intelligent life on the planet we'reorbiting.&quot;Trevize bent an astonished glare at her. &quot;What are you talkingabout? You said &quot;<br />
&quot;I said there was animal life on the planet, and so there is, butwhere in the Galaxy were you taught that animal life necessarily implieshuman life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why didn't you say this when you first detected animal life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because at that distance, I couldn't tell. I could barely detectthe unmistakable wash of animal neural activity, but there was no wayI could, at that intensity, tell butterflies from human beings.&quot;<br />
&quot;And now?&quot;<br />
&quot;We're much closer now, and you may have thought I was asleep, but Iwasn't or, at least, only briefly. I was, to use an inappropriateword, listening as hard as I could for any sign of mental activitycomplex enough to signify the presence of intelligence.&quot;<br />
&quot;And there isn't any?&quot;<br />
&quot;I would suppose,&quot; said Bliss, with sudden caution, &quot;that if Idetect nothing at this distance, there can't possibly be more than a fewthousand human beings on the planet. If we come closer, I can judge itstill more delicately.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, that changes things,&quot; said Trevize, with some confusion.<br />
  I suppose, said Bliss, who looked distinctly sleepy and, therefore,irritable. &quot;You can now discard all this business of analyzingradiation and inferring and deducing and who knows what else you mayhave been doing. My Gaian senses do the job much more efficiently andsurely. Perhaps you see what I mean when I say it is better to be aGaian than an Isolate.&quot;Trevize waited before answering, clearly laboring to hold histemper. When he spoke, it was with a polite, and almost formal tone, &quot;Iam grateful to you for the information. Nevertheless, you must understandthat, to use an analogy, the thought of the advantage of improving mysense of smell would be insufficient motive for me to decide to abandonmy humanity and become a bloodhound.&quot;34They could see the Forbidden World now, as they movedbelow the cloud layer and drifted through the atmosphere. It lookedcuriously moth-eaten.<br />
  The polar regions were icy, as might be expected, but they were notlarge in extent. The mountainous regions were barren, with occasionalglaciers, but they were not large in extent, either. There were smalldesert areas, well scattered.<br />
  Putting all that aside, the planet was, in potential, beautiful. Itscontinental areas were quite large, but sinuous, so that there werelong shorelines, and rich coastal plains of generous extent. Therewere lush tracts of both tropical and temperate forests, rimmed bygrasslands and yet the moth-eaten nature of it all was evident.<br />
  Scattered through the forests were semibarren areas, and parts ofthe grasslands were thin and sparse.<br />
  Some sort of plant disease? said Pelorat wonderingly.<br />
  No, said Bliss slowly. &quot;Something worse than that, and morepermanent.&quot;<br />
&quot;I've seen a number of worlds,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but nothing likethis.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have seen very few worlds,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;but I think the thoughtsof Gaia and this is what you might expect of a world from which humanityhas disappeared.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  Think about it, said Bliss tartly. &quot;No inhabited world has a trueecological balance. Earth must have had one originally, for if thatwas the world on which humanity evolved, there must have been longages when humanity did not exist, or any species capable of developingan advanced technology and the ability to modify the environment. Inthat case, a natural balance everchanging, of course musthave existed. On all other inhabited worlds, however, human beings havecarefully terraformed their new environments and established plant andanimal life, but the ecological system they introduce is bound to beunbalanced. It would possess only a limited number of species and onlythose that human beings wanted, or couldn't help introducing &quot;Pelorat said, &quot;You know what that reminds me of? Pardon me,Bliss, for interrupting, but it so fits that I can't resist tellingyou right now before I forget. There's an old creation myth I once cameacross; a myth in which life was formed on a planet and consisted of onlya limited assortment of species, just those useful to or pleasant forhumanity. The first human beings then did something silly nevermind what, old fellow, because those old myths are usually symbolic andonly confusing if they are taken literally and the planet's soilwas cursed. `Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee,'<br />
  is the way the curse was quoted though the passage sounds much betterin the archaic Galactic in which it was written. The point is, though,was it really a curse? Things human beings don't like and don't want,such as thorns and thistles, may be needed to balance the ecology.&quot;Bliss smiled. &quot;It's really amazing, Pel, how everything reminds youof a legend, and how illuminating they are sometimes. Human beings, interraforming a world, leave out the thorns and thistles, whatever theymay be, and human beings then have to labor to keep the world going. Itisn't a self-supporting organism as Gaia is. It is rather a miscellaneouscollection of Isolates and the collection isn't miscellaneous enoughto allow the ecological balance to persist indefinitely. If humanitydisappears, and if its guiding hands are removed, the world's pattern oflife inevitably begins to fall apart. The planet unterraforms itself.&quot;Trevize said skeptically, &quot;If that's what's happening, it doesn'thappen quickly. This world may have been free of human beings for twentythousand years and yet most of it still seems to be very much a goingconcern.&quot;<br />
&quot;Surely,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;that depends on how well the ecological balancewas set up in the first place. If it is a fairly good balance to beginwith, it might last for a long time without human beings. After all,twenty thousand years, though very long in terms of human affairs,is just overnight when compared to a planetary lifetime.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Pelorat, staring intently at the planetary vista,&quot;that if the planet is degenerating, we can be sure that the human beingsare gone.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I still detect no mental activity at the human level andI am willing to suppose that the planet is safely free of humanity. Thereis the steady hum and buzz of lower levels of consciousness, however,levels high enough to represent birds and mammals. Just the same, I'mnot sure that unterraforming is enough to show human beings are gone. Aplanet might deteriorate even if human beings existed upon it, if thesociety were itself abnormal and did not understand the importance ofpreserving the environment.&quot;<br />
&quot;Surely,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;such a society would quickly be destroyed. Idon't think it would be possible for human beings to fail to understandthe importance of retaining the very factors that are keeping themalive.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I don't have your pleasant faith in human reason,Pel. It seems to me to be quite conceivable that when a planetarysociety consists only of Isolates, local and even individual concernsmight easily be allowed to overcome planetary concerns.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't think that's conceivable,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;anymore thanPelorat does. In fact, since human-occupied worlds exist by the millionand none of them have deteriorated in an unterraforming fashion, yourfear of Isolatism may be exaggerated, Bliss.&quot;The ship now moved out of the daylit hemisphere into the night. Theeffect was that of a rapidly deepening twilight, and then utter darknessoutside, except for starlight where the sky was clear.<br />
  The ship maintained its height by accurately monitoring the atmosphericpressure and gravitational intensity. They were at a height too greatto encounter any upthrusting mountainous massif, for the planet wasat a stage when mountain-building had not recently taken place. Still,the computer felt its way forward with its microwave finger-tips, justin case.<br />
  Trevize regarded the velvety darkness and said, thoughtfully,&quot;Somehow what I find most convincing as the sign of a deserted planet isthe absence of visible light on the dark side. No technological societycould possibly endure darkness. As soon as we get into the dayside,we'll go lower.&quot;<br />
&quot;What would be the use of that?&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;There's nothingthere.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who said there's nothing there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss did. And you did.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Janov. I said there's no radiation of technological origin andBliss said there's no sign of human mental activity, but that doesn'tmean there's nothing there. Even if there are no human beings on theplanet, there would surely be relics of some sort. I'm after information,Janov, and the remainders of a technology may have its uses in thatdirection.&quot;<br />
&quot;After twenty thousand years?&quot; Pelorat's voice climbed in pitch. &quot;Whatdo you think can survive twenty thousand years? There will be no films,no paper, no print; metal will have rusted, wood will have decayed,plastic will be in shattered grains. Even stone will have crumbledand eroded.&quot;<br />
&quot;It may not be twenty thousand years,&quot; said Trevize patiently. &quot;Imentioned that time as the longest period the planet may have beenleft empty of human beings because Comporellian legend has this worldflourishing at that time. But suppose the last human beings had died orvanished or fled only a thousand years ago.&quot;They arrived at the other end of the nightside and the dawn came andbrightened into sunlight almost instantaneously.<br />
  The Far Star sank downward and slowed its progress until thedetails of the land surface were clearly visible. The small islands thatdotted the continental shores could now be clearly seen. Most were greenwith vegetation.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;It's my idea that we ought to study the spoiledareas particularly. It seems to me that those places where human beingswere most concentrated would be where the ecological balance was mostlacking. Those areas might be the nucleus of the spreading blight ofunterraforming. What do you think, Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's possible. In any case, in the absence of definite knowledge,we might as well look where it's easiest to see. The grasslands andforest would have swallowed most signs of human habitation so thatlooking there might prove a waste of time.&quot;<br />
&quot;It strikes me,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that a world might eventuallyestablish a balance with what it has; that new species might develop;and that the bad areas might be recolonized on a new basis.&quot;<br />
&quot;Possibly, Pel,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;It depends on how badly out of balancethe world was in the first place. And for a world to heal itself andachieve a new balance through evolution would take far more than twentythousand years. We'd be talking millions of years.&quot;The Far Star was no longer circling the world. It was driftingslowly across a five-hundred-kilometer-wide stretch of scattered heathand furze, with occasional clumps of trees.<br />
  What do you think of that? said Trevize suddenly, pointing. Theship came to a drifting halt and hovered in mid-air. There was a low, butpersistent, hum as the gravitic engines shifted into high, neutralizingthe planetary gravitational field almost entirely.<br />
  There was nothing much to see where Trevize pointed. Tumbled moundsbearing soil and sparse grass were all that was visible.<br />
  It doesn't look like anything to me, said Pelorat.<br />
  There's a straight-line arrangement to that junk. Parallel lines,and you can make out some faint lines at right angles, too. See?      Youcan't get that in any natural formation. That's human architecture,marking out foundations and walls, just as clearly as though they werestill standing there to be looked at.&quot;Suppose it is, said Pelorat. &quot;That's just a ruin. If we'regoing to do archeological research, we're going to have to dig anddig. Professionals would take years to do it properly &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but we can't take the time to do it properly. That may bethe faint outline of an ancient city and something of it may still bestanding. Let's follow those lines and see where they take us.&quot;It was toward one end of the area, at a place where the trees weresomewhat more thickly clumped, that they came to standing walls orpartially standing ones.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;Good enough for a beginning. We're landing.&quot;<br />
  Chapter 9 :Facing the Pack<br />
  35The Far Star came to rest at the bottom of a smallrise, a hill in the generally flat countryside. Almost without thought,Trevize had taken it for granted that it would be best for the ship notto be visible for miles in every direction.<br />
  He said, &quot;The temperature outside is 24 C., the wind is about elevenkilometers per hour from the west, and it is partly cloudy. The computerdoes not know enough about the general air circulation to be able topredict the weather. However, since the humidity is some forty percent,it seems scarcely about to rain. On the whole, we seem to have chosen acomfortable latitude or season of the year, and after Comporellon that'sa pleasure.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that as the planet continues tounterraform, the weather will become more extreme.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm sure of that,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  Be as sure as you like, said Trevize. &quot;We have thousands of yearsof leeway. Right now, it's still a pleasant planet and will continue tobe so for our lifetimes and far beyond.&quot;He was clasping a broad belt about his waist as he spoke, and Blisssaid sharply, &quot;What's that, Trevize?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just my old navy training,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I'm not going into anunknown world unarmed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you seriously intending to carry weapons?&quot;<br />
&quot;Absolutely. Here on my right&quot; he slapped a holster thatcontained a massive weapon with a broad muzzle &quot;is my blaster,and here on my left&quot; a smaller weapon with a thin muzzle thatcontained no opening &quot;is my neuronic whip.&quot;<br />
&quot;Two varieties of murder,&quot; said Bliss, with distaste.<br />
  Only one. The blaster kills. The neuronic whip doesn't. It juststimulates the pain nerves, and it hurts so that you can wish you weredead, I'm told. Fortunately, I've never been at the wrong end of one.&quot;Why are you taking them?&quot;I told you. It's an enemy world.&quot;Trevize, it's an empty world.&quot;Is it? There's no technological society, it would seem, but what ifthere are post-technological primitives. They may not possess anythingworse than clubs or rocks, but those can kill, too.Bliss looked exasperated, but lowered her voice in an effort to bereasonable. &quot;I detect no human neuronic activity, Trevize. That eliminatesprimitives of any type, post-technological or otherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then I won't have to use my weapons,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Still, what harmwould there be in carrying them? They'll just make me a little heavier,and since the gravitational pull at the surface is about ninety-onepercent that of Terminus, I can afford the weight. Listen,the ship may be unarmed as a ship, but it has a reasonable supply ofhand-weapons. I suggest that you two also &quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Bliss at once. &quot;I will not make even a gesture in thedirection of killing or of inflicting pain, either.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's not a question of killing, but of avoiding being killed, ifyou see what I mean.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can protect myself in my own way.&quot;<br />
&quot;Janov?&quot;Pelorat hesitated. &quot;We didn't have arms on Comporellon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come, Janov, Comporellon was a known quantity, a world associatedwith the Foundation. Besides we were at once taken into custody. If we hadhad weapons, they would have been taken away. Do you want a blaster?&quot;Pelorat shook his head. &quot;I've never been in the Navy, old chap. Iwouldn't know how to use one of those things and, in an emergency, I wouldnever think of it in time. I'd just run and and get killed.&quot;<br />
&quot;You won't get killed, Pel,&quot; said Bliss energetically. &quot;Gaia has youin my/our/its protection, and that posturing naval hero as well.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Good. I have no objection to being protected, but I amnot posturing. I am simply making assurance doubly sure, and if I neverhave to make a move toward these things, I'll be completely pleased,I promise you. Still I must have them.&quot;He patted both weapons affectionately and said, &quot;Now let's step outon this world which may not have felt the weight of human beings uponits surface for thousands of years.&quot;36&quot;I have a feeling,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that it must berather late in the day, but the sun is high enough to make it near noon,perhaps.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suspect,&quot; said Trevize, looking about the quiet panorama, &quot;thatyour feeling originates out of the sun's orange tint, which gives it asunset feel. If we're still here at actual sunset and the cloud formationsare proper, we ought to experience a deeper red than we're used to. Idon't know whether you'll find it beautiful or depressing. Forthat matter it was probably even more extreme on Comporellon, but therewe were indoors virtually all the time.&quot;He turned slowly, considering the surroundings in all directions. Inaddition to the almost subliminal oddness of the light, there was thedistinctive smell of the world or this section of it. It seemeda little musty, but far from actively unpleasant.<br />
  The trees nearby were of middling height, and looked old, with gnarledbark and trunks a little off the vertical, though because of a prevailingwind or something off-color about the soil he couldn't tell. Was itthe trees that lent a somehow menacing ambience to the world or was itsomething else less material?<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;What do you intend to do, Trevize? Surely we didn't comeall this distance to enjoy the view?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Actually, perhaps that ought to be my part of it justnow. I would suggest that Janov explore this place. There are ruinsoff in that direction and he's the one who can judge the value of anyrecords he might find. I imagine he can understand writings or films inarchaic Galactic and I know quite well I wouldn't. And I suppose, Bliss,you want to go with him in order to protect him. As for me, I will stayhere as a guard on the outer rim.&quot;<br />
&quot;A guard against what? Primitives with rocks and clubs?&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps.&quot; And then the smile that had hovered about his lips fadedand he said, &quot;Oddly enough, Bliss, I'm a little uneasy about this place. Ican't say why.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Come, Bliss. I've been a home-body collector ofold tales all my life, so I've never actually put my hands on ancientdocuments. Just imagine if we could find &quot;Trevize watched them walk away, Pelorat's voice fading as he walkedeagerly toward the ruins; Bliss swinging along at his side.<br />
  Trevize listened absently and then turned back to continue his studyof the surroundings. What could there be to rouse apprehension?<br />
  He had never actually set foot upon a world without a human population,but he had viewed many from space. Usually, they were small worlds, notlarge enough to hold either water or air, but they had been useful asmarking a meeting site during naval maneuvers (there had been no war inhis lifetime, or for a century before his birth but maneuvers went on),or as an exercise in simulated emergency repairs. Ships he had been onhad been in orbit about such worlds, or had even rested on them, but hehad never had occasion to step off the ships at those times.<br />
  Was it that he was now actually standing on an empty world? Would hehave felt the same if he had been standing on one of the many small,airless worlds he had encountered in his student days and evensince?<br />
  He shook his head. It wouldn't have bothered him. He was sure ofthat. He would have been in a space suit, as he had been innumerabletimes when he was free of his ship in space. It was a familiar situationand contact with a mere lump of rock would have produced no alterationin the familiarity. Surely!<br />
  Of course He was not wearing a space suit now.<br />
  He was standing on a habitable world, as comfortable to the feel asTerminus would be far more comfortable than Comporellon had been. Heexperienced the wind against his cheek, the warmth of the sun on his back,the rustle of vegetation in his ears. Everything was familiar, exceptthat there were no human beings on it at least, not any longer.<br />
  Was that it? Was it that that made the world seem so eerie? Was itthat it was not merely an uninhabited world, but a deserted one?<br />
  He had never been on a deserted world before; never heard of a desertedworld before; never thought a world could be deserted. Allthe worlds he had known of till now, once they had been populated byhuman beings, remained so populated forever.<br />
  He looked up toward the sky. Nothing else had deserted it. Anoccasional bird flew across his line of vision, seeming more natural,somehow, than the slate-blue sky between the orange-tinted fair-weatherclouds. (Trevize was certain that, given a few days on the planet, hewould become accustomed to the off-color so that sky and clouds wouldgrow to seem normal to him.)He heard birdsongs from the trees, and the softer noise ofinsects. Bliss had mentioned butterflies earlier and here theywere in surprising numbers and in several colorful varieties.<br />
  There were also occasional rustlings in the clumps of grass thatsurrounded the trees, but he could not quite make out what was causingthem.<br />
  Nor did the obvious presence of life in his vicinity rouse fear inhim. As Bliss had said, terraformed worlds had, from the very first,lacked dangerous animals. The fairy tales of childhood, and the heroicfantasies of his teenage years were invariably set on a legendary worldthat must have been derived from the vague myths of Earth. The hyperdramaholoscreen had been filled with monsters lions, unicorns, dragons,whales, brontosaurs, bears. There were dozens of them with names hecould not remember; some of them surely mythical, and perhaps all ofthem. There were smaller animals that bit and stung, even plants thatwere fearful to the touch but only in fiction. He had once heardthat primitive honeybees were able to sting, but certainly no red beeswere in any way harmful.<br />
  Slowly, he walked to the right, skirting the border of the hill. Thegrass was tall and rank, but sparse, growing in clumps. He made his wayamong the trees, also growing in clumps.<br />
  Then he yawned. Certainly, nothing exciting was happening, andhe wondered if he might not retreat to the ship and take a nap. No,unthinkable. Clearly, he had to stand on guard.<br />
  Perhaps he ought to do sentry duty-marching, one, two, one two,swinging about with a snap and performing complicated maneuverings witha parade electro-rod. (It was a weapon no warrior had used in threecenturies, but it was still absolutely essential at drill, for no reasonanyone could ever advance.)He grinned at the thought of it, then wondered if he ought to joinPelorat and Bliss in the ruins. Why? What good would he do?<br />
  Suppose he saw something that Pelorat had happened tooverlook? Well, time enough to make the attempt after Peloratreturned. If there was anything that might be found easily, by all meanslet Pelorat make the discovery.<br />
  Might the two be in trouble? Foolish! What possible kind oftrouble?<br />
  And if there were trouble, they would call out.<br />
  He stopped to listen. He heard nothing.<br />
  And then the irresistible thought of sentry duty recurred to himand he found himself marching, feet moving up and down with a stamp,an imaginary electro-rod coming off one shoulder, whirling, and beingheld out straight before him, exactly vertical-whirling again, end overend, and back over the other shoulder. Then, with a smart about-face,he was looking toward the ship (rather far-off now) once more.<br />
  And when he did that, he froze in reality, and not in sentrymake-believe.<br />
  He was not alone.<br />
  Until then, he had not seen any living creature other than plantgrowth, insects, and an occasional bird. He had neither seen nor heardanything approach but now an animal stood between him and theship.<br />
  Sheer surprise at the unexpected event deprived him, for a moment, ofthe ability to interpret what he saw. It was not till after a perceptibleinterval that he knew what he was looking at.<br />
  It was only a dog.<br />
  Trevize was not a dog person. He had never owned a dog and hefelt no surge of friendliness toward one when he encountered it. Hefelt no such surge this time, either. He thought, rather impatiently,that there was no world on which these creatures had not accompaniedmen. They existed in countless varieties and Trevize had long had theweary impression that each world had at least one variety characteristicof itself. Nevertheless, all varieties were constant in this: whether theywere kept for entertainment, show, or some form of useful work theywere bred to love and trust human beings.<br />
  It was a love and trust Trevize had never appreciated. He had oncelived with a woman who had had a dog. That dog, whom Trevize toleratedfor the sake of the woman, conceived a deep-seated adoration for him,followed him about, leaned against him when relaxing (all fifty poundsof him), covered him with saliva and hair at unexpected moments, andsquatted outside the door and moaned whenever he and the woman weretrying to engage in sex.<br />
  From that experience, Trevize had emerged with the firm convictionthat for some reason known only to the canine mind and its odor-analyzingability, he was a fixed object of doggish devotion.<br />
  Therefore, once the initial surprise was over, he surveyed thedog without concern. It was a large dog, lean and rangy, and with longlegs. It was staring at him with no obvious sign of adoration. Its mouthwas open in what might have been taken as a welcoming grin, but theteeth displayed were somehow large and dangerous, and Trevize decidedthat he would be more comfortable without the dog in his line of view.<br />
  It occurred to him, then, that the dog had never seen a human being,and that countless canine generations preceding had never seen one. Thedog might have been as astonished and uncertain at the sudden appearanceof a human being as Trevize had been at that of the dog. Trevize, atleast, had quickly recognized the dog for what it was, but the dog didnot have that advantage. It was still puzzled, and perhaps alarmed.<br />
  Clearly, it would not be safe to leave an animal that large, andwith such teeth, in an alarmed state. Trevize realized that it would benecessary to establish a friendship at once.<br />
  Very slowly, he approached the dog (no sudden motions, of course). Heheld out his hand, ready to allow it to be sniffed, and made soft,soothing sounds, most of which consisted of &quot;Nice doggy&quot; somethinghe found intensely embarrassing.<br />
  The dog, eyes fixed on Trevize, backed away a step or two, as thoughin distrust, and then its upper lip wrinkled into a snarl and from itsmouth there issued a rasping growl. Although Trevize had never seen a dogbehave so, there was no way of interpreting the action as representinganything but menace.<br />
  Trevize therefore stopped advancing and froze. His eyes caughtmotion to one side, and his head turned slowly. There were two otherdogs advancing from that direction. They looked just as deadly as thefirst.<br />
  Deadly? That adjective occurred to him only now, and its dreadfulappropriateness was unmistakable.<br />
  His heart was suddenly pounding. The way to the ship was blocked. Hecould not run aimlessly, for those long canine legs would reach him inyards. If he stood his ground and used his blaster, then while he killedone, the other two would be upon him. Off in the distance, he could seeother dogs approaching. Was there some way in which they communicated? Didthey hunt in packs?<br />
  Slowly, he shifted ground leftward, in a direction in which therewere no dogs as yet. Slowly.........<br />
  The dogs shifted ground with him. He felt certain that all that savedhim from instant attack was the fact that the dogs had never seen orsmelled anything like himself before. They had no established behaviorpattern they could follow in his case.<br />
  If he ran, of course, that would represent something familiar to thedogs. They would know what to do if something the size of Trevize showedfear and ran. They would run, too. Faster.<br />
  Trevize kept sidling toward a tree. He had the wildest desire to moveupward where the dogs could not follow. They moved with him, snarlingsoftly, coming closer. All three had their eyes fixed unwinkingly uponhim. Two more were joining them and, farther off, Trevize could seestill other dogs approaching. At some point, when he was close enough,he would have to make the dash. He could not wait too long, or run toosoon. Either might be fatal.<br />
  Now!<br />
  He probably set a personal record for acceleration and even so it wasa near thing. He felt the snap of jaws close on the heel of one foot,and for just moment he was held fast before the teeth slid off thetough ceramoid.<br />
  He was not skilled at climbing trees. He had not climbed one since hewas ten and, as he recalled, that had been a clumsy effort. In this case,though, the trunk was not quite vertical, and the bark was gnarled andoffered handholds. What was more, he was driven by necessity, and it isremarkable what one can do if the need is great enough.<br />
  Trevize found himself sitting in a crotch, perhaps ten meters aboveground. For the moment he was totally unaware that he had scraped handand that it was oozing blood. At the base of the tree, five dogs now ontheir haunches, staring upward, tongues lolling, all looking patientlyexpectant.<br />
  What now?<br />
  37Trevize was not in a position to think about thesituation in logical detail. Rather, he experienced flashes of thought inodd and distorted sequence which, if he had eventually sorted them out,would have come to this Bliss had earlier maintained that in terraforming a planet, humanbeings would establish an unbalanced economy, which they would be able tokeep from falling apart only by unending effort. For instance, no Settlershad brought with them any of the large predators. Small ones could not behelped. Insects, parasites even small hawks, shrews, and so on.<br />
  Those dramatic animals of legend and vague literaryaccounts tigers, grizzly bears, orcs, crocodiles? Who would carrythem from world to world even if there were sense to it? And where wouldthere be sense to it?<br />
  It meant that human beings were the only large predators, and it wasup to them to cull those plants and animals that, left to themselves,would smother in their own overplenty.<br />
  And if human beings somehow vanished, then other predators must taketheir place. But what predators? The most sizable predators toleratedby human beings were dogs and cats, tamed and living on human bounty.<br />
  What if no human beings remained to feed them? They must thenfind their own food for their survival and, in all truth, forthe survival of those they preyed on, whose numbers had to be kept incheck lest overpopulation do a hundred times the damage that predationswould do.<br />
  So dogs would multiply, in their variations, with the large onesattacking the large, untended herbivores; the smaller ones preying onbirds and rodents. Cats would prey by night as dogs did by day; theformer singly, the latter in packs.<br />
  And perhaps evolution would eventually produce more varieties, tofill additional environmental niches. Would some dogs eventually developsea-going characteristics to enable them to live on fish; and would somecats develop gliding abilities to hunt the clumsier birds in the air aswell as on the ground?<br />
  In flashes, all this came to Trevize while he struggled with moresystematic thought to tell him what he might do.<br />
  The number of dogs kept growing. He counted twenty-three nowsurrounding the tree and there were others approaching. How large wasthe pack? What did it matter? It was large enough already.<br />
  He withdrew his blaster from its holster, but the solid feel of thebutt in his hand did not give him the sense of security he would haveliked. When had he last inserted an energy unit into it and how manycharges could he fire? Surely not twenty-three.<br />
  What about Pelorat and Bliss? If they emerged, would the dogs turnon them? Were they safe even if they did not emerge? If the dogs sensedthe presence of two human beings inside the ruins, what could stop themfrom attacking them there? Surely there would be no doors or barriersto hold them off.<br />
  Could Bliss stop them, and even drive them away? Could she concentrateher powers through hyperspace to the desired pitch of intensity? Forhow long could she maintain them?<br />
  Should he call for help then? Would they come running if he yelled,and would the dogs flee under Bliss's glare? (Would it take a glare orwas it simply a mental action undetectable to onlookers without theability?) Or, if they appeared, would they then be torn apart underthe eyes of Trevize, who would be forced to watch, helplessly, from therelative safety of his post in the tree?<br />
  No, he would have to use his blaster. If he could kill one dog andfrighten them off for just a while, he could scramble down the tree,yell for Pelorat and Bliss, kill a second dog if they showed signs ofreturning, and all three could then hustle into the ship.<br />
  He adjusted the intensity of the microwave beam to the three-quartermark. That should be ample to kill a dog with a loud report. The reportwould serve to frighten the dogs away, and he would be conservingenergy.<br />
  He aimed carefully at a dog in the middle of the pack, one who seemed(in Trevize's own imagination, at least) to exude a greater malignancythan the rest perhaps only because he sat more quietly and,therefore, seemed more cold-bloodedly intent on his prey. The dog wasstaring directly at the weapon now, as though it scorned the worstTrevize could do.<br />
  It occurred to Trevize that he had never himself fired a blasterat a human being, or seen anyone else do it. There had been firing atwater-filled dummies of leather and plastic during training; with thewater almost instantaneously heated to the boiling point, and shreddingthe covering as it exploded.<br />
  But who, in the absence of war, would fire at a human being? Andwhat human being would withstand a blaster and force its use? Only here,on world made pathological by the disappearance of human beings With that odd ability of the brain to note something utterly besidethe point, Trevize was aware of the fact that a cloud had hidden thesun-and then he fired.<br />
  There was an odd shimmer of the atmosphere on a straight line fromthe muzzle of the blaster to the dog; a vague sparkle that might havegone unnoticed if the sun were still shining unhindered.<br />
  The dog must have felt the initial surge of heat, and made thesmallest motion as though it were about to leap. And then it exploded,as a portion its blood and cellular contents vaporized.<br />
  The explosion made a disappointingly small noise, for the dog'sintegument was simply not as tough as that of the dummies they hadpracticed on. Flesh, skin, blood, and bone were scattered, however,and Trevize felt his stomach heave.<br />
  The dogs started back, some having been bombarded with uncomfortablywarm fragments. That was only a momentary hesitation, however. Theycrowded against each other suddenly, in order to eat what had beenprovided. Trevize felt his sickness increase. He was not frighteningthem; he was feeding them. At that rate, they would never leave. In fact,the smell of fresh blood and warm meat would attract still more dogs,and perhaps other smaller predators as well.<br />
  A voice called out, &quot;Trevize. What &quot;Trevize looked outward. Bliss and Pelorat had emerged from theruins. Bliss had stopped short, her arms thrown out to keep Peloratback. She stared at the dogs. The situation was obvious and clear. Shehad to ask nothing.<br />
  Trevize shouted, &quot;I tried to drive them off without involving youand Janov. Can you hold them off?&quot;<br />
&quot;Barely,&quot; said Bliss, not shouting, so that Trevize had troublehearing her even though the dogs' snarling had quieted as though asoothing soundabsorbent blanket had been thrown over them.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;There are too many of them, and I am not familiar withtheir pattern of neuronic activity. We have no such savage things onGaia.&quot;<br />
&quot;Or on Terminus. Or on any civilized world,&quot; shouted Trevize. &quot;I'llshoot as many of them as I can and you try to handle the rest. A smallernumber will give you less trouble.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Trevize. Shooting them will just attract others. Staybehind me, Pel. There's no way you can protect me. Trevize, yourother weapon.&quot;<br />
&quot;The neuronic whip?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. That produces pain. Low power. Low power!&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you afraid of hurting them?&quot; called out Trevize in anger. &quot;Isthis a time to consider the sacredness of life?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm considering Pel's. Also mine. Do as I say. Low power, and shootat one of the dogs. I can't hold them much longer.&quot;The dogs had drifted away from the tree and had surrounded Bliss andPelorat, who stood with their backs to a crumbling wall. The dogs nearestthe two made hesitant attempts to come closer still, whining a bit asthough trying to puzzle out what it was that held them off when theycould sense nothing that would do it. Some tried uselessly to scrambleup the wall and attack from behind.<br />
  Trevize's hand was trembling as he adjusted the neuronic whip to lowpower. The neuronic whip used much less energy than the blaster did,and a single power-cartridge could produce hundreds of whip-like strokesbut, come to think of it, he didn't remember when he had last chargedthis weapon, either.<br />
  It was not so important to aim the whip. Since conserving energy wasnot as critical, he could use it in a sweep across the mass of dogs. Thatwas the traditional method of controlling crowds that showed signs ofturning dangerous.<br />
  However, he followed Bliss's suggestion. He aimed at one dogand fired. The dog fell over, its legs twitching. It emitted loud,high-pitched squeals.<br />
  The other dogs backed away from the stricken beast, ears flatteningbackward against their heads. Then, squealing in their turn, they turnedand left, at first slowly, then more rapidly, and finally, at a fullrace. The dog who had been hit, scrambled painfully to its legs, andlimped away whimpering, much the last of them.<br />
  The noise vanished in the distance, and Bliss said, &quot;We had betterget into the ship. They will come back. Or others will.&quot;Trevize thought that never before had he manipulated the ship's entrymechanism so rapidly. And it was possible he might never do so again.<br />
  38Night had fallen before Trevize felt somethingapproaching the normal. The small patch of syntho-skin on the scrape onhis hand had soothed the physical pain, but there was a scrape on hispsyche for which soothing was not so easy.<br />
  It was not the mere exposure to danger. He could react to that as wellas any ordinarily brave person might. It was the totally unlooked-fordirection from which the danger had come. It was the feeling of theridiculous. How would it look if people were to find out he had beentreed by snarling dogs ? It would scarcely be worse if hehad been put to flight by the whirring of angry canaries.<br />
  For hours, he kept listening for a new attack on the part of thedogs, for ths, sound of howls, for the scratch of claws against theouter hull.<br />
  Pelorat, by comparison, seemed quite cool. &quot;There was no question inmy mind, old chap, that Bliss would handle it, but I must say you firedthe weapon well.&quot;Trevize shrugged. He was in no mood to discuss the matter.<br />
  Pelorat was holding his library the one compact disc on whichhis lifetime of research into myths and legends were stored andwith it he retreated into his bedroom where he kept his small reader.<br />
  He seemed quite pleased with himself. Trevize noticed that but didn'tfollow it up. Time for that later when his mind wasn't quite as takenup with dogs.<br />
  Bliss said, rather tentatively, when the two were alone, &quot;I presumeyou were taken by surprise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Quite,&quot; said Trevize gloomily. &quot;Who would think that at the sightof a dog a dog  I should run for my life.&quot;<br />
&quot;Twenty thousand years without men and it would not be quite a dog.<br />
  Those beasts must now be the dominant large predators.&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;I figured that out while I was sitting on thetree branch being a dominated prey. You were certainly right about anunbalanced ecology.&quot;<br />
&quot;Unbalanced, certainly, from the human standpoint but consideringhow efficiently the dogs seem to be going about their business, I wonderif Pel may be right in his suggestion that the ecology could balanceitself, with various environmental niches being filled by evolvingvariations of the relatively few species that were once brought tothe world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oddly enough,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;the same thought occurred to me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Provided, of course, the unbalance is not so great that the processof righting itself takes too long. The planet might become completelynonviable before that.&quot;Trevize grunted.<br />
  Bliss looked at him thoughtfully, &quot;How is it that you thought ofarming yourself?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;It did me little good. It was your ability &quot;<br />
&quot;Not entirely. I needed your weapon. At short notice, with onlyhyperspatial contact with the rest of Gaia, with so many individualminds of so unfamiliar a nature, I could have done nothing without yourneuronic whip.&quot;<br />
&quot;My blaster was useless. I tried that.&quot;<br />
&quot;With a blaster, Trevize, a dog merely disappears. The rest may besurprised, but not frightened.&quot;<br />
&quot;Worse than that,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;They ate the remnants. I was bribingthem to stay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I see that might be the effect. The neuronic whip isdifferent. It inflicts pain, and a dog in pain emits cries of a kind thatare well understood by other dogs who, by conditioned reflex, if nothingelse, begin to feel frightened themselves. With the dogs already disposedtoward fright, I merely nudged their minds, and off they went.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but you realized the whip was the more deadly of the two inthis case. I did not.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am accustomed to dealing with minds. You are not. That's why Iinsisted on low power and aiming at one dog. I did not want so much painthat it killed a dog and left him silent. I did not want the pain sodispersed as to cause mere whimpering. I wanted strong pain concentratedat one point.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you got it, Bliss,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It worked perfectly. I oweyou considerable gratitude.&quot;<br />
&quot;You begrudge that,&quot; said Bliss thoughtfully, &quot;because it seems to youthat you played a ridiculous role. And yet, I repeat, I could have donenothing without your weapons. What puzzles me is how you can explainyour arming yourself in the face of my assurance that there were nohuman beings on this world, something I am still certain is a fact. Didyou foresee the dogs?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I certainly didn't. Not consciously, at least. AndI don't habitually go armed, either. It never even occurred to me to puton weapons at Comporellon. But I can't allow myself to trip intothe trap of feeling it was magic, either. It couldn't have been. I suspectthat once we began talking about unbalanced ecologies earlier, I somehowhad an unconscious glimpse of animals grown dangerous in the absence ofhuman beings. That is clear enough in hindsight, but I might have had a whiff of it in foresight. Nothing more than that.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Don't dismiss it that casually. I participated in thesame conversation concerning unbalanced ecologies and I didn't havethat same foresight. It is that special trick of foresight in you thatGaia values. I can see, too, that it must be irritating to you to havea hidden foresight the nature of which you cannot detect; to act withdecision, but without clear reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;The usual expression on Terminus is `to act on a hunch.'&quot;<br />
&quot;On Gaia we say, `to know without thought.' You don't like knowingwithout thought, do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;It bothers me, yes. I don't like being driven by hunches. I assumehunch has reason behind it, but not knowing the reason makes me feelI'm not in control of my own mind a kind of mild madness.&quot;<br />
&quot;And when you decided in favor of Gaia and Galaxia, you were actingon s hunch, and now you seek the reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have said so at least a dozen times.&quot;<br />
&quot;And I have refused to accept your statement as literal truth. Forthat I am sorry. I will oppose you in this no longer. I hope, though,that I may continue to point out items in Gaia's favor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;if you, in turn, recognize that I may notaccept them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Does it occur to you, then, that this Unknown World is reverting to akind of savagery, and perhaps to eventual desolation and uninhabitability,because of the removal of a single species that is capable of acting asa guiding intelligence? If the world were Gaia, or better yet, a part ofGalaxia, this could not happen. The guiding intelligence would still existin the form of the Galaxy as a whole, and ecology, whenever unbalanced,and for whatever reason, would move toward balance again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Does that mean that dogs would no longer eat?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course they would eat, just as human beings do. They would however,with purpose, in order to balance the ecology under deliberate direction,and not as a result of random circumstance.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;The loss of individual freedom might not matter to dogs,but it must matter to human beings. And what if all human beings were removed from existence, everywhere, and not merelyon one world or on several? What if Galaxia were left without humanbeings at all? Would there still be a guiding intelligence? Would allother life forms and inanimate matter be able to put together a commonintelligence adequate for the purpose?&quot;Bliss hesitated. &quot;Such a situation,&quot; she said, &quot;has never beenexperienced. Nor does there seem any likelihood that it will ever beexperienced in the future.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Hut doesn't it seem obvious to you, that the humanmind is qualitatively different from everything else, and that if itwere absent, the sum total of all other consciousness could not replaceit. Would it not be true, then, that human beings are a special case andmust be treated as such? They should not be fused even with one another,let alone with nonhuman objects.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet you decided in favor of Galaxia.&quot;<br />
&quot;For an overriding reason I cannot make out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps that overriding reason was a glimpse of the effect ofunbalanced ecologies? Might it not have been your reasoning that everyworld in the Galaxy is on a knife-edge, with instability on either side,and that only Galaxia could prevent such disasters as are taking placeon this world to say nothing of the continuing interhuman disastersof war and administrative failure.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Unbalanced ecologies were not in my mind at the time of mydecision.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can you be sure?&quot;<br />
&quot;I may not know what it is I'm foreseeing, but if something issuggested afterward, I would recognize it if that were indeed what Iforesaw. As it seems to me I may have foreseen dangerous animalson this world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Bliss soberly, &quot;we might have been dead as a resultof those dangerous animals if it had not been for a combination ofour powers, your foresight and my mentalism. Come, then, let us befriends.&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;If you wish.&quot;There was a chill in his voice that caused Bliss's eyebrows to rise,but at this point Pelorat burst in, nodding his head as though preparedto shake it off its foundations.<br />
  I think, he said, &quot;we have it.&quot;39Trevize did not, in general, believe in easy victories,and yet it was only human to fall into belief against one's betterjudgment. He felt the muscles in his chest and throat tighten, but managedto say, &quot;The location of Earth? Have you discovered that, Janov?&quot;Pelorat stared at Trevize for a moment, and deflated. &quot;Well, no,&quot;he said, visibly abashed. &quot;Not quite that. Actually, Golan, notthat aaaall. I had forgotten about that. It was something else that Idiscovered in the ruins. I suppose it's not really important.&quot;Trevize managed a long breath and said, &quot;Never mind, Janov. Everyfinding is important. What was it you came in to say?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;it's just that almost nothing survived,you understand. Twenty thousand years of storm and wind don't leavemuch. What's more, plant life is gradually destructive and animallife But never mindaall that. The point is that `almost nothing'<br />
  is not the same as `nothing.'<br />
  The ruins must have included a public building, for there was somefallen stone, or concrete, with incised lettering upon it. There washardly anything visible, you understand, old chap, but I took photographswith one of those cameras we have on board ship, the kind with built-incomputer enhancement I never got round to asking permission totake one, Golan, but it was important, and I Trevize waved his hand in impatient dismissal. &quot;Go on!&quot;<br />
&quot;I could make out some of the lettering, which was very archaic. Evenwith computer enhancement and with my own fair skill at reading Archaic,it was impossible to make out much except for one short phrase. Theletters there were larger and a bit clearer than the rest. They may havebeen incised more deeply because they identified the world itself. Thephrase reads, `Planet Aurora,' so I imagine this world we rest upon isnamed Aurora, or was named Aurora.&quot;<br />
&quot;It had to be named something,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  &quot;Yes, but names are very rarely chosen at random. I made a carefulsearch of my library just now and there are two old legends, from twowidely spaced worlds, as it happens, so that one can reasonably supposethem to be of independent origin, if one remembers that. But nevermind that. In both legends, Aurora is used as a name for the dawn. Wecan suppose that Aurora may have actually meant dawn insome pre-Galactic language.<br />
  As it happens, some word for dawn or daybreak is often used as aname for space stations or other structures that are the first built oftheir kind. If this world is called Dawn in whatever language, it maybe the first of its kind, too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize said, &quot;<br />
&quot;Are you getting ready to suggest that this planet isEarth and that Aurora is an alternate name for it because it representsthe dawn of life and of man?&quot;<br />
&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;<br />
&quot;I couldn't go that far, Golan.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize said, with a trace of bitterness, &quot;<br />
&quot;There is, after all,no radioactive surface, no giant satellite, no gas giant with hugerings.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly. But Deniador, back on Comporellon, seemed to think thiswas one of the worlds that was once inhabited by the first wave ofSettlers the Spacers. If it were, then its name, Aurora, mightindicate it to have been the first of those Spacer worlds. We might,at this very moment, be resting on the oldest human world in the Galaxyexcept for Earth itself. Isn't that exciting?&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Interesting, at any rate, Janov, but isn't that a great deal toinfer merely from the name, Aurora?&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;There's more,&quot;<br />
&quot; said Pelorat excitedly. &quot;<br />
&quot;As far as I could checkin my records there is no world in the Galaxy today with the name of`Aurora,' and I'm sure your computer will verify that. As I said, thereare all sorts of world and other objects named `Dawn' in various ways,but no one uses the actual word `Aurora.'&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Why should they? If it's a pre-Galactic word, it wouldn't be likelyto be popular.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;But names do remain, even when they're meaningless. Ifthis were the first settled world, it would be famous; it might even,for a while, have been the dominant world of the Galaxy. Surely, therewould be other worlds calling themselves `New Aurora,' or `Aurora Minor,'&quot;<br />
  or something like that. And then others &quot;Trevize broke in. &quot;Perhaps it wasn't the first settled world. Perhapsit was never of any importance.&quot;<br />
&quot;There's a better reason in my opinion, my dear chap.&quot;<br />
&quot;What would that be, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;If the first wave of settlements was overtaken by a second waveto which all the worlds of the Galaxy now belong as Deniadorsaid then there is very likely to have been a period of hostilitybetween the two waves. The second wave making up the worlds thatnow exist would not use the names given to any of the worlds ofthe first wave. In that way, we can infer from the fact that the name`Aurora' has never been repeated that there were two waves of Settlers,and that this is a world of the first wave.&quot;Trevize smiled. &quot;I'm getting a glimpse of how you mythologists work,Janov. You build a beautiful superstructure, but it may be standingon air. The legends tell us that the Settlers of the first wave wereaccompanied by numerous robots, and that these were supposed to be theirundoing. Now if we could find a robot on this world, I'd be willingto accept all this first-wave supposition, but we can't expect aftertwenty thou &quot;Pelorat, whose mouth had been working, managed to find his voice. &quot;But,Golan, haven't I told you? No, of course, I haven't. I'm soexcited I can't put things in the right order. There was a robot.&quot;40Trevize rubbed his forehead, almost as though he werein pain. He said, &quot;A robot? There was a robot?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pelorat, nodding his head emphatically.<br />
  How do you know?&quot;Why, it was a robot. How could I fail to know one if I see one?&quot;Have you ever seen a robot before?&quot;No, but it was a metal object that looked like a human being. Head,arms, legs, torso. Of course, when I say metal, it was mostly rust, andwhen I walked toward it, I suppose the vibration of my tread damaged itfurther, so that when I reached to touch it &quot;Why should you touch it?&quot;Well, I suppose I couldn't quite believe my eyes. It was an automaticresponse. As soon as I touched it, it crumbled. But &quot;Yes?&quot;Before it quite did, its eyes seemed to glow very faintly and itmade a sound as though it were trying to say something.&quot;You mean it was still functioning ?&quot;Just barely, Golan. Then it collapsed.Trevize turned to Bliss. &quot;Do you corroborate all this, Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;It was a robot, and we saw it,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  And was it still functioning?Bliss said tonelessly, &quot;As it crumbled, I caught a faint sense ofneuronic activity.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can there have been neuronic activity? A robot doesn't have anorganic brain built of cells.&quot;<br />
&quot;It has the computerized equivalent, I imagine,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;and Iwould detect that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you detect a robotic rather than a human mentality?&quot;Bliss pursed her lips and said, &quot;It was too feeble to decide anythingabout it except that it was there.&quot;Trevize looked at Bliss, then at Pelorat, and said, in a tone ofexasperation, &quot;This changes everything.&quot;<br />
  Part Four - Solaria Chapter 10: Robots<br />
  41Trevize seemed lost in thought during dinner, and Blissconcentrated on the food.<br />
  Pelorat, the only one who seemed anxious to speak, pointed out that ifthe world they were on was Aurora and if it was the first settled world,it ought to be fairly close to Earth.<br />
  It might pay to scour the immediate stellar neighborhood, hesaid. &quot;It would only mean sifting through a few hundred stars atmost.&quot;Trevize muttered that hit-and-miss was a last resort and he wanted asmuch information about Earth as possible before attempting to approachit even if he found it. He said no more and Pelorat, clearly squelched,dwindled into silence as well.<br />
  After the meal, as Trevize continued to volunteer nothing, Peloratsaid tentatively, &quot;Are we to be staying here, Golan?&quot;<br />
&quot;Overnight, anyway,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I need to do a bit morethinking.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is it safe?&quot;<br />
&quot;Unless there's something worse than dogs about,&quot; said Trevize,&quot;we're quite safe here in the ship.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;How long would it take to lift off, if there issomething worse than dogs about?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;The computer is on launch alert. I think we can manageto take off in between two and three minutes. And it will warn us quiteeffectively if anything unexpected takes place, so I suggest we allget some sleep. Tomorrow morning, I'll come to a decision as to thenext move.&quot;Easy to say, thought Trevize, as he found himself staring at thedarkness. He was curled up, partly dressed, on the floor of the computerroom. It was quite uncomfortable, but he was sure that his bed would beno more conducive to sleep at this time and here at least he could takeaction at once if the computer sounded an alarm.<br />
  Then he heard footsteps and automatically sat up, hitting his headagainst the edge of the desk not hard enough to do damage, buthard enough to make rubbing and grimacing a necessity.<br />
  Janov? he said in a muffled voice, eyes tearing.<br />
  No. It's Bliss.Trevize reached over the edge of the table with one hand to make atleast semicontact with the computer, and a soft light showed Bliss ina light pink wraparound.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I looked in your bedroom and you weren't there. There was no mistakingyour neuronic activity, however, and I followed it. You were clearlyawake so I walked in.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but what is it you want?&quot;She sat down against the wall, knees up, and cradled her chin againstthem. She said, &quot;Don't be concerned. I have no designs on what's leftof your virginity.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't imagine you do,&quot; said Trevize sardonically. &quot;Why aren't youasleep? You need it more than we do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Believe me,&quot; she said in a low, heartfelt tone, &quot;that episode withthe dogs was very draining.&quot;<br />
&quot;I believe that.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I had to talk to you when Pel was sleeping.&quot;<br />
&quot;About what?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;When he told you about the robot, you said that thatchanges everything. What did you mean?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Don't you see that for yourself? We have three setsof coordinates; three Forbidden Worlds. I want to visit all three tolearn as much as possible about Earth before trying to reach it.&quot;He edged a bit closer so that he could speak lower still, then drewaway sharply. He said, &quot;Look, I don't want Janov coming in here lookingfor us. I don't know what he'd think.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's not likely. He's sleeping and I've encouraged that just a bit. Ifhe stirs, I'll know. Go on. You want to visit all three. What'schanged?&quot;<br />
&quot;It wasn't part of my plan to waste time on any world needlessly. Ifthis world, Aurora, had been without human occupation for twenty thousandyears, then it is doubtful that any information of value has survived. Idon't want to spend weeks or months scrabbling uselessly about theplanetary surface, fighting off dogs and cats and bulls or whatever elsemay have become wild and dangerous, just on the hope of finding a scrap ofreference material amid the dust, rust, and decay. It may be that on oneor both of the other Forbidden Worlds there may be human beings and intactlibraries. So it was my intention to leave this world at once. We'dbe out in space now, if I had done so, sleeping in perfect security.&quot;<br />
&quot;But?&quot;<br />
&quot;But if there are robots still functioning on this world, they mayhave important information that we could use. They would be safer todeal with than human beings would be, since, from what I've heard,they must follow orders and can't harm human beings.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you've changed your plan and now you're going to spend time onthis world searching for robots.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't want to, Bliss. It seems to me that robots can't last twentythousand years without maintenance. Yet since you've seen one witha spark of activity still, it's clear I can't rely on my commonsenseguesses about robots. I mustn't lead out of ignorance. Robots may bemore enduring than I imagine, or they may have a certain capacity forself-maintenance.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Listen to me, Trevize, and please keep thisconfidential.&quot;<br />
&quot;Confidential?&quot; said Trevize, raising his voice in surprise. &quot;Fromwhom?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sh! From Pel, of course. Look, you don't have to change yourplans. You were right the first time. There are no functioning robotson this world. I detect nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;You detected that one, and one is as good as &quot;<br />
&quot;I did not detect that one. It was nonfunctioning; long nonfunctioning.&quot;<br />
&quot;You said &quot;<br />
&quot;I know what I said. Pel thought he saw motion and heard sound. Pelis a romantic. He's spent his working life gathering data, but that is adifficult way of making one's mark in the scholarly world. He would dearlylove to make an important discovery of his own. His finding of the word`Aurora' was legitimate and made him happier than you can imagine. Hewanted desperately to find more.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Are you telling me he wanted to make a discovery sobadly he convinced himself he had come upon a functioning robot whenhe hadn't?&quot;<br />
&quot;What he came upon was a lump of rust containing no more consciousnessthan the rock against which it rested.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you supported his story.&quot;<br />
&quot;I could not bring myself to rob him of his discovery. He means somuch to me.<br />
  Trevize stared at her for a full minute; then he said, &quot;Do you mindexplaining why he means so much to you? I want to know. Ireally want to know. To you he must seem an elderly man with nothingromantic about him. He's an Isolate, and you despise Isolates. You'reyoung and beautiful and there must be other parts of Gaia that havethe bodies of vigorous and handsome young men. With them you can havea physical relationship that can resonate through Gaia and bring peaksof ecstasy. So what do you an in Janov?&quot;Bliss looked at Trevize solemnly. &quot;Don't you love him?&quot;Trevize shrugged and said, &quot;I'm fond of him. I suppose you could say,in a nonsexual way, that I love him.&quot;<br />
&quot;You haven't known him very long, Trevize. Why do you love him,in that nonsexual way of yours?&quot;Trevize found himself smiling without being aware of it. &quot;He's suchan odd fellow. I honestly think that never in his life hashe given a single thought to himself. He was ordered to go along with me,and he went. No objection. He wanted me to go to Trantor, but when I saidI wanted to go to Gaia, he never argued. And now he's come along withme in this search for Earth, though he must know it's dangerous. I feelperfectly confident that if he had to sacrifice his life for me orfor anyone he would, and without repining.&quot;<br />
&quot;Would you give your life for him, Trevize?&quot;<br />
&quot;I might, if I didn't have time to think. If I did have time to think,I would hesitate and I might funk it. I'm not as good as heis. And because of that, I have this terrible urge to protect and keephim good. I don't want the Galaxy to teach him not to begood. Do you understand? And I have to protect him from you particularly. I can't bear the thought of you tossing him aside whenwhatever nonsense amuses you now is done with.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I thought you'd think something like that. Don't you supposeI see in Pel what you see in him and even more so, since I cancontact his mind directly? Do I act as though I want to hurt him? WouldI support his fantasy of having seen a functioning robot, if it weren'tthat I couldn't bear to hurt him? Trevize, I am used to what you wouldcall goodness, for every part of Gaia is ready to be sacrificed for thewhole. We know and understand no other course of action. But we give upnothing in so doing, for each part is the whole, though I don't expectyou to understand that. Pel is something different.&quot;Bliss was no longer looking at Trevize. It was as though she weretalking to herself. &quot;He is an Isolate. He is not selfless because he isa part of a greater whole. He is selfless because he is selfless. Doyou understand me? He has all to lose and nothing to gain, and yet heis what he is. He shames me for being what I am without fear of loss,when he is what he is without hope of gain.&quot;She looked up at Trevize again now, very solemnly. &quot;Do you know howmuch more I understand about him than you possibly can? And do you thinkI would harm him in any way?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Bliss, earlier today, you said, `Come, let us befriends,' and all I replied was, `If you wish.' That was grudging ofme, for I was thinking of what you might do to Janov. It is my turn,now. Come, Bliss, let us be friends. You can keep on pointing out theadvantage of Galaxia and I may keep on refusing to accept your arguments,but even so, and despite that, let us be friends.&quot; And he held outhis hand.<br />
  Of course, Trevize, she said, and their hands gripped each otherstrongly.<br />
  42Trevize grinned quietly to himself. It was an internalgrin, for the line of his mouth didn't budge.<br />
  When he had worked with the computer to find the star (if any) of thefirst set of co-ordinates, both Pelorat and Bliss had watched intentlyand had asked questions. Now they stayed in their room and slept or,at any rate, relaxed, and left the job entirely to Trevize.<br />
  In a way, it was flattering, for it seemed to Trevize that by now theyhad simply accepted the fact that Trevize knew what he was doing andrequired no supervision or encouragement. For that matter, Trevize hadgained enough experience from the first episode to rely more thoroughlyon the computer and to feel that it needed, if not none, then at leastless supervision.<br />
  Another star luminous and unrecorded on the Galactic map-showedup. This second star was more luminous than the star about which Auroracircled, and that made it all the more significant that the star wasunrecorded in the computer.<br />
  Trevize marveled at the peculiarities of ancient tradition. Wholecenturies might be telescoped or dropped out of consciousnessaltogether. Entire civilizations might be banished into forgetfulness. Yetout of the midst of these centuries, snatched from those civilizations,might be one or two factual items that would be rememberedundistorted such as these co-ordinates.<br />
  He had remarked on this to Pelorat some time before, and Pelorathad at once told him that it was precisely this that made the studyof myths and legends so rewarding. &quot;The trick is,&quot; Pelorat had said,&quot;to work out or decide which particular components of a legend representaccurate underlying truth. That isn't easy and different mythologistsare likely to pick different components, depending, usually, on whichhappen to suit their particular interpretations.&quot; .<br />
  In any case, the star was right where Deniador's co-ordinates,corrected for time, said it would be. Trevize was prepared, at thismoment, to wager a considerable sum that the third star would be inplace as well. And if it was, Trevize was prepared to suspect that thelegend was further correct in stating that there were fifty ForbiddenWorlds altogether (despite the suspiciously even number) and to wonderwhere the other forty-seven might be.<br />
  A habitable world, Forbidden World, was found circling thestar and by this time its presence didn't cause even a ripple ofsurprise in Trevize's bosom. He had been absolutely sure it would bethere. He set the Far Star into a slow orbit about it.<br />
  The cloud layer was sparse enough to allow a reasonable view of thesurface from space. The world was a watery one, as almost all habitableworlds were. There was an unbroken tropical ocean and two unbrokenpolar oceans.<br />
  In one set of middle latitudes, there was a more or less serpentinecontinent encircling the world with bays on either side producing anoccasional narrow isthmus. In the other set of middle latitudes, theland surface was broken into three large parts and each of the threewere thicker north-south than the opposite continent was.<br />
  Trevize wished he knew enough climatology to be able to predict,from what he saw, what the temperatures and seasons might be like. Fora moment, he toyed with the idea of having the computer work on theproblem. The trouble was that climate was not the point at issue.<br />
  Much more important was that, once again, the computer detected noradiation that might be of technological origin. What his telescope toldhim was that the planet was not moth-eaten and that there were no signs ofdesert. The land moved backward in various shades of green, but there wereno signs of urban areas on the dayside, no lights on the nightside.<br />
  Was this another planet filled with every kind of life but human?<br />
  He rapped at the door of the other bedroom.<br />
  Bliss? he called out in a loud whisper, and rapped again.<br />
  There was a rustling, and Bliss's voice said, &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Could you come out here? I need your help &quot;<br />
&quot;If you wait just a bit, I'll make myself a bit presentable.&quot;When she finally appeared, she looked as presentable as Trevize hadever seen her. He felt a twinge of annoyance at having been made to wait,however, for it made little difference to him what she looked like. Butthey were friends now, and he suppressed the annoyance.<br />
  She said with a smile and in a perfectly pleasant tone, &quot;What can Ido for you, Trevize?&quot;Trevize waved at the viewscreen. &quot;As you can see, we're passing overthe surface of what looks like a perfectly healthy world with a quitesolid vegetation cover over its land area. No lights at night, however,and no technological radiation. Please listen and tell me if there's anyanimal life. There was one point at which I thought I could see herdsof grazing animals, but I wasn't sure. It might be a case of seeing whatone desperately wants to see.&quot;Bliss &quot;listened.&quot; At least, a curiously intent look came across herface. She said, &quot;Oh yes rich in animal life.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mammalian?&quot;<br />
&quot;Must be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Human?&quot;Now she seemed to concentrate harder. A full minute passed, andthen another, and finally she relaxed. &quot;I can't quite tell. Every oncein a while it seemed to me that I detected a whiff of intelligencesufficiently intense to be considered human. But it was so feeble andso occasional that perhaps I, too, was only sensing what I desperatelywanted to sense. You see &quot;She paused in thought, and Trevize nudged her with a &quot;Well?&quot;She said, &quot;The thing is I seem to detect something else. It is notsomething I'm familiar with, but I don't see how it can be anythingbut &quot;Her face tightened again as she began to &quot;listen&quot; with still greaterintensity.<br />
  Well? said Trevize again.<br />
  She relaxed. &quot;I don't see how it can be anything but robots.&quot;<br />
&quot;Robots!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, and if I detect them, surely I ought to be able to detect humanbeings, too. But I don't.&quot;<br />
&quot;Robots!&quot; said Trevize again, frowning.<br />
  Yes, said Bliss, &quot;and I should judge, in great numbers.&quot;43Pelorat also said &quot;Robots!&quot; in almost exactly Trevize'stone when he was told of them. Then he smiled slightly. &quot;You were right,Golan, and I was wrong to doubt you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't remember your doubting me, Janov.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well, old man, I didn't think I ought to express it. I justthought, in my heart, that it was a mistake to leave Aurora while therewas a chance we might interview some surviving robot. But then it'sclear you knew there would be a richer supply of robots here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all, Janov. I didn't know . I merely chancedit. Bliss tells me their mental fields seem to imply they are fullyfunctioning, and it seems to me they can't very well be fully functioningwithout human beings about for care and maintenance. However, she can'tspot anything human so we're still looking.&quot;Pelorat studied the viewscreen thoughtfully. &quot;It seems to be allforest, doesn't it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mostly forest. But there are clear patches that may be grasslands. Thething is that I see no cities, or any lights at night, or anything butthermal radiation at any time.&quot;<br />
&quot;So no human beings after all?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wonder. Bliss is in the galley trying to concentrate. I've setup an arbitrary prime meridian for the planet which means that it'sdivided into latitude and longitude in the computer. Bliss has a littledevice which she presses whenever she encounters what seems an unusualconcentration of robotic mental activity I suppose you can't say`neuronic activity' in connection with robots or any whiff ofhuman thought. The device is linked to the computer, which thus getsa fix on all the latitudes and longitudes, and we'll let it make thechoice among them and pick a good place for landing.&quot;Pelorat looked uneasy. &quot;Is it wise to leave the matter of choice tothe computer?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not, Janov? It's a very competent computer. Besides, when youhave no basis on which to make a choice yourself, where's the harm inat least considering the computer's choice?&quot;Pelorat brightened up. &quot;There's something to that, Golan. Some of theoldest legends include tales of people making choices by tossing cubesto the ground.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? What does that accomplish?&quot;<br />
&quot;Each face of the cube has some decision onit yes no perhaps postpone and soon. Whichever face happens to come upward on landing would be taken asbearing the advice to be followed. Or they would set a ball rolling abouta slotted disc with different decisions scattered among the slots. Thedecision written on the slot in which the ball ends is to be taken. Somemythologists think such activities represented games of chance ratherthan lotteries, but the two are much the same thing in my opinion.&quot;<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;we're playing a game of chance in choosingour place of landing.&quot;Bliss emerged from the galley in time to hear the last comment. Shesaid, &quot;No game of chance. I pressed several `maybes' and then onesure-fire `yes,' and it's to the `yes' that we'll be going.&quot;<br />
&quot;What made it a `yes'?&quot; asked Trevize.<br />
  I caught a whiff of human thought. Definite. Unmistakable.44It had been raining, for the grass was wet. Overhead,the clouds were scudding by and showing signs of breaking up.<br />
  The Far Star had come to a gentle rest near a small grove oftrees. (In case of wild dogs, Trevize thought, only partly in jest.) Allabout was what looked like pasture land, and coming down from the greaterheight at which a better and wider view had been possible, Trevize hadseen what looked like orchards and grain fields and this time,an unmistakable view of grazing animals.<br />
  There were no structures, however. Nothing artificial, except thatthe regularity of the trees in the orchard and the sharp boundaries thatseparated fields were themselves as artificial as a microwave-receivingpower station would have been.<br />
  Could that level of artificiality have been produced by robots,however? Without human beings?<br />
  Quietly, Trevize was putting on his holsters. This time, he knew thatboth weapons were in working order and that both were fully charged. Fora moment, he caught Bliss's eye and paused.<br />
  She said, &quot;Go ahead. I don't think you'll have any use for them,but I thought as much once before, didn't I?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Would you like to be armed, Janov?&quot;Pelorat shuddered. &quot;No, thank you. Between you and your physicaldefense, and Bliss and her mental defense, I feel in no danger at all. Isuppose it is cowardly of me to hide in your protective shadows, butI can't feel proper shame when I'm too busy feeling grateful that Ineedn't be in a position of possibly having to use force.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I understand. Just don't go anywhere alone. If Blissand I separate, you stay with one of us and don't dash off somewhereunder the spur of a private curiosity.&quot;<br />
&quot;You needn't worry, Trevize,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;I'll see to that.&quot;Trevize stepped out of the ship first. The wind was brisk and justa trifle cool in the aftermath of the rain, but Trevize found thatwelcome. It had probably been uncomfortably warm and humid before therain.<br />
  He took in his breath with surprise. The smell of the planet wasdelightful. Every planet had its own odor, he knew, an odor always strangeand usually distasteful perhaps only because it was strange. Mightnot strange be pleasant as well? Or was this the accident of catching theplanet just after the rain at a particular season of the year. Whicheverit was &quot;Come on,&quot; he called. &quot;It's quite pleasant out here.&quot;Pelorat emerged and said, &quot;Pleasant is definitely the word for it. Doyou suppose it always smells like this?&quot;<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter. Within the hour, we'll be accustomed to the aroma,and our nasal receptors will be sufficiently saturated, for us to smellnothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pity,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  The grass is wet, said Bliss, with a shade of disapproval.<br />
  Why not? After all, it rains on Gaia, too! said Trevize, and as hesaid that a shaft of yellow sunlight reached them momentarily througha small break in the clouds. There would soon be more of it.<br />
  Yes, said Bliss, &quot;but we know when and we're prepared for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Too bad,&quot; said Trevize; &quot;you lose the thrill of the unexpected.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;You're right. I'll try not to be provincial.&quot;Pelorat looked about and said, in a disappointed tone, &quot;There seemsto be nothing about.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only seems to be,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;They're approaching from beyondthat rise.&quot; She looked toward Trevize. &quot;Do you think we ought to go tomeet them?&quot;Trevize shook his head. &quot;No. We've come to meet them across manyparsecs. Let them walk the rest of the way. We'll wait for them here.&quot;Only Bliss could sense the approach until, from the direction of herpointing finger, a figure appeared over the brow of the rise. Then asecond, and a third.<br />
  I believe that is all at the moment, said Bliss.<br />
  Trevize watched curiously. Though he had never seen robots, therewas not a particle of doubt in him that that was what they were. Theyhad the schematic and impressionistic shape of human beings and yet werenot obviously metallic in appearance. The robotic surface was dull andgave the illusion of softness, as though it were covered in plush.<br />
  But how did he know the softness was an illusion? Trevize felt a suddendesire to feel those figures who were approaching so stolidly. If it weretrue that this was a Forbidden World and that spaceships never approachedit and surely that must be so since the sun was not includedin the Galactic map then the Far Star and the people itcarried must represent something the robots had never experienced. Yetthey were reacting with steady certainty, as though they were workingtheir way through a routine exercise.<br />
  Trevize said, in a low voice, &quot;Here we may have information we canget nowhere else in the Galaxy. We could ask them for the location ofEarth with reference to this world, and if they know, they will tellus. Who knows how long these things have functioned and endured? Theymay answer out of personal memory. Think of that.&quot;<br />
&quot;On the other hand,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;they may be recently manufacturedand may know nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Or,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;they may know, but may refuse to tell us.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I suspect they can't refuse unless they've been orderednot to tell us, and why should such orders be issued when surely no oneon this planet could have expected our coming?&quot;At a distance of about three meters, the robots stopped. They saidnothing and made no further movement.<br />
  Trevize, his hand on his blaster, said to Bliss, without taking hiseyes from the robot, &quot;Can you tell whether they are hostile?&quot;<br />
&quot;You'll have to allow for the fact that I have no experience whatsoeverwith their mental workings, Trevize, but I don't detect anything thatseems hostile.&quot;Trevize took his right hand away from the butt of the weapon, butkept it near. He raised his left hand, palm toward the robots, in what hehoped would be recognized as a gesture of peace and said, speaking slowly,&quot;I greet you. We come to this world as friends.&quot;The central robot of the three ducked his head in a kind of abortivebow that might also have been taken as a gesture of peace by an optimist,and replied.<br />
  Trevize's jaw dropped in astonishment. In a world of Galacticcommunication, one did not think of failure in so fundamental aneed. However, the robot did not speak in Galactic Standard or anythingapproaching it. In fact, Trevize could not understand a word.<br />
  45Pelorat's surprise was as great as that of Trevize,but there was an obvious element of pleasure in it, too.<br />
  Isn't that strange? he said.<br />
  Trevize turned to him and said, with more than a touch of asperityin his voice, &quot;It's not strange. It's gibberish.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Not gibberish at all. It's Galactic, but very archaic. Icatch a few words. I could probably understand it easily if it werewritten down. It's the pronunciation that's the real puzzle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, what did it say?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think it told you it didn't understand what you said.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I can't tell what it said, but what I sense ispuzzlement, which fits. That is, if I can trust my analysis of roboticemotion or if there is such a thing as robotic emotion.&quot;Speaking very slowly, and with difficulty, Pelorat said something,and the three robots ducked their head in unison.<br />
  What was that? said Trevize.<br />
  Pelorat said, &quot;I said I couldn't speak well, but I would try. I askedfor a little time. Dear me, old chap, this is fearfully interesting.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fearfully disappointing,&quot; muttered Trevize.<br />
  You see, said Pelorat, &quot;every habitable planet in the Galaxy managesto work out its own variety of Galactic so that there are a milliondialects that are sometimes barely intercomprehensible, but they're allpulled together by the development of Galactic Standard. Assuming thisworld to have been isolated for twenty thousand years, the language wouldordinarily drift so far from that of the rest of the Galaxy as to be anentirely different language. That it isn't may be because the world hasa social system that depends upon robots which can only understand thelanguage as spoken in the fashion in which they were programmed. Ratherthan keep reprogramming, the language remained static and we now havewhat is to us merely a very archaic form of Galactic.&quot;<br />
&quot;There's an example,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;of how a robotized society canbe held static and made, to turn degenerate.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, my dear fellow,&quot; protested Pelorat, &quot;keeping a languagerelatively unchanged is not necessarily a sign of degeneration. There areadvantages to it. Documents preserved for centuries and millennia retaintheir meaning and give greater longevity and authority to historicalrecords. In the rest of the Galaxy, the language of Imperial edicts ofthe time of Hari Seldon already begins to sound quaint.&quot;<br />
&quot;And do you know this archaic Galactic?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not to say know , Golan. It's just that in studyingancient myths and legends I've picked up the trick of it. The vocabularyis not entirely different, but it is inflected differently, and thereare idiomatic expressions we don't use any longer and, as I have said,the pronunciation is totally changed. I can act as interpreter, but notas a very good one.&quot;Trevize heaved a tremulous sigh. &quot;A small stroke of good fortune isbetter than none. Carry on, Janov.&quot;Pelorat turned to the robots, waited a moment, then looked back atTrevize. &quot;What am I supposed to say?&quot;<br />
&quot;Let's go all the way. Ask them where Earth is.&quot;Pelorat said the words one at a time, with exaggerated gestures ofhis hands.<br />
  The robots looked at each other and made a few sounds. The middleone then spoke to Pelorat, who replied while moving his hands apart asthough he were stretching a length of rubber. The robot responded byspacing his words as carefully as Pelorat had.<br />
  Pelorat said to Trevize, &quot;I'm not sure I'm getting across what I meanby `Earth.' I suspect they think I'm referring to some region on theirplanet and they say they don't know of any such region.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do they use the name of this planet, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;The closest I can come to what I think they are using as the name is`Solaria.'&quot;<br />
&quot;Have you ever heard of it in your legends?&quot;<br />
&quot;No any more than I had ever heard of Aurora.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, ask them if there is any place named Earth in thesky among the stars. Point upward.&quot;Again an exchange, and finally Pelorat turned and said, &quot;All I canget from them, Golan, is that there are no places in the sky.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Ask those robots how old they are; or rather, how longthey have been functioning.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know how to say `functioning,'&quot; said Pelorat, shaking hishead. In fact, I'm not sure if I can say `how old.' I'm not a very good interpreter.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do the best you can, Pel dear,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  And after several exchanges, Pelorat said, &quot;They've been functioningfor twenty-six years.&quot;<br />
&quot;Twenty-six years,&quot; muttered Trevize in disgust. &quot;They're hardlyolder than you are, Bliss.&quot;Bliss said, with sudden pride, &quot;It so happens &quot;<br />
&quot;I know. You're Gaia, which is thousands of years old. In anycase, these robots cannot talk about Earth from personal experience,and their memory-banks clearly do not include anything not necessary totheir functioning. So they know nothing about astronomy.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;There may be other robots somewhere on the planet thatare primordial, perhaps.&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt it,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but ask them, if you can find the wordsfor it, Janov.&quot;This time there was quite a long conversation and Pelorat eventuallybroke it off with a flushed face and a clear air of frustration.<br />
  Golan, he said, &quot;I don't understand part of what they're trying tosay, but I gather that the older robots are used for manual labor anddon't know anything. If this robot were a human, I'd say he spoke ofthe older robots with contempt. These three are house robots, they say,and are not allowed to grow old before being replaced. They're the oneswho really know things their words, not mine.&quot;<br />
&quot;They don't know much,&quot; growled Trevize. &quot;At least of the things wewant to know.&quot;<br />
&quot;I now regret,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that we left Aurora so hurriedly. Ifwe had found a robot survivor there, and we surely would have, sincethe very first one I encountered still had a spark of life left in it,they would know of Earth through personal memory.&quot;<br />
&quot;Provided their memories were intact, Janov,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Wecan always go back there and, if we have to, dog packs or not, wewill. But if these robots are only a couple of decades old,there must be those who manufacture them, and the manufacturers must behuman, I should think.&quot; He turned to Bliss. &quot;Are you sure you sensed &quot;But she raised a hand to stop him and there was a strained and intentlook on her face. &quot;Coming now,&quot; she said, in a low voice.<br />
  Trevize turned his face toward the rise and there, first appearingfrom behind it, and then striding toward them, was the unmistakablefigure of a human being. His complexion was pale and his hair light andlong, standing out slightly from the sides of his head. His face wasgrave but quite young in appearance. His bare arms and legs were notparticularly muscled.<br />
  The robots stepped aside for him, and he advanced till he stood intheir midst.<br />
  He then spoke in a clear, pleasant voice and his words, although usedarchaically, were in Galactic Standard, and easily understood.<br />
  Greetings, wanderers from space, he said. &quot;What would you withmy robots?&quot;46Trevize did not cover himself with glory. He saidfoolishly, &quot;You speak Galactic?&quot;The Solarian said, with a grim smile, &quot;And why not, since I am notmute?&quot;<br />
&quot;But these?&quot; Trevize gestured toward the robots.<br />
  These are robots. They speak our language, as I do. But I amSolarian and hear the hyperspatial communications of the worlds beyondso that I have learned your way of speaking, as have my predecessors. Mypredecessors have left descriptions of the language, but I constantlyhear new words and expressions that change with the years, as though youSettlers can settle worlds, but not words. How is it you are surprisedat my understanding of your language?&quot;I should not have been, said Trevize. &quot;I apologize. It was justthat speaking to the robots, I had not thought to hear Galactic onthis world.&quot;He studied the Solarian. He was wearing a thin white robe, drapedloosely over his shoulder, with large openings for his arms. It was openin front, exposing a bare chest and loincloth below. Except for a pairof light sandals, he wore nothing else.<br />
  It occurred to Trevize that he could not tell whether the Solarianwas male or female. The breasts were male certainly but the chest washairless and the thin loincloth showed no bulge of any kind.<br />
  He turned to Bliss and said in a low voice, &quot;This might still be arobot, but very like a human being in &quot;Bliss said, her lips hardly moving, &quot;The mind is that of a human being,not a robot.&quot;The Solarian said, &quot;Yet you have not answered my original question. Ishall excuse the failure and put it down to your surprise. I now ask againand you must not fail a second time. What would you with my robots?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;We are travelers who seek information to reach ourdestination. We asked your robots for information that would help us,but they lacked the knowledge.&quot;<br />
&quot;What is the information you seek? Perhaps I can help you.&quot;<br />
&quot;We seek the location of Earth. Could you tell us that?&quot;The Solarian's eyebrows lifted. &quot;I would have thought that yourfirst object of curiosity would have been myself. I will supply thatinformation although you have not asked for it. I am Sarton Bander andyou stand upon the Bander estate, which stretches as far as your eye cansee in every direction and far beyond. I cannot say that you are welcomehere, for in coming here, you have violated a trust. You are the firstSettlers to touch down upon Solaria in many thousands of years and, asit turns out, you have come here merely to inquire as to the best wayof reaching another world. In the old days, Settlers, you and your shipwould have been destroyed on sight.&quot;<br />
&quot;That would be a barbaric way of treating people who mean no harmand offer none,&quot; said Trevize cautiously.<br />
  I agree, but when members of an expanding society set foot upon aninoffensive and static one, that mere touch is filled with potentialharm. While we feared that harm, we were ready to destroy those who cameat the instant of their coming. Since we no longer have reason to fear,we are, as you see, ready to talk.Trevize said, &quot;I appreciate the information you have offered us sofreely, and yet you failed to answer the question I did ask. I willrepeat it. Could you tell us the location of the planet Earth?&quot;<br />
&quot;By Earth, I take it you mean the world on which the human species,and the various species of plants and animals&quot; his hand movedgracefully about as though to indicate all the surroundings aboutthem &quot;originated.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I do, sir.&quot;A queer look of repugnance flitted over the Solarian's face. He said,&quot;Please address me simply as Bander, if you must use a form of address. Donot address me by any word that includes a sign of gender. I am neithermale nor female. I am whole .&quot;Trevize nodded (he had been right). &quot;As you wish, Bander. What, then,is the location of Earth, the world of origin of all of us?&quot;Bander said, &quot;I do not know. Nor do I wish to know. If I did know,or if I could find out, it would do you no good, for Earth no longerexists as a world. Ah,&quot; he went on, stretching out his arms. &quot;Thesun feels good. I am not often on the surface, and never when the sun doesnot show itself. My robots were sent to greet you while the sun was yethiding behind the clouds. I followed only when the clouds cleared.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why is it that Earth no longer exists as a world?&quot; said Trevizeinsistently, steeling himself for the tale of radioactivity onceagain.<br />
  Bander, however, ignored the question or, rather, put it to one sidecarelessly. &quot;The story is too long,&quot; he said. &quot;You told me that you camewith no intent of harm.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is correct.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why then did you come armed?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is merely a precaution. I did not know what I might meet.&quot;<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter. Your little weapons represent no danger tome. Yet I am curious. I have, of course, heard much of your arms, andof your curiously barbaric history that seems to depend so entirely uponarms. Even so, I have never actually seen a weapon. May I see yours?&quot;Trevize took a step backward. &quot;I'm afraid not, Bander.&quot;Bander seemed amused. &quot;I asked only out of politeness. I need nothave asked at all.&quot;It held out its hand and from Trevize's right holster, there emergedhis blaster, while from his left holster, there rose up his neuronicwhip. Trevize snatched at his weapons but felt his arms held back asthough by stiffly elastic bonds. Both Pelorat and Bliss started forwardand it was clear that they were held as well.<br />
  Bander said, &quot;Don't bother trying to interfere. You cannot.&quot; Theweapons flew to its hands and it looked them over carefully. &quot;This one,&quot;it said, indicating the blaster, &quot;seems to be a microwave beamer thatproduces heat, thus exploding any fluid-containing body. The other ismore subtle, and, I must confess, I do not see at a glance what it isintended to do. However, since you mean no harm and offer no harm, youdon't need arms. I can, and I do, bleed the energy content of the unitsof each weapon. That leaves them harmless unless you use one or the otheras a club, and they would be clumsy indeed if used for that purpose.&quot;The Solarian released the weapons and again they drifted throughthe air, this time back toward Trevize. Each settled neatly into itsholster.<br />
  Trevize, feeling himself released, pulled out his blaster, but therewas no need to use it. The contact hung loosely, and the energy unithad clearly been totally drained. That was precisely the case with theneuronic whip as well.<br />
  He looked up at Bander, who said, smiling, &quot;You are quite helpless,Outworlder. I can as easily, if I so desired, destroy your ship and,of course, you.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense. You were just right. I was afraid that you had been keptactive and drained by that young woman, but you assured me you hadnot. That it true, isn't it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Have I acted like someone who was half-sated to begin with?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you did not,&quot; and her laughter boomed.<br />
  Are you still thinking of Psychic Probes?She laughed again. &quot;Are you mad? Would I want to lose younow ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet it would be better if you lost me temporarily &quot;<br />
&quot;What!&quot; She frowned.<br />
  If I were to stay here permanently, my my dear, how longwould it be before eyes would begin to watch, and mouths would begin towhisper? It I went off on my mission, however, I would naturally returnperiodically to, report, and it would then be only natural that we shouldbe closeted together for a while and my mission is important.She thought about that, scratching idly at her right hip. Then shesaid, &quot;I suppose you're right. I hate the thought but I supposeyou're right.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you need not think I would not come back,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I amnot so witless as to forget what I would have waiting for me here.&quot;She smiled at him, touched his cheek gently, and said, looking intohis eyes, &quot;Did you find it pleasant, love?&quot;<br />
&quot;Much more than pleasant, dear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet you are a Foundationer. A man in the prime of youth fromTerminus itself. You must be accustomed to all sorts of women with allsoul skills &quot;<br />
&quot;I have encountered nothing nothing  in theleast like you,&quot; said Trevize, with a forcefulness that came easily tosomeone who was but telling the truth, after all.<br />
  Lizalor said complacently, &quot;Well, if you say so. Still, old habitsdie hard, you know, and I don't think I could bring myself to trust aman's word without some sort of surety. You and your friend, Pelorat,might conceivably go on this mission of yours once I hear about it andapprove, but I will keep the young woman here. She will be well treated,never fear, but I presume your Dr. Pelorat will want her, and he willsee to it that there are frequent returns to Comporellon, even if yourenthusiasm for this mission you to stay away too long.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, Lizalor, that's impossible.&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed?&quot; Suspicion at once seeped into her eyes. &quot;Why impossible? Forwhat purpose would you need the woman?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not for sex. I told you that, and I told you truthfully. She isPelorat's and I have no interest in her. Besides, I'm sure she'd breakin two if she attempted what you so triumphantly carried through.&quot;Lizalor almost smiled, but repressed it and said severely, &quot;What isit to you, then, if she remains on Comporellon?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because she is of essential importance to our mission. That is whywe must have her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, then, what is your mission? It is time you told me.&quot;Trevize hesitated very briefly. It would have to be the truth. Hecould think of no lie as effective.<br />
  Listen to me, he said. &quot;Comporellon may be an old world, even amongthe oldest, but it can't be the oldest. Human life did notoriginate here. The earliest human beings reached here from some otherworld, and perhaps human life didn't originate there either, but camefrom still another and still older world. Eventually, though, thoseprobings back into time must stop, and we must reach the first world,the world of human origins. I am seeking Earth.&quot;The change that suddenly came over Mitza Lizalor staggered him.<br />
  Her eyes had widened, her breathing took on a sudden urgency, andevery muscle seemed to stiffen as she lay there in bed. Her arms shotupward rigidly, and the first two fingers of both hands crossed.<br />
  You named it, she whispered hoarsely.<br />
  23She didn't say anything after that; she didn't look athim. Her arms slowly came down, her legs swung over the side of the bed,and she sat up, back to him. Trevize lay where he was, frozen.<br />
  He could hear, in memory, the words of Munn Li Compor, as theystood there in the empty tourist center at Sayshell. He could hear himsaying of his own ancestral planet the one that Trevize was onnow &quot;They're superstitious about it. Every time they mention theword, they lift up both hands with first and second fingers crossed toward off misfortune.&quot;How useless to remember after the fact.<br />
  What should I have said, Mitza? he muttered.<br />
  She shook her head slightly, stood up, stalked toward and then througha door. It closed behind her and, after a moment, there was the soundof water running.<br />
  He had no recourse but to wait, bare, undignified, wondering whetherto join her in the shower, and then quite certain he had better not. Andbecause, in a way, he felt the shower denied him, he at once experienceda growing need for one.<br />
  She emerged at last and silently began to select clothing.<br />
  He said, &quot;Do you mind if I &quot;She said nothing, and he took silence for consent. He tried to strideinto the room in a strong and masculine way but he felt uncommonly ashe had in those days when his mother, offended by some misbehavior onhis part, offered him no punishment but silence, causing him to shrivelin discomfort.<br />
  He looked about inside the smoothly walled cubicle that wasbare-completely bare. He looked more minutely. There wasnothing.<br />
  He opened the door again, thrust his head out, and said, &quot;Listen,how are you supposed to start the shower?&quot;She put down the deodorant (at least, Trevize guessed that was itsfunction), strode to the shower-room and, still without looking at him,pointed. Trevize followed the finger and noted a spot on the wall that wasround and faintly pink, barely colored, as though the designer resentedhaving to spoil the starkness of the white, for no reason more importantthan to give a hint of function.<br />
  Trevize shrugged lightly, leaned toward the wall, and touched thespot. Presumably that was what one had to do, for in a moment a deluge offine-sprayed water struck him from every direction. Gasping, he touchedthe spot again and it stopped.<br />
  He opened the door, knowing he looked several degrees more undignifiedstill as he shivered hard enough to make it difficult to articulatewords. He croaked, &quot;How do you get hot water?&quot;Now she looked at him and, apparently, his appearance overcame heranger (or fear, or whatever emotion was victimizing her) for she snickeredand then, without warning, boomed her laughter at him.<br />
  What hot water? she said. &quot;Do you think we're going to wastethe energy to heat water for washing? That's good mild water you had,water with the chill taken off. What more do you want? You sludge-softTerminians! Get back in there and wash!&quot;Trevize hesitated, but not for long, since it was clear he had nochoice in the matter.<br />
  With remarkable reluctance he touched the pink spot again and this timesteeled his body for the icy spray. Mild water? He foundsuds forming on his body and he rubbed hastily here, there, everywhere,judging it to be the wash cycle and suspecting it would not last long.<br />
  Then came the rinse cycle. Ah, warm Well, perhaps not warm, butnot quite as cold, and definitely feeling warm to his thoroughly chilledbody. Then, even as he was considering touching the contact spot againto stop the water, and was wondering how Lizalor had come out dry whenthere was absolutely no towel or towel-substitute in the place thewater stopped. It was followed by a blast of air that would have certainlybowled him over if it had not come from various directions equally.<br />
  It was hot; almost too hot. It took far less energy, Trevize knew,to heat air than to heat water. The hot air steamed the water off himand, in a few minutes, he was able to step out as dry as though he hadnever encountered water in his life.<br />
  Lizalor seemed to have recovered completely. &quot;Do you feel well?&quot;<br />
&quot;Pretty well,&quot; said Trevize. Actually, he felt astonishinglycomfortable. &quot;All I had to do was prepare myself for the temperature. Youdidn't tell me &quot;<br />
&quot;Sludge-soft,&quot; said Lizalor, with mild contempt.<br />
  He borrowed her deodorant, then began to dress, conscious of the factthat she had fresh underwear and he did not. He said, &quot;What should Ihave called that world?&quot;She said, &quot;We refer to it as the Oldest.&quot;He said, &quot;How was I to know the name I used was forbidden? Did youtell me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;How was I to know to ask?&quot;<br />
&quot;You know now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm bound to forget.&quot;<br />
&quot;You had better not.&quot;<br />
&quot;What's the difference?&quot; Trevize felt his temper rising. &quot;It's justa word, a sound.&quot;Lizalor said darkly, &quot;There are words one doesn't say. Do you sayevery word you know under all circumstances?&quot;<br />
&quot;Some words are vulgar, some are inappropriate, some under particularcircumstances would be hurtful. Which is that word I used?&quot;Lizalor said, &quot;It's a sad word, a solemn word. It represents a worldthat was ancestor to us all and that now doesn't exist. It's tragic,and we feel it because it was near to us. We prefer not to speak of itor, if we must, not to use its name.&quot;<br />
&quot;And the crossing of fingers at me? How does that relieve the hurtand sadness?&quot;Lizalor's face flushed. &quot;That was an automatic reaction, and I don'tthank you for forcing it on me. There are people who believe that theword, even the thought, brings on misfortune and that is how theyward it off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you, too, believe crossing fingers wards off misfortune?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Well, yes, in a way. It makes me uneasy if I don't doit.&quot; She didn't look at him. Then, as though eager to shift the subject,she said quickly, &quot;And how is that black-haired woman of yours of theessence with respect to your mission to reach that world youmentioned.&quot;<br />
&quot;Say `the Oldest.' Or would you rather not even say that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I would rather not discuss it at all, but I asked you a question.&quot;<br />
&quot;I believe that her people reached their present world as emigrantsfrom the Oldest.&quot;<br />
&quot;As we did,&quot; said Lizalor proudly.<br />
  But her people have traditions of some sort which she says are thekey to understanding the Oldest, but only if we reach it and can studyits records.&quot;She is lying.&quot;Perhaps, but we must check it out.&quot;If you have this woman with her problematical knowledge, and if youwant to reach the Oldest with her, why did you come to Comporellon?&quot;To find the location of the Oldest. I had a friend once, who, likemyself, was a Foundationer. He, however, was descended from Comporellianancestors and he assured me that much of the history of the Oldest waswell known, on Comporellon.&quot;Did he indeed? And did he tell you any of itshistory?&quot;Yes, said Trevize, reaching for the truth again. &quot;He said thatthe Oldest was a dead world, entirely radioactive. He did not know why,but he thought that it might be the result of nuclear explosions. In awar, perhaps.&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot; said Lizalor explosively.<br />
  No, there was no war? Or no, the Oldest is not radioactive?&quot;It is radioactive, but there was no war.&quot;Then how did it become radioactive? It could not have been radioactiveto begin with since human life began on the Oldest. There would havebeen no life on it ever.Lizalor seemed to hesitate. She stood erect, and was breathing deeply,almost gasping. She said, &quot;It was a punishment. It was a world that usedrobots. Do you know what robots are?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;They had robots and for that they were punished. Every world thathas had robots has been punished and no longer exists.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who punished them, Lizalor?&quot;<br />
&quot;He Who Punishes. The forces of history. I don't know.&quot; She looked awayfrom him, uncomfortable, then said, in a lower voice, &quot;Ask others.&quot;<br />
&quot;I would like to, but whom do I ask? Are there those on Comporellonwho have studied primeval history?&quot;<br />
&quot;There are. They are not popular with us with the averageComporellian but the Foundation, your Foundation,insists on intellectual freedom, as they call it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not a bad insistence, in my opinion,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  All is bad that is imposed from without, said Lizalor.<br />
  Trevize shrugged. There was no purpose in arguing the matter. He sald,&quot;My friend, Dr. Pelorat, is himself a primeval historian of a sort. Hewould, I'm sure, like to meet his Comporellian colleagues. Can youarrange that, Lizalor?&quot;She nodded. &quot;There is a historian named Vasil Deniador, who is basedat the University here in the city. He does not teach class, but he maybe able to tell you what you want to know.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why doesn't he teach class?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's not that he is forbidden; it's just that students do not electhis course.&quot;<br />
&quot;I presume,&quot; said Trevize, trying not to say it sardonically, &quot;thatthe students are encouraged not to elect it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why should they want to? He is a Skeptic. We have them, youknow. There are always individuals who pit their minds against thegeneral modes of thought and who are arrogant enough to feel that theyalone are right and that the many are wrong.&quot;<br />
&quot;Might it not be that that could actually be so in some cases?&quot;<br />
&quot;Never!&quot; snapped Lizalor, with a firmness of belief that made itquite clear that no further discussion in that direction would be of anyuse. &quot;And for all his Skepticism, he will be forced to tell you exactlywhat any Comporellian would tell you.&quot;<br />
&quot;And that is?&quot;<br />
&quot;That if you search for the Oldest, you will not find it.&quot;24In the private quarters assigned them, Pelorat listenedto Trevize thoughtfully, his long solemn face expressionless, then said,&quot;Vasil Deniador? I do not recall having heard of him, but it may be thatback on the ship I will find papers by him in my library.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you haven't heard of him? Think!&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  I don't recall, at the moment, having heard of him, said Peloratcautiously, &quot;but after all, my dear chap, there must be hundreds ofestimable scholars I haven't heard of; or have, but can't remember.&quot;<br />
&quot;Still, he can't be first-class, or you would have heard of him.&quot;<br />
&quot;The study of Earth &quot;<br />
&quot;Practice saying `the Oldest,' Janov. It would complicate mattersotherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;The study of the Oldest,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;is not a well-rewarded nichein the corridors of learning, so that first-class scholars, even in thefield of primeval history, would not tend to find their way there. Or,if we put it the other way around, those who are already there do notmake enough of a name for themselves in an uninterested world to beconsidered first-class, even if they were. I am notfirst-class in anyone's estimation, I am sure.&quot;Bliss said tenderly, &quot;In mine, Pel.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, certainly in yours, my dear,&quot; said Pelorat, smiling slightly,&quot;but you are not judging me in my capacity as scholar.&quot;It was almost night now, going by the clock, and Trevize felt himselfgrow slightly impatient, as he always did when Bliss and Pelorat tradedendearments.<br />
  He said, &quot;I'll try to arrange our seeing this Deniador tomorrow,but if he knows as little about the matter as the Minister does, we'renot going to be much better off than we are now.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;He may be able to lead us to someone more useful.&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt it. This world's attitude toward Earth but I had betterpractice speaking of it elliptically, too. This world's attitude towardthe Oldest is a foolish and superstitious one.&quot; He turned away. &quot;Butit's been a rough day and we ought to think of an evening meal ifwe can face their uninspired cookery and then begin thinking ofgetting some sleep. Have you two learned how to use the shower?&quot;<br />
&quot;My dear fellow,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;we have been very kindlytreated. We've received all sorts of instructions, most of which wedidn't need.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Listen, Trevize. What about the ship?&quot;<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Is the Comporellian government confiscating it?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I don't think they will.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah. Very pleasant. Why aren't they?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because I persuaded the Minister to change her mind.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Astonishing. She didn't seem a particularly persuadableindividual to me.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I don't know. It was clear from the texture of her mindthat she was attracted to Trevize.&quot;Trevize looked at Bliss with sudden exasperation. &quot;Did you do that,Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean, Trevize?&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean tamper with her &quot;<br />
&quot;I didn't tamper. However, when I noted that she was attracted toyou, I couldn't resist just snapping an inhibition or two. It was avery small thing to do. Those inhibitions might have snapped anyway,and it seemed to be important to make certain that she was filled withgood will toward you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good will? It was more than that! She softened, yes, butpost-coitally.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Surely you don't mean, old man &quot;<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; said Trevize testily. &quot;She may be past her first youth,but she knew the art well. She was no beginner, I assure you. Nor will Iplay the gentleman and lie on her behalf. It was her idea thanksto Bliss's fiddling with her inhibitions and I was not in aposition to refuse, even if that thought had occurred to me, which itdidn't. Come, Janov, don't stand there looking puritanical. It'sbeen months since I've had an opportunity. You've &quot; And he wavedhis hand vaguely in Bliss's direction.<br />
  Believe me, Golan, said Pelorat, embarrassed, &quot;if you areinterpreting my expression as puritanical, you mistake me. I have noobjection.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;But she is puritanical. I meant to makeher warm toward you; I did not count on a sexual paroxysm.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;But that is exactly what you brought on, my littleinterfering Bliss. It may be necessary for the Minister to play thepuritan in public, but if so, that seems merely to stoke the fires.&quot;<br />
&quot;And so, provided you scratch the itch, she will betray theFoundation &quot;<br />
&quot;She would have done that in any case,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;She wantedthe ship &quot; He broke off, and said in a whisper, &quot;Are we beingoverheard?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;No!&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
&quot;It is certain. It is impossible to impinge upon the mind of Gaia inany unauthorized fashion without Gaia being aware of it.&quot;<br />
&quot;In that case, Comporellon wants the ship for itself a valuableaddition to its fleet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Surely, the Foundation would not allow that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Comporellon does not intend to have the Foundation know.&quot;Bliss sighed. &quot;There are your Isolates. The Minister intends tobetray the Foundation on behalf of Comporellon and, in return for sex,will promptly betray Comporellon, too. And as for Trevize, he willgladly sell his body's services as a way of inducing the betrayal. Whatanarchy there is in this Galaxy of yours. What chaos .&quot;Trevize said coldly, &quot;You are wrong, young woman &quot;<br />
&quot;In what I have just said, I am not a young woman, I am Gaia. I amall of Gaia.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then you are wrong, Gaia . I did not sell my body'sservices. I gave them gladly. I enjoyed it and did no one harm. As forthe consequences, they turned out well from my standpoint and I acceptthat. And if Comporellon wants the ship for its own purposes, who is tosay who is right in this matter? It is a Foundation ship, but it wasgiven to me to search for Earth. It is mine then until I complete thesearch and I feel that the Foundation has no right to go back on itsagreement. As for Comporellon, it does not enjoy Foundation domination,so it dreams of independence. In its own eyes, it is correct to do soand to deceive the Foundation, for that is not an act of treason to thembut an act of patriotism. Who knows?&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly. Who knows? In a Galaxy of anarchy, how is it possible to sortout reasonable actions from unreasonable ones? How decide between rightand wrong, good and evil, justice and crime, useful and useless? Andhow do you explain the Minister's betrayal of her own government, whenshe lets you keep the ship? Does she long for personal independencefrom an oppressive world? Is she a traitor or a personal one-womanself-patriot?&quot;<br />
&quot;To be truthful,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;I don't know that she was willing tolet me have my ship simply because she was grateful to me for the pleasureI gave her. I believe she made that decision only when I told her I wassearching for the Oldest. It is a world of ill-omen to her and we andthe ship that carries us, by searching for it, have become ill-omened,too. It is my feeling that she feet/ she incurred the ill-omen for herselfand her world by attempting to take the ship, which she may, by now,be viewing with horror. Perhaps she feels that by allowing us and ourship to leave and go about our business, she is averting the misfortunefrom Comporellon and is, in that way, performing a patriotic act.&quot;<br />
&quot;If that were so, which I doubt, Trevize, superstition is the springof the action. Do you admire that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I neither admire nor condemn. Superstition always directs action inthe absence of knowledge. The Foundation believes in the Seldon Plan,though no one in our realm can understand it, interpret its details,or use it to predict. We follow blindly out of ignorance and faith,and isn't that superstition?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, it might be.&quot;<br />
&quot;And Gaia, too. You believe I have given the correct decision injudging that Gaia should absorb the Galaxy into one large organism, butyou do not know why I should be right, or how safe it would be for you tofollow that decision. You are willing to go along only out of ignoranceand faith, and are even annoyed with me for trying to find evidencethat will remove the ignorance and make mere faith unnecessary. Isn'tthat superstition?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think he has you there, Bliss,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;Not so. He will either find nothing at all in this search,or he will find something that confirms his decision.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;And to back up that belief, you have only ignoranceand faith. In other words, superstition!&quot;25Vasil Deniador was a small man, little of feature, with a way oflooking up by raising his eyes without raising his head. This, combinedwith the brief smiles that periodically lit his face, gave him theappearance of laughing silently at the world.<br />
  His office was long and narrow, filled with tapes that seemed tobe in wild disorder, not because there was any definite evidence forthat, but because they were not evenly placed in their recesses so thatthey gave the shelves a snaggle-toothed appearance. The three seats heindicated for his visitors were not matched and showed signs of havingbeen recently, and imperfectly, dusted.<br />
  He said, &quot;Janov Pelorat, Golan Trevize, and Bliss. I do nothave your second name, madam.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss,&quot; she said, &quot;is all I am usually called,&quot; and sat down.<br />
  It is enough after all, said Deniador, twinkling at her. &quot;You areattractive enough to be forgiven if you had no name at all.&quot;All were sitting now. Deniador said, &quot;I have heard of you, Dr. Pelorat,though we have never corresponded. You are a Foundationer, are younot? From Terminus?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, Dr. Deniador.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you, Councilman Trevize. I seem to have heard that recently youwere expelled from the Council and exiled. I don't think I have everunderstood why.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not expelled, sir. I am still a member of the Council although Idon't know when I will take up my duties again. Nor exiled, quite. Iwas assigned a mission, concerning which we wish to consult you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Happy to try to help,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;And the blissful lady? Isshe from Terminus, too.&quot;Trevize interposed quickly. &quot;She is from elsewhere, Doctor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, a strange world, this Elsewhere. A most unusual collection ofhuman beings are native to it. But since two of you are from theFoundation's capital at Terminus, and the third is an attractive youngwoman, and Mitza Lizalor is not known for her affection for eithercategory, how is it that she recommends you to my care so warmly?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;to get rid of us. The sooner you help us,you see, the sooner we will leave Comporellon.&quot;Deniador eyed Trevize with interest (again the twinkling smile) andsaid, &quot;Of course, a vigorous young man such as yourself might attracther whatever his origin. She plays the role of cold vestal well, butnot perfectly.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know nothing about that,&quot; said Trevize stiffly.<br />
  And you had better not. In public, at least. But I am a Skepticand I am professionally unattuned to believing in surfaces. So come,Councilman, what is your mission? Let me find out if I can help you.Trevize said, &quot;In this, Dr. Pelorat is our spokesman.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have no objection to that,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;Dr. Pelorat?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;To put it at the simplest, dear Doctor, I have allmy mature life attempted to penetrate to the basic core of knowledgeconcerning the world on which the human species originated, and I wassent out along with my good friend, Golan Trevize although, tobe sure, I did not know him at the time to find, if we could,the uh Oldest, I believe you call it.&quot;<br />
&quot;The Oldest?&quot; said Deniador. &quot;I take it you mean Earth.&quot;Pelorat's jaw dropped. Then he said, with a slight stutter, &quot;I wasunder the impression that is, I was given to understand thatone did not &quot;He looked at Trevize, rather helplessly.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;Minister Lizalor told me that that word was not usedon Comporellon.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean she did this?&quot; Deniador's mouth turned downward, his nosescrewed up, and he thrust his arms vigorously forward, crossing thefirst two fingers on each hand.<br />
  Yes, said Trevize. &quot;That's what I mean.&quot;Deniador relaxed and laughed. &quot;Nonsense, gentlemen. We do it as amatter of habit, and in the backwoods they may be serious about it but,on the whole, it doesn't matter. I don't know any Comporellian whowouldn't say `Earth' when annoyed or startled. It's the most commonvulgarism we have.&quot;<br />
&quot;Vulgarism?&quot; said Pelorat faintly.<br />
  Or expletive, if you prefer.&quot;Nevertheless, said Trevize, &quot;the Minister seemed quite upset whenI used the word.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well, she's a mountain woman.&quot;<br />
&quot;What does that mean, sir?&quot;<br />
&quot;What it says. Mitza Lizalor is from the Central Mountain Range. Thechildren out there are brought up in what is called the good old-fashionedway, which means that no matter how well educated they become you cannever knock those crossed fingers out of them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then the word `Earth' doesn't bother you at all, does it,Doctor?&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  Not at all, dear lady. I am a Skeptic.Trevize said, &quot;I know what the word `skeptic' means in Galactic,but how do you use the word?&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly as you do, Councilman. I accept only what I am forcedto accept by reasonably reliable evidence, and keep that acceptancetentative pending the arrival of further evidence. That doesn't makeus popular.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  We wouldn't be popular anywhere. Where is the world whose people don'tprefer a comfortable, warm, and well-worn belief, however illogical,to the chilly winds of uncertainty? Consider how you believe inthe Seldon Plan without evidence.&quot;Yes, said Trevize, studying his finger ends. &quot;I put that forwardyesterday as an example, too.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;May I return to the subject, old fellow? What is knownabout Earth that a Skeptic would accept?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;Very little. We can assume that there is a singleplanet on which the human species developed, because it is unlikelyin the extreme that the same species, so nearly identical as to beinterfertile, would develop on a number of worlds, or even on just two,independently. We can choose to call this world of origin Earth. Thebelief is general, here, that Earth exists in this corner of the Galaxy,for the worlds here are unusually old and it is likely that the firstworlds to be settled were close to Earth rather than far from it.&quot;<br />
&quot;And has the Earth any unique characteristics aside from being theplanet of origin?&quot; asked Pelorat eagerly.<br />
  Do you have something in mind? said Deniador, with his quicksmile.<br />
  I'm thinking of its satellite, which some call the moon. That wouldbe unusual, wouldn't it?&quot;That's a leading question, Dr. Pelorat. You may be putting thoughtsinto my mind.&quot;I do not say what it is that would make the moon unusual.&quot;Its size, of course. Am I right? Yes, I see I am. All thelegends of Earth speak of its vast array of living species and of itsvast satellite one that is some three thousand to three thousandfive hundred kilometers in diameter. The vast array of life is easyto accept since it would naturally have come about through biologicalevolution, if what we know of the process is accurate. A giant satelliteis more difficult to accept. No other inhabited world in the Galaxy hassuch a satellite. Large satellites are invariably associated with theuninhabited and uninhabitable gas-giants. As a Skeptic, then, I prefernot to accept the existence of the moon.Pelorat said, &quot;If Earth is unique in its possession of millionsof species, might it not also be unique in its possession of a giantsatellite? One uniqueness might imply the other.&quot;Deniador smiled. &quot;I don't see how the presence of millions of specieson Earth could create a giant satellite out of nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;But the other way around Perhaps a giant satellite could helpcreate the millions of species.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't see how that could be either.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;What about the story of Earth's radioactivity?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is universally told; universally believed.&quot;<br />
&quot;But,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;Earth could not have been so radioactive as topreclude life in the billions of years when it supported life. How didit become radioactive? A nuclear war?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is the most common opinion, Councilman Trevize.&quot;<br />
&quot;From the manner in which you say that, I gather you don't believeit.&quot;<br />
&quot;There is no evidence that such a war took place. Common belief,even universal belief, is not, in itself, evidence.&quot;<br />
&quot;What else might have happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;There is no evidence that anything happened. The radioactivity mightbe as purely invented a legend as the large satellite.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;What is the generally accepted story of Earth'shistory? I have, during my professional career, collected a large numberof origin-legends, many of them involving a world called Earth, or somename very much like that. I have none from Comporellon, nothing beyondthe vague mention of a Benbally who might have come from nowhere forall that Comporellian legends say.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's not surprising. We don't usually export our legends and I'mastonished you have found references even to Benbally. Superstition,again.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you are not superstitious and you would not hesitate to talkabout it, would you?&quot;<br />
&quot;That's correct,&quot; said the small historian, casting his eyes upwardat Pelorat. &quot;It would certainly add greatly, perhaps even dangerously,to my unpopularity if I did, but you three are leaving Comporellon soonand I take it you will never quote me as a source.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have our word of honor,&quot; said Pelorat quickly.<br />
  &quot;Then here is a summary of what is supposed to have happened,shorn of any supernaturalism or moralizing. Earth existed as thesole world of human beings for an immeasurable period and then, abouttwenty to twenty-five thousand years ago, the human species developedinterstellar travel by way of the hyperspatial Jump and colonized agroup of planets.<br />
  The Settlers on these planets made use of robots, which had firstbeen devised on Earth before the days of hyperspatial travel and doyou know what robots are, by the way?&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot;<br />
&quot; said Trevize. &quot;<br />
&quot;We have been asked that more than once. We knowwhat robots are.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;The Settlers, with a thoroughly roboticized society, developeda high technology and unusual longevity and despised their ancestralworld. According to more dramatic versions of their story, they dominatedand oppressed the ancestral world.&quot;<br />
  Eventually, then, Earth sent out a new group of Settlers, amongwhom robots were forbidden. Of the new worlds, Comporellon was amongthe first. Our own patriots insist it was the first, butthere is no evidence of that that a Skeptic can accept. The first groupof Settlers died out, and Trevize said, &quot;Why did the first set die out, Dr. Deniador?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why? Usually they are imagined by our romantics as having beenpunished for their crimes by He Who Punishes, though no one bothersto say why He waited so long. But one doesn't have to resort to fairytales. It is easy to argue that a society that depends totally on robotsbecomes soft and decadent, dwindling and dying out of sheer boredom or,more subtly, by losing the will to live.<br />
  The second wave of Settlers, without robots, lived on and took overthe entire Galaxy, but Earth grew radioactive and slowly dropped out ofsight. The reason usually given for this is that there were robots onEarth, too, since the first wave had encouraged that.Bliss, who had listened to the account with some visible impatience,said, &quot;Well, Dr. Deniador, radioactivity or not, and however many wavesof settlers there might have been, the crucial question is a simpleone. Exactly where is Earth? What are its co-ordinates?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;The answer to that question is: I don't know. Butcome, it is time for lunch. I can have one brought in, and we can discussEarth over it for as long as you want.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don't know ?&quot; said Trevize, the sound of his voicerising in pitch and intensity.<br />
  Actually, as far as I know, no one knows.&quot;But that is impossible.&quot;Councilman, said Deniador, with a soft sigh, &quot;if you wish tocall the truth impossible, that is your privilege, but it will get younowhere.&quot;<br />
  Chapter 7: Leaving Comporellon<br />
  26Luncheon consisted of a heap of soft, crusty balls thatcame in different shades and that contained a variety of fillings.<br />
  Deniador picked up a small object which unfolded into a pair of thin,transparent gloves, and put them on. His guests followed suit.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;What is inside these objects, please?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;The pink ones are filled with spicy chopped fish, agreat Comporellian delicacy. These yellow ones contain a cheese fillingthat is very mild. The green ones contain a vegetable mixture. Do eatthem while they are a quite warm. Later we will have hot almond pie andthe usual beverages. I might recommend the hot cider. In a cold climate,we have a tendency to heat our foods, even desserts.&quot;<br />
&quot;You do yourself well,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  Not really, said Deniador. &quot;I'm being hospitable to guests. Formyself, I get along on very little. I don't have much body mass tosupport, as you have probably noticed.&quot;Trevize bit into one of the pink ones and found it very fishy indeed,with all overlay of spices that was pleasant to the taste but which,he thought, along with the fish itself, would remain with him for therest of the day and, perhaps, into the night.<br />
  When he withdrew the object with the bite taken out of it, he foundthat the crust had closed in over the contents. There was no squirt,no leakage, and, for a moment, he wondered at the purpose of thegloves. These seemed no chance of getting his hands moist and stickyif he didn't use them, so he decided it was a matter of hygiene. Thegloves substituted for a washing of the hands if that were inconvenientand custom, probably, now dictated their use even if the hands werewashed. (Lizalor hadn't used gloves when he had eaten with her the daybefore. Perhaps that was because she was a mountain woman.)He said, &quot;Would it be unmannerly to talk business over lunch?&quot;<br />
&quot;By Comporellian standards, Councilman, it would be, but you are myguests, and we will go by your standards. If you wish to speak seriously,and do not think or care that that might diminish yourpleasure in the food, please do so, and I will join you.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Thank you. Minister Lizalor implied no, shestated quite bluntly that Skeptics were unpopular on this world. Isthat so?&quot;Deniador's good humor seemed to intensify. &quot;Certainly. How hurt we'd beif we weren't. Comporellon, you see, is a frustrated world. Without anyknowledge of the details, there is the general mythic belief, that once,many millennia ago, when the inhabited Galaxy was small, Comporellonwas the leading world. We never forget that, and the fact that in knownhistory we have not been leaders irks us, fills us thepopulation in general, that is with a feeling of injustice.<br />
  &quot;Yet what can we do? The government was forced to be a loyal vassalof the Emperor once, and is a loyal Associate of the Foundation now. Andthe more we are made aware of our subordinate position, the strongerthe belief in the great, mysterious days of the past become.<br />
  What, then, can Comporellon do? They could never defy the Empire inolder times and they can't openly defy the Foundation now. They takerefuge, therefore, in attacking and hating us, since we don't believethe legends and laugh at the superstitions.&quot;<br />
  Nevertheless, we are safe from the grosser effects ofpersecution. We control the technology, and we fill the faculties of theUniversities. Some of us, who are particularly outspoken, have difficultyin teaching classes openly. I have that difficulty, for instance, thoughI have my students and hold meetings quietly off-campus. Nevertheless,if we were really driven out of public life, the technology wouldfail and the Universities would lose accreditation with the Galaxygenerally. Presumably, such is the folly of human beings, the prospectsof intellectual suicide might not stop them from indulging their hatred,but the Foundation supports us. Therefore, we are constantly scoldedand sneered at and denounced and never touched.Trevize said, &quot;Is it popular opposition that keeps you from tellingus where Earth is? Do you fear that, despite everything, the anti-Skepticfeeling might turn ugly if you go too far?&quot;Deniador shook his head. &quot;No. Earth's location is unknown. I am nothiding anything from you out of fear or for any other reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;But look,&quot; said Trevize urgently. &quot;There are a limited numberof planets in this sector of the Galaxy that possess the physicalcharacteristics associated with habitability, and almost all ofthem must be not only inhabitable, but inhabited, and therefore wellknown to you. How difficult would it be to explore the sector for aplanet that would be habitable were it not for the fact that it wasradioactive? Besides that, you would look for such a planet with a large,satellite in attendance. Between radioactivity and a large satellite,Earth would be absolutely unmistakable and could not be missed evenwith only a casual search. It might take some time but that would bethe only difficulty.&quot;Deniador said, &quot;The Skeptic's view is, of course, that Earth'sradioactivity and its large satellite are both simply legends. If welook for them, we look for sparrow-milk and rabbit-feathers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but that shouldn't stop Comporellon from at least takingon the search. If they find a radioactive world of the proper size forhabitability, with a large satellite, what an appearance of credibilityit would lend to Comporellian legendry in general.&quot;Deniador laughed. &quot;It may be that Comporellon doesn't search for thatvery reason. If we fail, or if we find an Earth obviously differentfrom the legends, the reverse would take place. Comporellian legendryin general would be blasted and made into a laughingstock. Comporellonwouldn't risk that.&quot;Trevize paused, then went on, very earnestly, &quot;Besides, even ifwe discount those two uniquities if there is such a word inGalactic of radioactivity and a large satellite, there is a thirdthat, by definition, must exist, without any reference to legends. Earthmust have upon it either a flourishing life of incredible diversity,or the remnants of one, or, at the very least, the fossil record of sucha one.&quot;Deniador said, &quot;Councilman, while Comporellon has sent out noorganized search party for Earth, we do have occasion totravel through space, and we occasionally have reports from ships thathave strayed from their intended routes for one reason or another. Jumpsare not always perfect, as perhaps you know. Nevertheless, there havebeen no reports of any planets with properties resembling those of thelegendary Earth, or any planet that is bursting with life. Nor is any shiplikely to land on what seems an uninhabited planet in order that the crewmight go fossil-hunting. If, then, in thousands of years nothing of thesort has been reported, I am perfectly willing to believe that locatingEarth is impossible, because Earth is not there to be located.&quot;Trevize said, in frustration, &quot;But Earth must besomewhere . Somewhere there is a planet on which humanityand all the familiar forms of life associated with humanity evolved. IfEarth is not in this section of the Galaxy, it must be elsewhere.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Deniador cold-bloodedly, &quot;but in all this time,it hasn't turned up anywhere.&quot;<br />
&quot;People haven't really looked for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, apparently you are. I wish you luck, but I would never bet onyour success.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Have there been attempts to determine the possibleposition of Earth by indirect means, by some means other than a directsearch?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said two voices at once. Deniador, who was the owner of one ofthe voices, said to Pelorat, &quot;Are you thinking of Yariff's project?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  Then would you explain it to the Councilman? I think he would morereadily believe you than me.Pelorat said, &quot;You see, Golan, in the last days of the Empire, therewas a time when the Search for Origins, as they called it, was a popularpastime, perhaps to get away from the unpleasantness of the surroundingreality. The Empire was in a process of disintegration at that time,you know.<br />
  &quot;It occurred to a Livian historian, Humbal Yariff, that whatever theplanet of origin, it would have settled worlds near itself sooner thanit would settle planets farther away. In general, the farther a worldfrom the point of origin the later it would have been settled.<br />
  Suppose, then, one recorded the date of settlement of all habitableplanets in the Galaxy, and made networks of all that were a given numberof millennia old. There could be a network drawn through all planets tenthousand years old; another through those twelve thousand years old, stillanother through those fifteen thousand years old. Each network would, intheory, be roughly spherical and they should be roughly concentric. Theolder networks would form spheres smaller in radius than the youngerones, and if one worked out all the centers they should fall within acomparatively small volume of space that would include the planet oforigin Earth.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pelorat's face was very earnest as he kept drawing spherical surfaceswith his cupped hands. &quot;<br />
&quot;Do you see my point, Golan?&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. But I take it that it didn't work.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Theoretically, it should have, old fellow. One trouble was that timesof origin were totally inaccurate. Every world exaggerated its own ageto one degree or another and there was no easy way of determining ageindependently of legend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss said, &quot;<br />
&quot;Carbon-14 decay in ancient timber.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly, dear,&quot;<br />
&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;<br />
&quot;but you would have had to getco-operation from the worlds in question, and that was never given. Noworld wanted its own exaggerated claim of age to be destroyed and theEmpire was then in no position to override local objections in a matterso unimportant. It had other things on its mind.&quot;<br />
  &quot;All that Yariff could do was to make use of worlds that were onlytwo thousand years old at most, and whose founding had been meticulouslyrecorded under reliable circumstances. There were few of those, andwhile they were distributed in roughly spherical symmetry, the centerwas relatively close to Trantor, the Imperial capital, because that waswhere the colonizing expeditions had originated for those relativelyfew worlds.<br />
  That, of course, was another problem. Earth was not the only point oforigin of settlement for other worlds. As time went on, the older worldssent out settlement expeditions of their own, and at the time of theheight of Empire, Trantor was a rather copious source of those. Yariffwas, rather unfairly, laughed at and ridiculed and his professionalreputation was destroyed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize said, &quot;<br />
&quot;I get the story, Janov. Dr. Deniador, is therethen nothing at all you could give me that represents the faintestpossibility of hope? Is there any other world where it is conceivablethere may be some information concerning Earth?&quot;<br />
&quot;Deniador sank into doubtful thought for a while. &quot;<br />
&quot;We-eeell,&quot;<br />
&quot; he saidat last, drawing out the word hesitantly, &quot;<br />
&quot;as a Skeptic I must tell youthat I'm not sure that Earth exists, or has ever existed. However &quot;<br />
&quot;He fell silent again.&quot;<br />
  Finally, Bliss said, &quot;I think you've thought of something that mightbe important, Doctor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Important? I doubt it,&quot; said Deniador faintly. &quot;Perhaps amusing,however. Earth is not the only planet whose position is a mystery. Thereare the worlds of the first group of Settlers; the Spacers, as theyare called in our legends. Some call the planets they inhabited the`Spacer worlds'; others call them the `Forbidden Worlds.' The lattername is now the usual one.<br />
  In their pride and prime, the legend goes, the Spacers had lifetimesstretching out for centuries, and refused to allow our own short-livedancestors to land on their worlds. After we had defeated them, thesituation was reversed. We scorned to deal with them and left them tothemselves, forbidding our own ships and Traders to deal with them. Hencethose planets became the Forbidden Worlds. We were certain, so the legendstates, that He Who Punishes would destroy them without our intervention,and, apparently, He did. At least, no Spacer has appeared in the Galaxyto our knowledge, in many millennia.&quot;Do you think that the Spacers would know about Earth? saidTrevize.<br />
  Conceivably, since their worlds were older than any of ours. That is,if any Spacers exist, which is extremely unlikely.&quot;Even if they don't exist, their worlds do and may containrecords.&quot;If you can find the worlds.Trevize looked exasperated. &quot;Do you mean to say that the key to Earth,the location of which is unknown, may be found on Spacer worlds, thelocation of which is also unknown?&quot;Deniador shrugged. &quot;We have had no dealings with them for twentythousand years. No thought of them. They, too, like Earth, have recededinto the mists.&quot;<br />
&quot;How many worlds did the Spacers live on?&quot;<br />
&quot;The legends speak of fifty such worlds a suspiciously roundnumber. There were probably far fewer.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you don't know the location of a single one of the fifty?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, now, I wonder &quot;<br />
&quot;What do you wonder?&quot;Deniador said, &quot;Since primeval history is my hobby, as it isDr. Pelorat's, I have occasionally explored old documents in search ofanything that might refer to early time; something more than legends. Lastyear, I came upon the records of an old ship, records that were almostindecipherable. It dated back to the very old days when our world wasnot yet known as Comporellon. The name `Baleyworld' was used, which,it seems to me, may be an even earlier form of the `Benbally world'<br />
  of our legends.&quot;Pelorat said, excitedly, &quot;Have you published?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;I do not wish to dive until I am sure thereis water in the swimming pool, as the old saying has it. You see, therecord says that the captain of the ship had visited a Spacer world andtaken off with him a Spacer woman.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;But you said that the Spacers did not allow visitors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly, and that is the reason I don't publish the material. Itsounds incredible. There are vague tales that could be interpreted asreferring to the Spacers and to their conflict with the Settlers ourown ancestors. Such tales exist not only on Comporellon but onmany worlds in many variations, but all are in absolute accord in onerespect. The two groups, Spacers and Settlers, did not mingle. Therewas no social contact, let alone sexual contact, and yet apparentlythe Settler captain and the Spacer woman were held together by bondsof love. This is so incredible that I see no chance of the story beingaccepted as anything but, at best, a piece of romantic historicalfiction.&quot;Trevize looked disappointed. &quot;Is that all?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Councilman, there is one more matter. I came across somefigures in what was left of the log of the ship that might or mightnot represent spatial co-ordinates. If they were and I repeat,since my Skeptic's honor compels me to, that they might not be theninternal evidence made me conclude they were the spatial co-ordinatesof three of the Spacer worlds. One of them might be the Spacer worldwhere the captain landed and from which he withdrew his Spacer love.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Might it not be that even if the tale is fiction,the coordinates are real?&quot;<br />
&quot;It might be,&quot; said Deniador. &quot;I will give you the figures, and youare free to use them, but you might get nowhere. And yet I havean amusing notion.&quot; His quick smile made its appearance.<br />
  What is that? said Trevize.<br />
  What if one of those sets of co-ordinates represented Earth?27Comporellon's sun, distinctly orange, was larger inappearance than the sun of Terminus, but it was low in the sky and gaveout little heat. The wind, fortunately light, touched Trevize's cheekwith icy fingers.<br />
  He shivered inside the electrified coat he had been given by MitzaLizalor, who now stood next to him. He said, &quot;It must warm up sometime,Mitza.&quot;She glanced up at the sun briefly, and stood there in the emptiness ofthe spaceport, showing no signs of discomfort tall, large, wearinga lighter coat than Trevize had on, and if not impervious to the cold,at least scornful of it.<br />
  She said, &quot;We have a beautiful summer. It is not a long one but ourfood crops are adapted to it. The strains are carefully chosen so thatthey grow quickly in the sun and do not frostbite easily. Our domesticanimals are well furred, and Comporellian wool is the best in the Galaxyby general admission. Then, too, we have farm settlements in orbitabout Comporellon that grow tropical fruit. We actually export cannedpineapples of superior flavor. Most people who know us as a cold worlddon't know that.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I thank you for coming to see us off, Mitza, and forbeing willing to co-operate with us on this mission of ours. For my ownpeace of mind, however, I must ask whether you will find yourself inserious trouble over this.&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot; She shook her head proudly. &quot;No trouble. In the first place, Iwill not be questioned. I am in control of transportation, which meansI alone set the rules for this spaceport and others, for the entrystations, for the ships that come and go. The Prime Minister dependson me for all that and is only too delighted to remain ignorant of itsdetails. And even if I were questioned, I have but to tell thetruth. The government would applaud me for not turning the ship over tothe Foundation. So would the people if it were safe to let them know. Andthe Foundation itself would not know of it.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;The government might be willing to keep the ship fromthe Foundation, but would they be willing to approve your letting ustake it away?&quot;Lizalor smiled. &quot;You are a decent human being, Trevize. You havefought tenaciously to keep your ship and now that you have it you takethe trouble to concern yourself with my welfare.&quot; She reached toward himtentatively as though tempted to give some sign of affection and then,with obvious difficulty, controlled the impulse.<br />
  She said, with a renewed brusqueness, &quot;Even if they question mydecision, I have but to tell them that you have been, and still are,searching for the Oldest, and they will say I did well to get rid ofyou as quickly as I did, ship and all, And they will perform the ritesof atonement that you were ever allowed to land in the first place,though there was no way we might have guessed what you were doing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you truly fear misfortune to yourself and the world because ofmy presence?&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Lizalor stolidly. Then she said, more softly, &quot;Youhave brought misfortune to me, already, for now that I have known you,Comporellian men will seem more sapless still. I will be left with anunappeasable longing. He Who Punishes has already seen to that.&quot;Trevize hesitated, then said, &quot;I do not wish you to change your mindon this matter, but I do not wish you to suffer needless apprehension,either. You must know that this matter of my bringing misfortune on youis simply superstition.&quot;<br />
&quot;The Skeptic told you that, I presume.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know it without his telling me.&quot;Lizalor brushed her face, for a thin rime was gathering on herprominent eyebrows and said, &quot;I know there are some who think itsuperstition. That the Oldest brings misfortune is, however, a fact. Ithas been demonstrated many times and all the clever Skeptical argumentscan't legislate the truth out of existence.&quot;She thrust out her hand suddenly. &quot;Good-bye, Golan. Get on the shipand join your companions before your soft Terminian body freezes in ourcold, but kindly wind.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good-bye, Mitza, and I hope to see you when I return.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, you have promised to return and I have tried to believe thatyou would. I have even told myself that I would come out and meet youat your ship in space so that misfortune would fall only on me and notupon my world but you will not return.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not so! I will! I would not give you up that easily, having hadpleasure of you.&quot; And at that moment, Trevize was firmly convinced thathe meant it.<br />
  I do not doubt your romantic impulses, my sweet Foundationer, butthose who venture outward on a search for the Oldest will never comeback anywhere. I know that in my heart.Trevize tried to keep his teeth from chattering. It was from coldand he didn't want her to think it was from fear. He said, &quot;That, too,is superstition.&quot;<br />
&quot;And yet,&quot; she said, &quot;that, too, is true.&quot;28It was good to be back in the pilot-room of theFar Star . It might be cramped for room. It might be a bubble ofimprisonment in infinite space. Nevertheless, it was familiar, friendly,and warm.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;I'm glad you finally came aboard. I was wondering howlong you would remain with the Minister.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not long,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It was cold.&quot;<br />
&quot;It seemed to me,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;that you were considering remainingwith her and postponing the search for Earth. I do not like to probeyour mind even lightly, but I was concerned for you and that temptationunder which you labored seemed to leap out at me.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;You're quite right. Momentarily at least, I felt thetemptation. The Minister is a remarkable woman and I've never met anyonequite like her. Did you strengthen my resistance, Bliss?&quot;She said, &quot;I've told you many times I must not and will not tamper withyour mind in any way, Trevize. You beat down the temptation, I imagine,through your strong sense of duty.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I rather think not.&quot; He smiled wryly. &quot;Nothing so dramatic andnoble. My resistance was strengthened, for one thing, by the fact thatis was cold, and for another, by the sad thought that it wouldn't takemany sessions with her to kill me. I could never keep up the pace.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Well, anyway, you are safely aboard. What are we goingto do next?&quot;<br />
&quot;In the immediate future, we are going to move outward throughthe planetary system at a brisk pace until we are far enough fromComporellon's sun to make a Jump.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you think we will be stopped or followed?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I really think that the Minister is anxious only that we go awayas rapidly as possible and stay away, in order that the vengeance of HeWho Punishes not fall upon the planet. In fact &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;She believes the vengeance will surely fall on us. She is underthe firm conviction that we will never return. This, I hasten to add,is not an estimate of my probable level of infidelity, which she has hadno occasion to measure. She meant that Earth is so terrible a bearer ofmisfortune that anyone who seeks it must die in the process.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;How many have left Comporellon in search of Earth thatshe can make such a statement?&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt that any Comporellian has ever left on such a search. I toldher that her fears were mere superstition.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you believe that, or have you let hershake you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I know her fears are the purest superstition in the form she expressesthem, but they may be well founded just the same.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean, radioactivity will kill us if we try to land on it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't believe that Earth is radioactive. What I do believe is thatEarth protects itself. Remember that all reference to Earth in the Libraryon Trantor has been removed. Remember that Gaia's marvelous memory, inwhich all the planet takes part down to the rock strata of the surfaceand the molten metal at the core, stops short of penetrating far enoughback to tell us anything of Earth.<br />
  Clearly, if Earth is powerful enough to do that, it might also becapable of adjusting minds in order to force belief in its radioactivity,and thus preventing any search for it. Perhaps because Comporellon isso close that it represents a particular danger to Earth, there is thefurther reinforcement of a curious blankness. Deniador, who is a Skepticand a scientist, is utterly convinced that there is no use searching forEarth. He says it cannot be found. And that is why the Minister'ssuperstition may be well founded. If Earth is so intent on concealingitself, might it not kill us, or distort us, rather than allow us tofind it?Bliss frowned and said, &quot;Gaia &quot;Trevize said quickly, &quot;Don't say Gaia will protect us. Since Earthwas able to remove Gaia's earliest memories, it is clear that in anyconflict between the two Earth will win.&quot;Bliss said coldly, &quot;How do you know that the memories were removed? Itmight be that it simply took time for Gaia to develop a planetary memoryand that we can now probe backward only to the time of the completionof that development. And if the memory was removed, howcan you be sure that it was Earth that did it?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I don't know. I merely advance my speculations.&quot;Pelorat put in, rather timidly, &quot;If Earth is so powerful, and so intenton preserving its privacy, so to speak, of what use is our search? Youseem to think Earth won't allow us to succeed and will kill us if thatwill be what it takes to keep us from succeeding. In that case, is thereany sense in not abandoning this whole thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;It might seem we ought to give up, I admit, but I have this powerfulconviction that Earth exists, and I must and will find it. And Gaiatells me that when I have powerful convictions of this sort, I am alwaysright.&quot;<br />
&quot;But how can we survive the discovery, old chap?&quot;<br />
&quot;It may be,&quot; said Trevize, with an effort at lightness, &quot;that Earth,too, will recognize the value of my extraordinary rightness and will leaveme to myself. But  and this is what I am finally gettingat I cannot be certain that you two will survive and that is ofconcern to me. It always has been, but it is increasing now and it seemsto me that I ought to take you two back to Gaia and then proceed on myown. It is I, not you, who first decided I must search for Earth; it is I,not you, who see value in it; it is I, not you, who am driven. Let it beI, then, not you, who take the risk. Let me go on alone. Janov?&quot;Pelorat's long face seemed to grow longer as he buried his chin inhis neck. &quot;I won't deny I feel nervous, Golan, but I'd be ashamed toabandon you. I would disown myself if I did so.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;Gaia will not abandon you, Trevize, whatever you do. If Earth shouldprove dangerous, Gaia will protect you as far as it can. And in any case,in my role as Bliss, I will not abandon Pel, and if he clings to you,then I certainly cling to him.&quot;Trevize said grimly, &quot;Very well, then. I've given you your chance. Wego on together.&quot;<br />
&quot;Together,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  Pelorat smiled slightly, and gripped Trevize'sshoulder. &quot;Together. Always.&quot;29Bliss said, &quot;Look at that, Pel.&quot;She had been making use of the ship's telescope by hand, almostaimlessly, as a change from Pelorat's library of Earth-legendry.<br />
  Pelorat approached, placed an arm about her shoulders and looked atthe viewscreen. One of the gas giants of the Comporellian planetary systemwas in sight, magnified till it seemed the large body it really was.<br />
  In color it was a soft orange streaked with paler stripes. Viewedfrom the planetary plane, and more distant from the sun than the shipitself was, it was almost a complete circle of light.<br />
  Beautiful, said Pelorat.<br />
  The central streak extends beyond the planet, Pel.Pelorat furrowed his brow and said, &quot;You know, Bliss, I believeit does.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you suppose it's an optical illusion?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I'm not sure, Bliss. I'm as much a space-novice asyou are Golan!&quot;Trevize answered the call with a rather feeble &quot;What is it?&quot; andentered the pilot-room, looking a bit rumpled, as though he had just beennapping on his bed with his clothes on which was exactly what hehad been doing.<br />
  He said, in a rather peevish way, &quot;Please! Don't be handling theinstruments.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's just the telescope,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Look at that.&quot;Trevize did. &quot;It's a gas giant, the one they call Gallia, accordingto the information I was given.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can you tell it's that one, just looking?&quot;<br />
&quot;For one thing,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;at our distance from the sun, andbecause of the planetary sizes and orbital positions, which I've beenstudying in plotting our course, that's the only one you could magnifyto that extent at this time. For another thing, there's the ring.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ring?&quot; said Bliss, mystified.<br />
  All you can see is a thin, pale marking, because we're viewing italmost edge-on. We can zoom up out of the planetary plane and give youa better view. Would you like that?Pelorat said, &quot;I don't want to make you have to recalculate positionsand courses, Golan. &quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well, the computer will do it for me with little trouble.&quot; He satdown at the computer as he spoke and placed his hands on the markings thatreceived them. The computer, finely attuned to his mind, did the rest.<br />
  The Far Star , free of fuel problems or of inertial sensations,accelerated rapidly, and once again, Trevize felt a surge of love for acomputer-and-ship that responded in such a way to him as thoughit was his thought that powered and directed it, as though it were apowerful and obedient extension of his will.<br />
  It was no wonder the Foundation wanted it back; no wonder Comporellonhad wanted it for itself. The only surprise was that the force ofsuperstition had been strong enough to cause Comporellon to be willingto give it up.<br />
  Properly armed, it could outrun or outfight any ship in the Galaxy,or any combination of ships provided only that it did not encounteranother ship like itself.<br />
  Of course, it was not properly armed. Mayor Branno, in assigning himthe ship, had at least been cautious enough to leave it unarmed.<br />
  Pelorat and Bliss watched intently as the planet, Gallia, slowly,slowly, tipped toward them. The upper pole (whichever it was) becamevisible, with turbulence in a large circular region around it, whilethe lower pole retired behind the bulge of the sphere.<br />
  At the upper end, the dark side of the planet invaded the sphere oforange light, and the beautiful circle became increasingly lopsided.<br />
  What seemed more exciting was that the central pale streak was nolonger straight but had come to be curved, as were the other streaks tothe north and south, but more noticeably so.<br />
  Now the central streak extended beyond the edges of the planet verydistinctly and did so in a narrow loop on either side. There was noquestion of illusion; its nature was apparent. It was a ring of matter,looping about the planet, and hidden on the far side.<br />
  That's enough to give you the idea, I think, said Trevize. &quot;If wewere to move over the planet, you would see the ring in its circularform, concentric about the planet, touching it nowhere. You'll probablysee that it's not one ring either but several concentric rings.&quot;<br />
&quot;I wouldn't have thought it possible,&quot; said Pelorat blankly. &quot;Whatkeeps it in space?&quot;<br />
&quot;The same thing that keeps a satellite in space,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Therings consist of tiny particles, every one of which is orbiting theplanet. The rings are so close to the planet that tidal effects preventit from coalescing into a single body.&quot;Pelorat shook his head. &quot;It's horrifying when I think of it, oldman. How is it possible that I can have spent my whole life as a scholarand yet know so little about astronomy?&quot;<br />
&quot;And I know nothing at all about the myths of humanity. No one canencompass all of knowledge. The point is that these planetaryrings aren't unusual. Almost every single gas giant has them, even ifit's only a thin curve of dust. As it happens, the sun of Terminus has notrue gas giant in its planetary family, so unless a Terminian is a spacetraveler, or has taken University instruction in astronomy, he's likelyto know nothing about planetary rings. What is unusual is a ring thatis sufficiently broad to be bright and noticeable, like that one. It'sbeautiful. It must be a couple of hundred kilometers wide, at least.&quot;At this point, Pelorat snapped his fingers. &quot; That's what it meant.&quot;Bliss looked startled. &quot;What is it, Pel?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;I came across a scrap of poetry once, very ancient,and in an archaic version of Galactic that was hard to make out but thatwas good evidence of great age. Though I shouldn't complain of thearchaism, old chap. My work has made me an expert on various varietiesof Old Galactic, which is quite gratifying even if it is of no use tome whatever outside my work. What was I talking about?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;An old scrap of poetry, Pel dear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, Bliss,&quot; he said. And to Trevize, &quot;She keeps close trackof what I say in order to pull me back whenever I get off-course, whichis most of the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's part of your charm, Pel,&quot; said Bliss, smiling.<br />
  Anyway, this scrap of poetry purported to describe the planetarysystem of which Earth was part. Why it should do so, I don't know,for the poem as a whole does not survive; at least, I was never ableto locate it. Only this one portion survived, perhaps because of itsastronomical content. In any case, it spoke of the brilliant triplering of the sixth planet `both brade and large, sae the woruld shronk incomparisoun.' I can still quote it, you see. I didn't understand what aplanet's ring could be. I remember thinking of three circles on one sideof the planet, all in a row. It seemed so nonsensical, I didn't botherto include it in my library. I'm sorry now I didn't inquire. He shookhis head. &quot;Being a mythologist in today's Galaxy is so solitary a job,one forgets the good of inquiring.&quot;Trevize said consolingly, &quot;You were probably right to ignore it,Janov. It's a mistake to take poetic chatter literally.&quot;<br />
&quot;But that's what was meant,&quot; said Pelorat, pointing at thescreen. &quot;That's what the poem was speaking of. Three wide rings,concentric, wider than the planet itself.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I never heard of such a thing. I don't think ringscan be that wide. Compared to the planet they circle, they are alwaysvery narrow.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;We never heard of a habitable planet with a giantsatellite, either. Or one with a radioactive crust. This is uniquenessnumber three. If we find a radioactive planet that might be otherwisehabitable, with a giant satellite, and with another planet in thesystem that has a huge ring, there would be no doubt at all that we hadencountered Earth.&quot;Trevize smiled. &quot;I agree, Janov. If we find all three, we willcertainly have found Earth.&quot;<br />
&quot;If!&quot; said Bliss, with a sigh.<br />
  30They were beyond the main worlds of the planetarysystem, plunging outward between the positions of the two outermostplanets so that there was now no significant mass within 1.5 billionkilometers. Ahead lay only the vast cometary cloud which, gravitationally,was insignificant.<br />
  The Far Star had accelerated to a speed of 0.1 c , onetenth the speed of light. Trevize knew well that, in theory, the shipcould be accelerated to nearly the speed of light, but he also knew that,in practice, 0.1 c was the reasonable limit.<br />
  At that speed, any object with appreciable mass could be avoided,but there was no way of dodging the innumerable dust particles in space,and, to a far greater extent even, individual atoms and molecules. Atvery fast speeds, even such small objects could do damage, scouring andscraping the ship's hull. At speeds near the speed of light, each atomsmashing into the hull had the properties of a cosmic ray particle. Underthat penetrating cosmic radiation, anyone on board ship would not longsurvive.<br />
  The distant stars showed no perceptible motion in the viewscreen,and even though the ship was moving at thirty thousand kilometers persecond, there was every appearance of its standing still.<br />
  The computer scanned space to great distances for any oncoming objectof small but significant size that might be on a collision course, andthe ship veered gently to avoid it, in the extremely unlikely case thatthat would be necessary. Between the small size of any possible oncomingobject, the speed with which it was passed, and the lack of inertialeffect as the result of the course change, there was no way of tellingwhether anything ever took place in the nature of what might be termed a&quot;close call.&quot;Trevize, therefore, did not worry about such things, or even giveit the most casual thought. He kept his full attention on the threesets of co-ordinates he had been given by Deniador, and, particularly,on the set which indicated the object closest to themselves.<br />
  Is there something wrong with the figures? asked Peloratanxiously.<br />
  I can't tell yet, said Trevize. &quot;Co-ordinates in themselves aren'tuseful, unless you know the zero point and the conventions used insetting them up the direction in which to mark off the distance,so to speak, what the equivalent of a prime meridian is, and so on.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you find out such things?&quot; said Pelorat blankly.<br />
  I obtained the co-ordinates of Terminus and a few other knownpoints, relative to Comporellon. If I put them into the computer,it will calculate what the conventions must be for such co-ordinatesif Terminus and the other points are to be correctly located. I'm onlytrying to organize things in my mind so that I can properly program thecomputer for this. Once the conventions are determined, the figures wehave for the Forbidden Worlds might possibly have meaning.&quot;Only possibly? said Bliss.<br />
  Only possibly, I'm afraid, said Trevize. &quot;These are old figuresafter all presumably Comporellian, but not definitely. What ifthey are based on other conventions?&quot;<br />
&quot;In that case?&quot;<br />
&quot;In that case, we have only meaningless figures. But we justhave to find out.&quot;His hands flickered over the softly glowing keys of the computer,feeding it the necessary information. He then placed his hands onthe handmarks on the desk. He waited while the computer worked out theconventions of the known co-ordinates, paused a moment, then interpretedthe co-ordinates of the nearest Forbidden World by the same conventions,and finally located those co-ordinates on the Galactic map in itsmemory.<br />
  A starfield appeared on the screen and moved rapidly as it adjusteditself. When it reached stasis, it expanded with stars bleeding off theedges in all directions until they were almost all gone. At no pointcould the eye follow the rapid change; it was all a speckled blur. Untilfinally, a space one tenth of a parsec on each side (according to theindex figures below the screen) was all that remained. There was nofurther change, and only half a dozen dial sparks relieved the darknessof the screen.<br />
  Which one is the Forbidden World? asked Pelorat softly.<br />
  None of them, said Trevize. &quot;Four of them are red dwarfs, one anear-red dwarf, and the last a white dwarf. None of them can possiblyhave a habitable world in orbit about them.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know they're red dwarfs just by looking at them?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;We're not looking at real stars; we're looking at asection of the Galactic map stored in the computer's memory. Each oneis labeled. You can't see it and ordinarily I couldn't see it either,but as long as my hands are making contact, as they are, I am aware of aconsiderable amount of data on any star on which my eyes concentrate.&quot;Pelorat said in a woebegone tone, &quot;Then the co-ordinates areuseless.&quot;Trevize looked up at him, &quot;No, Janov. I'm not finished. There'sstill the matter of time. The co-ordinates for the Forbidden Worldare those of twenty thousand years ago. In that time, both it andComporellon have been revolving about the Galactic Center, and theymay well be revolving at different speeds and in orbits of differentinclinations and eccentricities. With time, therefore, the two worldsmay be drifting closer together or farther apart and, in twenty thousandyears, the Forbidden World may have drifted anywhere from one-half tofive parsecs off the mark. It certainly wouldn't be included in thattenth-parsec square.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do we do, then?&quot;<br />
&quot;We have the computer move the Galaxy twenty thousand years back intime relative to Comporellon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can it do that?&quot; asked Bliss, sounding rather awe-struck.<br />
  Well, it can't move the Galaxy itself back in time, but it can movethe map in its memory banks back in time.Bliss said, &quot;Will we see anything happen?&quot;<br />
&quot;Watch,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  Very slowly, the half-dozen stars crawled over the face of thescreen. A new star, not hitherto on the screen, drifted in from the lefthand edge, and Pelorat pointed in excitement. &quot;There! There!&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Sorry. Another red dwarf. They're very common. Atleast three fourths of all the stars in the Galaxy are red dwarfs.&quot;The screen settled down and stopped moving.<br />
  Well? said Bliss.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;That's it. That's the view of that portion of theGalaxy as it would have been twenty thousand years ago. At the verycenter of the screen is a point where the Forbidden World ought to beif it had been drifting at some average velocity.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ought to be, but isn't,&quot; said Bliss sharply.<br />
  It isn't, agreed Trevize, with remarkably little emotion.<br />
  Pelorat released his breath in a long sigh. &quot;Oh, too bad, Golan.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Wait, don't despair. I wasn't expecting to see thestar there.&quot;<br />
&quot;You weren't?&quot; said Pelorat, astonished.<br />
  No. I told you that this isn't the Galaxy itself, but the computer'smap of the Galaxy. If a real star is not included in the map, we don'tsee it. If the planet is called `Forbidden' and has been called so fortwenty thousand years, the chances are it wouldn't be included in themap. And it isn't, for we don't see it.Bliss said, &quot;We might not see it because it doesn't exist. TheComporellian legends may be false, or the co-ordinates may be wrong.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very true. The computer, however, can now make an estimate as towhat the co-ordinates ought to be at this time, now that it has locatedthe spot where it may have been twenty thousand years ago. Using theco-ordinates corrected for time, a correction I could only have madethrough use of the star map, we can now switch to the real starfield ofthe Galaxy itself.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;But you only assumed an average velocity for the ForbiddenWorld. What if its velocity was not average? You would not now have thecorrect co-ordinates.&quot;<br />
&quot;True enough, but a correction, assuming average velocity, is almostcertain to be closer to its real position, than if we had made no timecorrection at all.&quot;<br />
&quot;You hope!&quot; said Bliss doubtfully.<br />
  That's exactly what I do, said Trevize. &quot;I hope. And nowlet's look at the real Galaxy.&quot;The two onlookers watched tensely, while Trevize (perhaps to reducehis own tensions and delay the zero moment) spoke softly, almost asthough he were lecturing.<br />
  It's more difficult to observe the real Galaxy, he said. &quot;The map inthe computer is an artificial construction, with irrelevancies capable ofbeing eliminated. If there is a nebula obscuring the view, I can removeit. If the angle of view is inconvenient for what I have in mind, I canchange the angle, and so on. The real Galaxy, however, I must take asI find it, and if I want a change I must move physically through space,which will take far more time than it would take to adjust a map.&quot;And as he spoke, the screen showed a star cloud so rich in individualstars as to seem an irregular heap of powder.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;That's a large angle view of a section of the MilkyWay, and I want the foreground, of course. If I expand the foreground,the background will tend to fade in comparison. The co-ordinate spotis close enough to Comporellon so that I should be able to expand itto about the situation I had on the view of the map. Just let me putin the necessary instructions, if I can hold on to my sanity longenough. Now .&quot;The starfield expanded with a rush so that thousands of stars pushedoff every edge, giving the watchers so real a sensation of moving towardthe screen that all three automatically leaned backward as though inresponse to a forward rush.<br />
  The old view returned, not quite as dark as it had been on the map,but with the half-dozen stars shown as they had been in the originalview. And there, close to the center, was another star, shining far morebrightly than the others.<br />
  There it is, said Pelorat, in an awed whisper.<br />
  It may be. I'll have the computer take its spectrum and analyzeit. There was a moderately long pause, then Trevize said, &quot;Spectralclass, G-4, which makes it a trifle dimmer and smaller than Terminus'ssun, but rather brighter than Comporellon's sun. And no G-class starshould be omitted from the computer's Galactic map. Since this one is,that is a strong indication that it may be the sun about which theForbidden World revolves.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Is there any chance of its turning out that there is nohabitable planet revolving about this star after all?&quot;<br />
&quot;There's a chance, I suppose. In that case, we'll try to find theother two Forbidden Worlds.&quot;Bliss persevered. &quot;And if the other two are false alarms, too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Then we'll try something else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; said Trevize grimly.<br />
  Part Three - Aurora Chapter 8: Forbidden World<br />
  31&quot;Golan,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Does it bother you if I watch?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all, Janov,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  If I ask questions?&quot;Go ahead.Pelorat said, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;Trevize took his eyes off the viewscreen. &quot;I've got to measure thedistance of each star that seems to be near the Forbidden World onthe screen, so that I can determine how near they really are. Theirgravitational fields must be known and for that I need mass anddistance. Without that knowledge, one can't be sure of a clean Jump.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you do that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, each star I see has its co-ordinates in the computer's memorybanks and these can be converted into co-ordinates on the Comporelliansystem. That can, in turn, be slightly corrected for the actual positionof the For Star in space relative to Comporellon's sun, and that givesme the distance of each. Those red dwarfs all look quite near theForbidden World on the screen, but some might be much closer and somemuch farther. We need their three-dimensional position, you see.&quot;Pelorat nodded, and said, &quot;And you already have the co-ordinates ofthe Forbidden World &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but that's not enough. I need the distances of the otherstars to within a percent or so. Their gravitational intensity in theneighborhood of the Forbidden World is so small that a slight errormakes no perceptible difference. The sun about which the Forbidden Worldrevolves or might revolve possessss an enormously intensegravitational field in the neighborhood of the Forbidden World and Imust know its distance with perhaps a thousand times the accuracy ofthat of the other stars. The co-ordinatss alone won't do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then what do you do?&quot;<br />
&quot;I measure the apparent separation of the Forbidden World or,rather, its star from three nearby stars which are so dim it takesconsiderable magnification to make them out at all. Presumably, thosethree are very far away. We then keep one of those three stars centered onthe screen and Jump a tenth of a parsec in a direction at right angles tothe line of vision to the Forbidden World. We can do that safely enougheven without knowing distances to comparatively far-off stars.<br />
  The reference star which is centered would still be centered afterthe Jump. The two other dim stars, if all three are truly very distant,do not change their positions measurably. The Forbidden World, however,is close enough to change its apparent position in parallactic shift. Fromthe size of the shift, we can determine its distance. If I want to makedoubly certain, I choose three other stars and try again.Pelorat said, &quot;How long doss all that take?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not very long. The computer doss the heavy work. I just tell it whatto do. What really takes the time is that I have to study the resultsand make sure they look right and that my instructions aren't at faultsomehow. If I were one of those daredevils with utter faith in themselvesand the computer, it could all be done in a few minutes.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;It's really astonishing. Think how much the computerdoes for us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think of it all the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;What would you do without it?&quot;<br />
&quot;What would I do without a gravitic ship? What would I do withoutmy astronautic training? What would I do without twenty thousandyears of hyperspatial technology behind me? The fact is that I'mmyself here now. Suppose weeeere to imagine ourselves twentythousand additional years into the future. What technological marvelswould we have to be grateful for? Or might it be that twenty thousandyears hence humanity would not exist?&quot;<br />
&quot;Scarcely that,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Scarcely not exist. Even if wedon't become part of Galaxia, we would still have psychohistory toguide us.&quot;Trevize turned in his chair, releasing his handhold on thecomputer. &quot;Let it work out distances,&quot; he said, &quot;and let it check thematter a number of times. There's no hurry.&quot;He looked quizzically at Pelorat, and said, &quot;Psychohistory! You know,Janov, twice that subject came up on Comporellon, and twice it wasdescribed as a superstition. I said so once, and then Deniador said italso. After all, how can you define psychohistory but as a superstitionof the Foundation? Isn't it a belief without proof or evidence? What doyou think, Janov? It's more your field than mine.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Why do you say there's no evidence, Golan? Thesimulacrum of Hari Seldon has appeared in the Time Vault many times andhas discussed events as they happened. He could not have known whatthose events would be, in his time, had he not been able to predictthem psychohistorically.&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;That sounds impressive. He was wrong about theMule, but even allowing for that, it's impressive. Still, it has anuncomfortable magical feel to it. Any conjurer can do tricks.&quot;<br />
&quot;No conjurer could predict centuries into the future.&quot;<br />
&quot;No conjurer could really do what he makes you think he does.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come, Golan. I can't think of any trick that would allow me topredict what will happen five centuries from now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nor can you think of a trick that will allow a conjurer to readthe contents of a message hidden in a pseudo-tesseract on an unmannedorbiting satellite. Just the same, I've seen a conjurer do it. Has itever occurred to you that the Time Capsule, along with the Hari Seldonsimulacrum, may be rigged by the government?&quot;Pelorat looked as though he were revolted by the suggestion. &quot;Theywouldn't do that.&quot;Trevize made a scornful sound.<br />
  Pelorat said, &quot;And they'd be caught if they tried.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not at all sure of that. The point is, though, that we don'tknow how psychohistory works at all.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know how that computer works, but I know it works.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's because others know how it works. How would it be if noone knew how it worked? Then, if it stopped working for any reason, wewould be helpless to do anything about it. And if psychohistory suddenlystopped working &quot;<br />
&quot;The Second Foundationers know the workings of psychohistory.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know that, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;So it is said.&quot;<br />
&quot;Anything can be said. Ah, we have the distance of theForbidden World's star, and, I hope, very accurately. Let's considerthe figures.&quot;He stared at them for a long time, his lips moving occasionally,as though he were doing some rough calculations in his head. Finally,he said, without lifting his eyes, &quot;What's Bliss doing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sleeping, old chap,&quot; said Pelorat. Then, defensively, &quot;Sheneeds sleep, Golan. Maintaining herself as part of Gaiaacross hyperspace is energy-consuming.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose so,&quot; said Trevize, and turned back to the computer. Heplaced his hands on the desk and muttered, &quot;I'll let it go in severalJumps and have it recheck each time.&quot; Then he withdrew them againand said, &quot;I'm serious, Janov. What do you know aboutpsychohistory?&quot;Pelorat looked taken aback. &quot;Nothing. Being a historian,which I am, after a fashion, is worlds different from being apsychohistorian. Of course, I know the two fundamental basics ofpsychohistory, but everyone knows that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Even I do. The first requirement is that the number of human beingsinvolved must be large enough to make statistical treatment valid. Buthow large is `large enough'?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;The latest estimate of the Galactic populationis something like ten quadrillion, and that's probably anunderestimate. Surely, that's large enough.&quot;<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because psychohistory does work, Golan. No matter howyou chop logic, it does work.&quot;<br />
&quot;And the second requirement,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;is that human beingsnot be aware of psychohistory, so that the knowledge does not skew theirreactions. But they are aware of psychohistory.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only of its bare existence, old chap. That's not whatcounts. The second requirement is that human beings not be awareof the predictions of psychohistory and that they arenot except that the Second Foundationers are supposed to be awareof them, but they're a special case.&quot;<br />
&quot;And upon those two requirements alone , the science ofpsychohistory has been developed. That's hard to believe.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not out of those two requirements alone, &quot; said Pelorat. &quot;Thereare advanced mathematics and elaborate statistical methods. Thestory is if you want tradition that Hari Seldon devisedpsychohistory by modeling it upon the kinetic theory of gases. Each atomor molecule in a gas moves randomly so that we can't know the position orvelocity of any one of them. Nevertheless, using statistics, we can workout the rules governing their overall behavior with great precision. Inthe same way, Seldon intended to work out the overall behavior of humansocieties even though the solutions would not apply to the behavior ofindividual human beings.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but human beings aren't atoms.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;A human being has consciousness and his behavioris sufficiently complicated to make it appear to be free will. How Seldonhandled that I haven't any idea, and I'm sure I couldn't understandit even if someone who knew tried to explain it to me but hedid it.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;And the whole thing depends on dealing with people whoare both numerous and unaware. Doesn't that seem to you a quicksandishfoundation on which to build an enormous mathematical structure? Ifthose requirements are not truly met, then everything collapses.&quot;<br />
&quot;But since the Plan hasn't collapsed &quot;<br />
&quot;Or, if the requirements are not exactly false or inadequate butsimply weaker than they should be, psychohistory might work adequatelyfor centuries and then, upon reaching some particular crisis, wouldcollapse as it did temporarily in the time of the Mule. Orwhat if there is a third requirement?&quot;<br />
&quot;What third requirement?&quot; asked Pelorat, frowning slightly.<br />
  I don't know, said Trevize. &quot;An argument may seem thoroughlylogical and elegant and yet contain unexpressed assumptions. Maybe thethird requirement is an assumption so taken for granted that no one everthinks of mentioning it.&quot;<br />
&quot;An assumption that is so taken for granted is usually valid enough,or it wouldn't be so taken for granted.&quot;Trevize snorted. &quot;If you knew scientific history as well as you knowtraditional history, Janov, you would know how wrong that is. ButI see that we are now in the neighborhood of the sun of the ForbiddenWorld.&quot;And, indeed, centered on the screen, was a bright star one sobright that the screen automatically filtered its light to the pointwhere all other stars were washed out.<br />
  32Facilities for washing and for personal hygiene on boardthe Far Star were compact, and the use of water was always held to areasonable minimum to avoid overloading the recycling facilities. BothPelorat and Bliss had been sternly reminded of this by Trevize.<br />
  Even so, Bliss maintained an air of freshness at all times and herdark, long hair could be counted on to be glossy, her fingernails tosparkle.<br />
  She walked into the pilot-room and said, &quot;There you are!&quot;Trevize looked up and said, &quot;No need for surprise. We could scarcelyhave left the ship, and a thirty-second search would be bound touncover us inside the ship, even if you couldn't detect our presencementally.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;The expression was purely a form of greeting and notmeant to be taken literally, as you well know. Where are we? Anddon't say, `In the pilot-room.'&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss dear,&quot; said Pelorat, holding out one arm, &quot;we're at the outerregions of the planetary system of the nearest of the three ForbiddenWorlds.&quot;She walked to his side, placing her hand lightly on his shoulder,while his arm moved about her waist. She said, &quot;It can't be veryForbidden. Nothing has stopped us.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;It is only Forbidden because Comporellon and the otherworlds of the second wave of settlement have voluntarily placed the worldsof the first wave the Spacers out of bounds. If we ourselvesdon't feel bound by that voluntary agreement, what is to stop us?&quot;<br />
&quot;The Spacers, if any are left, might have voluntarily placed theworlds of the second wave out of bounds, too. Just because we don't mindintruding upon them doesn't mean that they don't mind it.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;If they exist. But so far we don't even knowif any planet exists for them to live on. So far, all we see are theusual gas giants. Two of them, and not particularly large ones.&quot;Pelorat said hastily, &quot;But that doesn't mean the Spacer worlddoesn't exist. Any habitable world would be much closer to the sunand much smaller and very hard to detect in the solar glare from thisdistance. We'll have to micro-Jump inward to detect such a planet.&quot; Heseemed rather proud to be speaking like a seasoned space traveler.<br />
  In that case, said Bliss, &quot;why aren't we moving inward?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not just yet,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I'm having the computer check as faras it can for any sign of an artificial structure. We'll move inwardby stages a dozen, if necessary checking at each stage. Idon't want to be trapped this time as we were when we first approachedGaia. Remember, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;Traps like that could catch us every day. The one at Gaia broughtme Bliss.&quot; Pelorat gazed at her fondly.<br />
  Trevize grinned. &quot;Are you hoping for a new Bliss every day?&quot;Pelorat looked hurt, and Bliss said, with a trace of annoyance,&quot;My good chap or whatever it is that Pel insists on callingyou you might as well move in more quickly. While I am with you,you will not be trapped.&quot;<br />
&quot;The power of Gaia?&quot;<br />
&quot;To detect the presence of other minds? Certainly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure you are strong enough, Bliss? I gather you must sleepquite a bit to regain strength expended at maintaining contact with themain body of Gaia. How far can I rely on the perhaps narrow limits ofyour abilities at this distance from the source?&quot;Bliss flushed. &quot;The strength of the connection is ample.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Don't be offended. I'm simply asking. Don't yousee this as a disadvantage of being Gaia? I am not Gaia. I am a completeand independent individual. That means I can travel as far as I wish frommy world and my people, and remain Golan Trevize. What powers I have,and such as they are, I continue to have, and they remain whereverI go. If I were alone in space, parsecs away from any human being,and unable, for some reason, to communicate with anyone in any way,or even to see the spark of a single star in the sky, I would be andremain Golan Trevize. I might not be able to survive, and I might die,but I would die Golan Trevize.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Alone in space and far from all others, you would beunable to call on the help of your fellows, on their different talentsand knowledge. Alone, as an isolated individual, you would be sadlydiminished as compared with youself as part of an integrated society. Youknow that.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;There would nevertheless not be the same diminution asin your case. There is a bond between you and Gaia that is far strongerthan the one between me and my society, and that bond stretches throughhyperspace and requires energy for maintenance, so that you must gasp,mentally, with the effort, and feel yourself to be a diminished entityfar more than I must.&quot;Bliss's young face set hard and, for a moment, she looked young nomore or, rather, she appeared ageless more Gaia than Bliss, asthough to refute Trevize's contention. She said, &quot;Even if everything yousay is so, Golan Trevize that is, was, and will be, that cannotperhaps be less, but certainly cannot be more even if everythingyou say is so, do you expect there is no price to be paid for a benefitgained? Is it not better to be a warm-blooded creature such as yourselfthan a cold-blooded creature such as a fish, or whatever?&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Tortoises are cold-blooded. Terminus doesn't have any,but some worlds do. They are shelled creatures, very slow-moving butlong-living.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, then, isn't it better to be a human being than a tortoise; tomove quickly whatever the temperature, rather than slowly? Isn't it betterto support high-energy activities, quickly contracting muscles, quicklyworking nerve fibers, intense and long-sustained thought than tocreep slowly, and sense gradually, and have only a blurred awareness ofthe immediate surroundings? Isn't it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Granted,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It is. What of it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, don't you know you must pay for warm-bloodedness? To maintainyour temperature above that of your surroundings, you must expend energyfar more wastefully than a tortoise must. You must be eating almostconstantly so that you can pour energy into your body as quickly as itleaks out. You would starve far more quickly than a tortoise would,and die more quickly, too. Would you rather be a tortoise, and livemore slowly and longer? Or would you rather pay the price and be aquick-moving, quick-sensing, thinking organism?&quot;<br />
&quot;Is this a true analogy, Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Trevize, for the situation with Gaia is more favorable. We don'texpend unusual quantities of energy when we are compactly together. It isonly when part of Gaia is at hyperspatial distances from the rest of Gaiathat energy expenditure rises. And remember that what you have votedfor is not merely a larger Gaia, not just a larger individual world. Youhave decided for Galaxia, for a vast complex of worlds. Anywhere in theGalaxy, you will be part of Galaxia and you will be closely surroundedby parts of something that extends from each interstellar atom to thecentral black hole. It would then require small amounts of energy toremain a whole. No part would be at any great distance from all otherparts. It is all this you have decided for, Trevize. How can you doubtthat you have chosen well?&quot;Trevize's head was bent in thought. Finally, he looked up and said,&quot;I may have chosen well, but I must be convinced of that. Thedecision I have made it the most important in the history of humanityand it is not enough that it be a good one. I must know it to be a good one.&quot;<br />
&quot;What more do you need than what I have told you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know, but I will find it on Earth.&quot; He spoke with absoluteconviction.<br />
  Pelorat said, &quot;Golan, the star shows a disc.&quot;It did. The computer, busy about its own affairs and not the leastconcerned with any discussion that might swirl about it, had beenapproaching the star in stages, and had reached the distance Trevizehad set for it.<br />
  They continued to be well outside the planetary plane and the computersplit the screen to show each of three small inner planets.<br />
  It was the innermost that had a surface temperature in the liquid-waterrange, and that had an oxygen atmosphere as well. Trevize waited for itsorbit to be computed and the first crude estimate seemed reasonable. Hekept that computation going, for the longer the planetary movement wasobserved, the more accurate the computation of its orbital elements.<br />
  Trevize said quite calmly, &quot;We have a habitable planet in view. Verylikely habitable.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; Pelorat looked as nearly delighted as his solemn expressionwould allow.<br />
  I'm afraid, though, said Trevize, &quot;that there's no giantsatellite. In fact, no satellite of any kind has been detected so far. Soit isn't Earth. At least, not if we go by tradition.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't worry about that, Golan.&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;I rather suspectedwe weren't going to encounter Earth here when I saw that neither of thegas giants had an unusual ring system.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very well, then,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;The next step is to find out thenature of the life inhabiting it. From the fact that it has an oxygenatmosphere, we can be absolutely certain that there is plant life uponit, but &quot;<br />
&quot;Animal life, too,&quot; said Bliss abruptly. &quot;And in quantity.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Trevize turned to her.<br />
  I can sense it. Only faintly at this distance, but the planet isunquestionably not only habitable, but inhabited.33The Far Star was in polar orbit about the Forbidden World,at a distance great enough to keep the orbital period at a little inexcess of six days. Trevize seemed in no hurry to come out of orbit.<br />
  Since the planet is inhabited, he explained, &quot;and since, according toDeniador, it was once inhabited by human beings who were technologicallyadvanced and who represent a first wave of Settlers the so-calledSpacers they may be technologically advanced still and may haveno great love for us of the second wave who have replaced them. I wouldlike them to show themselves, so that we can learn a little about thembefore risking a landing.&quot;<br />
&quot;They may not know we are here,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  We would, if the situation were reversed. I must assume, then, that,if they exist, they are likely to try to make contact withus. They might even want to come out and get us.&quot;But if they did come out after us and were technologically advanced,we might be helpless to &quot;I can't believe that, said Trevize. &quot;Technological advancement isnot necessarily all one piece. They might conceivably be far beyond us insome ways, but it's clear they don't indulge in interstellar travel. Itis we, not they, who have settled the Galaxy, and in all the history ofthe Empire, I know of nothing that would indicate that they left theirworlds and made themselves evident to us. If they haven't been spacetraveling, how could they be expected to have made serious advances inastronautics? And if they haven't, they can't possibly have anythinglike a gravitic ship. We may be essentially unarmed but even if theycome lumbering after us with a battleship, they couldn't possibly catchus. No, we wouldn't be helpless.&quot;<br />
&quot;Their advance may be in mentalics. It may be that the Mule was aSpacer &quot;Trevize shrugged in clear irritation. &quot;The Mule can't beeverything. The Gaians have described him as an aberrant Gaian. He'salso been considered a random mutant.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;To be sure, there have also been speculations nottaken very seriously, of course that he was a mechanical artifact. Arobot, in other words, though that word wasn't used.&quot;<br />
&quot;If there is something that seems mentally dangerous, we will haveto depend on Bliss to neutralize that. She can Is she asleep now,by the way?&quot;<br />
&quot;She has been,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;but she was stirring when I cameout here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Stirring, was she? Well, she'll have to be awake on short notice ifanything starts happening. You'll have to see to that, Janov.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, Golan,&quot; said Pelorat quietly.<br />
  Trevize shifted his attention to the computer. &quot;One thing that bothersme are the entry stations. Ordinarily, they are a sure sign of a planetinhabited by human beings with a high technology. But these &quot;<br />
&quot;Is there something wrong with them?&quot;<br />
&quot;Several things. In the first place, they're very archaic. Theymight be thousands of years old. In the second, there's no radiationbut thermals.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are thermals?&quot;<br />
&quot;Thermal radiation is given off by any object warmer than itssurroundings. It's a familiar signature that everything yields and itconsists of a broad band of radiation following a fixed pattern dependingon temperature. That is what the entry stations are radiating. If thereare working human devices aboard the stations, there is bound to bea leakage of nonthermal, nonrandom radiation. Since only thermals arepresent we can assume that either the stations are empty, and have been,perhaps, for thousands of years; or, if occupied, it is by people with atechnology so advanced in this direction that they leak no radiation.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;the planet has a high civilization,but the entry stations are empty because the planet has been left sostrictly alone for so long by our kind of Settlers that they are nolonger concerned about any approach.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps. Or perhaps it is a lure of some sort.&quot;Bliss entered, and Trevize, noting her out of the corner of his eyes,said grumpily, &quot;Yes, here we are.&quot;<br />
&quot;So I see,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;and still in an unchanged orbit. I can tellthat much.&quot;Pelorat explained hastily. &quot;Golan is being cautious, dear. Theentry stations seem unoccupied and we're not sure of the significanceof that.&quot;<br />
&quot;There's no need to worry about it,&quot; said Bliss indifferently. &quot;Thereare no detectable signs of intelligent life on the planet we'reorbiting.&quot;Trevize bent an astonished glare at her. &quot;What are you talkingabout? You said &quot;<br />
&quot;I said there was animal life on the planet, and so there is, butwhere in the Galaxy were you taught that animal life necessarily implieshuman life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why didn't you say this when you first detected animal life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because at that distance, I couldn't tell. I could barely detectthe unmistakable wash of animal neural activity, but there was no wayI could, at that intensity, tell butterflies from human beings.&quot;<br />
&quot;And now?&quot;<br />
&quot;We're much closer now, and you may have thought I was asleep, but Iwasn't or, at least, only briefly. I was, to use an inappropriateword, listening as hard as I could for any sign of mental activitycomplex enough to signify the presence of intelligence.&quot;<br />
&quot;And there isn't any?&quot;<br />
&quot;I would suppose,&quot; said Bliss, with sudden caution, &quot;that if Idetect nothing at this distance, there can't possibly be more than a fewthousand human beings on the planet. If we come closer, I can judge itstill more delicately.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, that changes things,&quot; said Trevize, with some confusion.<br />
  I suppose, said Bliss, who looked distinctly sleepy and, therefore,irritable. &quot;You can now discard all this business of analyzingradiation and inferring and deducing and who knows what else you mayhave been doing. My Gaian senses do the job much more efficiently andsurely. Perhaps you see what I mean when I say it is better to be aGaian than an Isolate.&quot;Trevize waited before answering, clearly laboring to hold histemper. When he spoke, it was with a polite, and almost formal tone, &quot;Iam grateful to you for the information. Nevertheless, you must understandthat, to use an analogy, the thought of the advantage of improving mysense of smell would be insufficient motive for me to decide to abandonmy humanity and become a bloodhound.&quot;34They could see the Forbidden World now, as they movedbelow the cloud layer and drifted through the atmosphere. It lookedcuriously moth-eaten.<br />
  The polar regions were icy, as might be expected, but they were notlarge in extent. The mountainous regions were barren, with occasionalglaciers, but they were not large in extent, either. There were smalldesert areas, well scattered.<br />
  Putting all that aside, the planet was, in potential, beautiful. Itscontinental areas were quite large, but sinuous, so that there werelong shorelines, and rich coastal plains of generous extent. Therewere lush tracts of both tropical and temperate forests, rimmed bygrasslands and yet the moth-eaten nature of it all was evident.<br />
  Scattered through the forests were semibarren areas, and parts ofthe grasslands were thin and sparse.<br />
  Some sort of plant disease? said Pelorat wonderingly.<br />
  No, said Bliss slowly. &quot;Something worse than that, and morepermanent.&quot;<br />
&quot;I've seen a number of worlds,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but nothing likethis.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have seen very few worlds,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;but I think the thoughtsof Gaia and this is what you might expect of a world from which humanityhas disappeared.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  Think about it, said Bliss tartly. &quot;No inhabited world has a trueecological balance. Earth must have had one originally, for if thatwas the world on which humanity evolved, there must have been longages when humanity did not exist, or any species capable of developingan advanced technology and the ability to modify the environment. Inthat case, a natural balance everchanging, of course musthave existed. On all other inhabited worlds, however, human beings havecarefully terraformed their new environments and established plant andanimal life, but the ecological system they introduce is bound to beunbalanced. It would possess only a limited number of species and onlythose that human beings wanted, or couldn't help introducing &quot;Pelorat said, &quot;You know what that reminds me of? Pardon me,Bliss, for interrupting, but it so fits that I can't resist tellingyou right now before I forget. There's an old creation myth I once cameacross; a myth in which life was formed on a planet and consisted of onlya limited assortment of species, just those useful to or pleasant forhumanity. The first human beings then did something silly nevermind what, old fellow, because those old myths are usually symbolic andonly confusing if they are taken literally and the planet's soilwas cursed. `Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee,'<br />
  is the way the curse was quoted though the passage sounds much betterin the archaic Galactic in which it was written. The point is, though,was it really a curse? Things human beings don't like and don't want,such as thorns and thistles, may be needed to balance the ecology.&quot;Bliss smiled. &quot;It's really amazing, Pel, how everything reminds youof a legend, and how illuminating they are sometimes. Human beings, interraforming a world, leave out the thorns and thistles, whatever theymay be, and human beings then have to labor to keep the world going. Itisn't a self-supporting organism as Gaia is. It is rather a miscellaneouscollection of Isolates and the collection isn't miscellaneous enoughto allow the ecological balance to persist indefinitely. If humanitydisappears, and if its guiding hands are removed, the world's pattern oflife inevitably begins to fall apart. The planet unterraforms itself.&quot;Trevize said skeptically, &quot;If that's what's happening, it doesn'thappen quickly. This world may have been free of human beings for twentythousand years and yet most of it still seems to be very much a goingconcern.&quot;<br />
&quot;Surely,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;that depends on how well the ecological balancewas set up in the first place. If it is a fairly good balance to beginwith, it might last for a long time without human beings. After all,twenty thousand years, though very long in terms of human affairs,is just overnight when compared to a planetary lifetime.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Pelorat, staring intently at the planetary vista,&quot;that if the planet is degenerating, we can be sure that the human beingsare gone.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I still detect no mental activity at the human level andI am willing to suppose that the planet is safely free of humanity. Thereis the steady hum and buzz of lower levels of consciousness, however,levels high enough to represent birds and mammals. Just the same, I'mnot sure that unterraforming is enough to show human beings are gone. Aplanet might deteriorate even if human beings existed upon it, if thesociety were itself abnormal and did not understand the importance ofpreserving the environment.&quot;<br />
&quot;Surely,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;such a society would quickly be destroyed. Idon't think it would be possible for human beings to fail to understandthe importance of retaining the very factors that are keeping themalive.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I don't have your pleasant faith in human reason,Pel. It seems to me to be quite conceivable that when a planetarysociety consists only of Isolates, local and even individual concernsmight easily be allowed to overcome planetary concerns.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't think that's conceivable,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;anymore thanPelorat does. In fact, since human-occupied worlds exist by the millionand none of them have deteriorated in an unterraforming fashion, yourfear of Isolatism may be exaggerated, Bliss.&quot;The ship now moved out of the daylit hemisphere into the night. Theeffect was that of a rapidly deepening twilight, and then utter darknessoutside, except for starlight where the sky was clear.<br />
  The ship maintained its height by accurately monitoring the atmosphericpressure and gravitational intensity. They were at a height too greatto encounter any upthrusting mountainous massif, for the planet wasat a stage when mountain-building had not recently taken place. Still,the computer felt its way forward with its microwave finger-tips, justin case.<br />
  Trevize regarded the velvety darkness and said, thoughtfully,&quot;Somehow what I find most convincing as the sign of a deserted planet isthe absence of visible light on the dark side. No technological societycould possibly endure darkness. As soon as we get into the dayside,we'll go lower.&quot;<br />
&quot;What would be the use of that?&quot; said Pelorat. &quot;There's nothingthere.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who said there's nothing there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Bliss did. And you did.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Janov. I said there's no radiation of technological origin andBliss said there's no sign of human mental activity, but that doesn'tmean there's nothing there. Even if there are no human beings on theplanet, there would surely be relics of some sort. I'm after information,Janov, and the remainders of a technology may have its uses in thatdirection.&quot;<br />
&quot;After twenty thousand years?&quot; Pelorat's voice climbed in pitch. &quot;Whatdo you think can survive twenty thousand years? There will be no films,no paper, no print; metal will have rusted, wood will have decayed,plastic will be in shattered grains. Even stone will have crumbledand eroded.&quot;<br />
&quot;It may not be twenty thousand years,&quot; said Trevize patiently. &quot;Imentioned that time as the longest period the planet may have beenleft empty of human beings because Comporellian legend has this worldflourishing at that time. But suppose the last human beings had died orvanished or fled only a thousand years ago.&quot;They arrived at the other end of the nightside and the dawn came andbrightened into sunlight almost instantaneously.<br />
  The Far Star sank downward and slowed its progress until thedetails of the land surface were clearly visible. The small islands thatdotted the continental shores could now be clearly seen. Most were greenwith vegetation.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;It's my idea that we ought to study the spoiledareas particularly. It seems to me that those places where human beingswere most concentrated would be where the ecological balance was mostlacking. Those areas might be the nucleus of the spreading blight ofunterraforming. What do you think, Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's possible. In any case, in the absence of definite knowledge,we might as well look where it's easiest to see. The grasslands andforest would have swallowed most signs of human habitation so thatlooking there might prove a waste of time.&quot;<br />
&quot;It strikes me,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that a world might eventuallyestablish a balance with what it has; that new species might develop;and that the bad areas might be recolonized on a new basis.&quot;<br />
&quot;Possibly, Pel,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;It depends on how badly out of balancethe world was in the first place. And for a world to heal itself andachieve a new balance through evolution would take far more than twentythousand years. We'd be talking millions of years.&quot;The Far Star was no longer circling the world. It was driftingslowly across a five-hundred-kilometer-wide stretch of scattered heathand furze, with occasional clumps of trees.<br />
  What do you think of that? said Trevize suddenly, pointing. Theship came to a drifting halt and hovered in mid-air. There was a low, butpersistent, hum as the gravitic engines shifted into high, neutralizingthe planetary gravitational field almost entirely.<br />
  There was nothing much to see where Trevize pointed. Tumbled moundsbearing soil and sparse grass were all that was visible.<br />
  It doesn't look like anything to me, said Pelorat.<br />
  There's a straight-line arrangement to that junk. Parallel lines,and you can make out some faint lines at right angles, too. See?      Youcan't get that in any natural formation. That's human architecture,marking out foundations and walls, just as clearly as though they werestill standing there to be looked at.&quot;Suppose it is, said Pelorat. &quot;That's just a ruin. If we'regoing to do archeological research, we're going to have to dig anddig. Professionals would take years to do it properly &quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but we can't take the time to do it properly. That may bethe faint outline of an ancient city and something of it may still bestanding. Let's follow those lines and see where they take us.&quot;It was toward one end of the area, at a place where the trees weresomewhat more thickly clumped, that they came to standing walls orpartially standing ones.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;Good enough for a beginning. We're landing.&quot;<br />
  Chapter 9 :Facing the Pack<br />
  35The Far Star came to rest at the bottom of a smallrise, a hill in the generally flat countryside. Almost without thought,Trevize had taken it for granted that it would be best for the ship notto be visible for miles in every direction.<br />
  He said, &quot;The temperature outside is 24 C., the wind is about elevenkilometers per hour from the west, and it is partly cloudy. The computerdoes not know enough about the general air circulation to be able topredict the weather. However, since the humidity is some forty percent,it seems scarcely about to rain. On the whole, we seem to have chosen acomfortable latitude or season of the year, and after Comporellon that'sa pleasure.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that as the planet continues tounterraform, the weather will become more extreme.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm sure of that,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  Be as sure as you like, said Trevize. &quot;We have thousands of yearsof leeway. Right now, it's still a pleasant planet and will continue tobe so for our lifetimes and far beyond.&quot;He was clasping a broad belt about his waist as he spoke, and Blisssaid sharply, &quot;What's that, Trevize?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just my old navy training,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I'm not going into anunknown world unarmed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you seriously intending to carry weapons?&quot;<br />
&quot;Absolutely. Here on my right&quot; he slapped a holster thatcontained a massive weapon with a broad muzzle &quot;is my blaster,and here on my left&quot; a smaller weapon with a thin muzzle thatcontained no opening &quot;is my neuronic whip.&quot;<br />
&quot;Two varieties of murder,&quot; said Bliss, with distaste.<br />
  Only one. The blaster kills. The neuronic whip doesn't. It juststimulates the pain nerves, and it hurts so that you can wish you weredead, I'm told. Fortunately, I've never been at the wrong end of one.&quot;Why are you taking them?&quot;I told you. It's an enemy world.&quot;Trevize, it's an empty world.&quot;Is it? There's no technological society, it would seem, but what ifthere are post-technological primitives. They may not possess anythingworse than clubs or rocks, but those can kill, too.Bliss looked exasperated, but lowered her voice in an effort to bereasonable. &quot;I detect no human neuronic activity, Trevize. That eliminatesprimitives of any type, post-technological or otherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then I won't have to use my weapons,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Still, what harmwould there be in carrying them? They'll just make me a little heavier,and since the gravitational pull at the surface is about ninety-onepercent that of Terminus, I can afford the weight. Listen,the ship may be unarmed as a ship, but it has a reasonable supply ofhand-weapons. I suggest that you two also &quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Bliss at once. &quot;I will not make even a gesture in thedirection of killing or of inflicting pain, either.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's not a question of killing, but of avoiding being killed, ifyou see what I mean.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can protect myself in my own way.&quot;<br />
&quot;Janov?&quot;Pelorat hesitated. &quot;We didn't have arms on Comporellon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come, Janov, Comporellon was a known quantity, a world associatedwith the Foundation. Besides we were at once taken into custody. If we hadhad weapons, they would have been taken away. Do you want a blaster?&quot;Pelorat shook his head. &quot;I've never been in the Navy, old chap. Iwouldn't know how to use one of those things and, in an emergency, I wouldnever think of it in time. I'd just run and and get killed.&quot;<br />
&quot;You won't get killed, Pel,&quot; said Bliss energetically. &quot;Gaia has youin my/our/its protection, and that posturing naval hero as well.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Good. I have no objection to being protected, but I amnot posturing. I am simply making assurance doubly sure, and if I neverhave to make a move toward these things, I'll be completely pleased,I promise you. Still I must have them.&quot;He patted both weapons affectionately and said, &quot;Now let's step outon this world which may not have felt the weight of human beings uponits surface for thousands of years.&quot;36&quot;I have a feeling,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that it must berather late in the day, but the sun is high enough to make it near noon,perhaps.&quot;<br />
&quot;I suspect,&quot; said Trevize, looking about the quiet panorama, &quot;thatyour feeling originates out of the sun's orange tint, which gives it asunset feel. If we're still here at actual sunset and the cloud formationsare proper, we ought to experience a deeper red than we're used to. Idon't know whether you'll find it beautiful or depressing. Forthat matter it was probably even more extreme on Comporellon, but therewe were indoors virtually all the time.&quot;He turned slowly, considering the surroundings in all directions. Inaddition to the almost subliminal oddness of the light, there was thedistinctive smell of the world or this section of it. It seemeda little musty, but far from actively unpleasant.<br />
  The trees nearby were of middling height, and looked old, with gnarledbark and trunks a little off the vertical, though because of a prevailingwind or something off-color about the soil he couldn't tell. Was itthe trees that lent a somehow menacing ambience to the world or was itsomething else less material?<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;What do you intend to do, Trevize? Surely we didn't comeall this distance to enjoy the view?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Actually, perhaps that ought to be my part of it justnow. I would suggest that Janov explore this place. There are ruinsoff in that direction and he's the one who can judge the value of anyrecords he might find. I imagine he can understand writings or films inarchaic Galactic and I know quite well I wouldn't. And I suppose, Bliss,you want to go with him in order to protect him. As for me, I will stayhere as a guard on the outer rim.&quot;<br />
&quot;A guard against what? Primitives with rocks and clubs?&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps.&quot; And then the smile that had hovered about his lips fadedand he said, &quot;Oddly enough, Bliss, I'm a little uneasy about this place. Ican't say why.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Come, Bliss. I've been a home-body collector ofold tales all my life, so I've never actually put my hands on ancientdocuments. Just imagine if we could find &quot;Trevize watched them walk away, Pelorat's voice fading as he walkedeagerly toward the ruins; Bliss swinging along at his side.<br />
  Trevize listened absently and then turned back to continue his studyof the surroundings. What could there be to rouse apprehension?<br />
  He had never actually set foot upon a world without a human population,but he had viewed many from space. Usually, they were small worlds, notlarge enough to hold either water or air, but they had been useful asmarking a meeting site during naval maneuvers (there had been no war inhis lifetime, or for a century before his birth but maneuvers went on),or as an exercise in simulated emergency repairs. Ships he had been onhad been in orbit about such worlds, or had even rested on them, but hehad never had occasion to step off the ships at those times.<br />
  Was it that he was now actually standing on an empty world? Would hehave felt the same if he had been standing on one of the many small,airless worlds he had encountered in his student days and evensince?<br />
  He shook his head. It wouldn't have bothered him. He was sure ofthat. He would have been in a space suit, as he had been innumerabletimes when he was free of his ship in space. It was a familiar situationand contact with a mere lump of rock would have produced no alterationin the familiarity. Surely!<br />
  Of course He was not wearing a space suit now.<br />
  He was standing on a habitable world, as comfortable to the feel asTerminus would be far more comfortable than Comporellon had been. Heexperienced the wind against his cheek, the warmth of the sun on his back,the rustle of vegetation in his ears. Everything was familiar, exceptthat there were no human beings on it at least, not any longer.<br />
  Was that it? Was it that that made the world seem so eerie? Was itthat it was not merely an uninhabited world, but a deserted one?<br />
  He had never been on a deserted world before; never heard of a desertedworld before; never thought a world could be deserted. Allthe worlds he had known of till now, once they had been populated byhuman beings, remained so populated forever.<br />
  He looked up toward the sky. Nothing else had deserted it. Anoccasional bird flew across his line of vision, seeming more natural,somehow, than the slate-blue sky between the orange-tinted fair-weatherclouds. (Trevize was certain that, given a few days on the planet, hewould become accustomed to the off-color so that sky and clouds wouldgrow to seem normal to him.)He heard birdsongs from the trees, and the softer noise ofinsects. Bliss had mentioned butterflies earlier and here theywere in surprising numbers and in several colorful varieties.<br />
  There were also occasional rustlings in the clumps of grass thatsurrounded the trees, but he could not quite make out what was causingthem.<br />
  Nor did the obvious presence of life in his vicinity rouse fear inhim. As Bliss had said, terraformed worlds had, from the very first,lacked dangerous animals. The fairy tales of childhood, and the heroicfantasies of his teenage years were invariably set on a legendary worldthat must have been derived from the vague myths of Earth. The hyperdramaholoscreen had been filled with monsters lions, unicorns, dragons,whales, brontosaurs, bears. There were dozens of them with names hecould not remember; some of them surely mythical, and perhaps all ofthem. There were smaller animals that bit and stung, even plants thatwere fearful to the touch but only in fiction. He had once heardthat primitive honeybees were able to sting, but certainly no red beeswere in any way harmful.<br />
  Slowly, he walked to the right, skirting the border of the hill. Thegrass was tall and rank, but sparse, growing in clumps. He made his wayamong the trees, also growing in clumps.<br />
  Then he yawned. Certainly, nothing exciting was happening, andhe wondered if he might not retreat to the ship and take a nap. No,unthinkable. Clearly, he had to stand on guard.<br />
  Perhaps he ought to do sentry duty-marching, one, two, one two,swinging about with a snap and performing complicated maneuverings witha parade electro-rod. (It was a weapon no warrior had used in threecenturies, but it was still absolutely essential at drill, for no reasonanyone could ever advance.)He grinned at the thought of it, then wondered if he ought to joinPelorat and Bliss in the ruins. Why? What good would he do?<br />
  Suppose he saw something that Pelorat had happened tooverlook? Well, time enough to make the attempt after Peloratreturned. If there was anything that might be found easily, by all meanslet Pelorat make the discovery.<br />
  Might the two be in trouble? Foolish! What possible kind oftrouble?<br />
  And if there were trouble, they would call out.<br />
  He stopped to listen. He heard nothing.<br />
  And then the irresistible thought of sentry duty recurred to himand he found himself marching, feet moving up and down with a stamp,an imaginary electro-rod coming off one shoulder, whirling, and beingheld out straight before him, exactly vertical-whirling again, end overend, and back over the other shoulder. Then, with a smart about-face,he was looking toward the ship (rather far-off now) once more.<br />
  And when he did that, he froze in reality, and not in sentrymake-believe.<br />
  He was not alone.<br />
  Until then, he had not seen any living creature other than plantgrowth, insects, and an occasional bird. He had neither seen nor heardanything approach but now an animal stood between him and theship.<br />
  Sheer surprise at the unexpected event deprived him, for a moment, ofthe ability to interpret what he saw. It was not till after a perceptibleinterval that he knew what he was looking at.<br />
  It was only a dog.<br />
  Trevize was not a dog person. He had never owned a dog and hefelt no surge of friendliness toward one when he encountered it. Hefelt no such surge this time, either. He thought, rather impatiently,that there was no world on which these creatures had not accompaniedmen. They existed in countless varieties and Trevize had long had theweary impression that each world had at least one variety characteristicof itself. Nevertheless, all varieties were constant in this: whether theywere kept for entertainment, show, or some form of useful work theywere bred to love and trust human beings.<br />
  It was a love and trust Trevize had never appreciated. He had oncelived with a woman who had had a dog. That dog, whom Trevize toleratedfor the sake of the woman, conceived a deep-seated adoration for him,followed him about, leaned against him when relaxing (all fifty poundsof him), covered him with saliva and hair at unexpected moments, andsquatted outside the door and moaned whenever he and the woman weretrying to engage in sex.<br />
  From that experience, Trevize had emerged with the firm convictionthat for some reason known only to the canine mind and its odor-analyzingability, he was a fixed object of doggish devotion.<br />
  Therefore, once the initial surprise was over, he surveyed thedog without concern. It was a large dog, lean and rangy, and with longlegs. It was staring at him with no obvious sign of adoration. Its mouthwas open in what might have been taken as a welcoming grin, but theteeth displayed were somehow large and dangerous, and Trevize decidedthat he would be more comfortable without the dog in his line of view.<br />
  It occurred to him, then, that the dog had never seen a human being,and that countless canine generations preceding had never seen one. Thedog might have been as astonished and uncertain at the sudden appearanceof a human being as Trevize had been at that of the dog. Trevize, atleast, had quickly recognized the dog for what it was, but the dog didnot have that advantage. It was still puzzled, and perhaps alarmed.<br />
  Clearly, it would not be safe to leave an animal that large, andwith such teeth, in an alarmed state. Trevize realized that it would benecessary to establish a friendship at once.<br />
  Very slowly, he approached the dog (no sudden motions, of course). Heheld out his hand, ready to allow it to be sniffed, and made soft,soothing sounds, most of which consisted of &quot;Nice doggy&quot; somethinghe found intensely embarrassing.<br />
  The dog, eyes fixed on Trevize, backed away a step or two, as thoughin distrust, and then its upper lip wrinkled into a snarl and from itsmouth there issued a rasping growl. Although Trevize had never seen a dogbehave so, there was no way of interpreting the action as representinganything but menace.<br />
  Trevize therefore stopped advancing and froze. His eyes caughtmotion to one side, and his head turned slowly. There were two otherdogs advancing from that direction. They looked just as deadly as thefirst.<br />
  Deadly? That adjective occurred to him only now, and its dreadfulappropriateness was unmistakable.<br />
  His heart was suddenly pounding. The way to the ship was blocked. Hecould not run aimlessly, for those long canine legs would reach him inyards. If he stood his ground and used his blaster, then while he killedone, the other two would be upon him. Off in the distance, he could seeother dogs approaching. Was there some way in which they communicated? Didthey hunt in packs?<br />
  Slowly, he shifted ground leftward, in a direction in which therewere no dogs as yet. Slowly.........<br />
  The dogs shifted ground with him. He felt certain that all that savedhim from instant attack was the fact that the dogs had never seen orsmelled anything like himself before. They had no established behaviorpattern they could follow in his case.<br />
  If he ran, of course, that would represent something familiar to thedogs. They would know what to do if something the size of Trevize showedfear and ran. They would run, too. Faster.<br />
  Trevize kept sidling toward a tree. He had the wildest desire to moveupward where the dogs could not follow. They moved with him, snarlingsoftly, coming closer. All three had their eyes fixed unwinkingly uponhim. Two more were joining them and, farther off, Trevize could seestill other dogs approaching. At some point, when he was close enough,he would have to make the dash. He could not wait too long, or run toosoon. Either might be fatal.<br />
  Now!<br />
  He probably set a personal record for acceleration and even so it wasa near thing. He felt the snap of jaws close on the heel of one foot,and for just moment he was held fast before the teeth slid off thetough ceramoid.<br />
  He was not skilled at climbing trees. He had not climbed one since hewas ten and, as he recalled, that had been a clumsy effort. In this case,though, the trunk was not quite vertical, and the bark was gnarled andoffered handholds. What was more, he was driven by necessity, and it isremarkable what one can do if the need is great enough.<br />
  Trevize found himself sitting in a crotch, perhaps ten meters aboveground. For the moment he was totally unaware that he had scraped handand that it was oozing blood. At the base of the tree, five dogs now ontheir haunches, staring upward, tongues lolling, all looking patientlyexpectant.<br />
  What now?<br />
  37Trevize was not in a position to think about thesituation in logical detail. Rather, he experienced flashes of thought inodd and distorted sequence which, if he had eventually sorted them out,would have come to this Bliss had earlier maintained that in terraforming a planet, humanbeings would establish an unbalanced economy, which they would be able tokeep from falling apart only by unending effort. For instance, no Settlershad brought with them any of the large predators. Small ones could not behelped. Insects, parasites even small hawks, shrews, and so on.<br />
  Those dramatic animals of legend and vague literaryaccounts tigers, grizzly bears, orcs, crocodiles? Who would carrythem from world to world even if there were sense to it? And where wouldthere be sense to it?<br />
  It meant that human beings were the only large predators, and it wasup to them to cull those plants and animals that, left to themselves,would smother in their own overplenty.<br />
  And if human beings somehow vanished, then other predators must taketheir place. But what predators? The most sizable predators toleratedby human beings were dogs and cats, tamed and living on human bounty.<br />
  What if no human beings remained to feed them? They must thenfind their own food for their survival and, in all truth, forthe survival of those they preyed on, whose numbers had to be kept incheck lest overpopulation do a hundred times the damage that predationswould do.<br />
  So dogs would multiply, in their variations, with the large onesattacking the large, untended herbivores; the smaller ones preying onbirds and rodents. Cats would prey by night as dogs did by day; theformer singly, the latter in packs.<br />
  And perhaps evolution would eventually produce more varieties, tofill additional environmental niches. Would some dogs eventually developsea-going characteristics to enable them to live on fish; and would somecats develop gliding abilities to hunt the clumsier birds in the air aswell as on the ground?<br />
  In flashes, all this came to Trevize while he struggled with moresystematic thought to tell him what he might do.<br />
  The number of dogs kept growing. He counted twenty-three nowsurrounding the tree and there were others approaching. How large wasthe pack? What did it matter? It was large enough already.<br />
  He withdrew his blaster from its holster, but the solid feel of thebutt in his hand did not give him the sense of security he would haveliked. When had he last inserted an energy unit into it and how manycharges could he fire? Surely not twenty-three.<br />
  What about Pelorat and Bliss? If they emerged, would the dogs turnon them? Were they safe even if they did not emerge? If the dogs sensedthe presence of two human beings inside the ruins, what could stop themfrom attacking them there? Surely there would be no doors or barriersto hold them off.<br />
  Could Bliss stop them, and even drive them away? Could she concentrateher powers through hyperspace to the desired pitch of intensity? Forhow long could she maintain them?<br />
  Should he call for help then? Would they come running if he yelled,and would the dogs flee under Bliss's glare? (Would it take a glare orwas it simply a mental action undetectable to onlookers without theability?) Or, if they appeared, would they then be torn apart underthe eyes of Trevize, who would be forced to watch, helplessly, from therelative safety of his post in the tree?<br />
  No, he would have to use his blaster. If he could kill one dog andfrighten them off for just a while, he could scramble down the tree,yell for Pelorat and Bliss, kill a second dog if they showed signs ofreturning, and all three could then hustle into the ship.<br />
  He adjusted the intensity of the microwave beam to the three-quartermark. That should be ample to kill a dog with a loud report. The reportwould serve to frighten the dogs away, and he would be conservingenergy.<br />
  He aimed carefully at a dog in the middle of the pack, one who seemed(in Trevize's own imagination, at least) to exude a greater malignancythan the rest perhaps only because he sat more quietly and,therefore, seemed more cold-bloodedly intent on his prey. The dog wasstaring directly at the weapon now, as though it scorned the worstTrevize could do.<br />
  It occurred to Trevize that he had never himself fired a blasterat a human being, or seen anyone else do it. There had been firing atwater-filled dummies of leather and plastic during training; with thewater almost instantaneously heated to the boiling point, and shreddingthe covering as it exploded.<br />
  But who, in the absence of war, would fire at a human being? Andwhat human being would withstand a blaster and force its use? Only here,on world made pathological by the disappearance of human beings With that odd ability of the brain to note something utterly besidethe point, Trevize was aware of the fact that a cloud had hidden thesun-and then he fired.<br />
  There was an odd shimmer of the atmosphere on a straight line fromthe muzzle of the blaster to the dog; a vague sparkle that might havegone unnoticed if the sun were still shining unhindered.<br />
  The dog must have felt the initial surge of heat, and made thesmallest motion as though it were about to leap. And then it exploded,as a portion its blood and cellular contents vaporized.<br />
  The explosion made a disappointingly small noise, for the dog'sintegument was simply not as tough as that of the dummies they hadpracticed on. Flesh, skin, blood, and bone were scattered, however,and Trevize felt his stomach heave.<br />
  The dogs started back, some having been bombarded with uncomfortablywarm fragments. That was only a momentary hesitation, however. Theycrowded against each other suddenly, in order to eat what had beenprovided. Trevize felt his sickness increase. He was not frighteningthem; he was feeding them. At that rate, they would never leave. In fact,the smell of fresh blood and warm meat would attract still more dogs,and perhaps other smaller predators as well.<br />
  A voice called out, &quot;Trevize. What &quot;Trevize looked outward. Bliss and Pelorat had emerged from theruins. Bliss had stopped short, her arms thrown out to keep Peloratback. She stared at the dogs. The situation was obvious and clear. Shehad to ask nothing.<br />
  Trevize shouted, &quot;I tried to drive them off without involving youand Janov. Can you hold them off?&quot;<br />
&quot;Barely,&quot; said Bliss, not shouting, so that Trevize had troublehearing her even though the dogs' snarling had quieted as though asoothing soundabsorbent blanket had been thrown over them.<br />
  Bliss said, &quot;There are too many of them, and I am not familiar withtheir pattern of neuronic activity. We have no such savage things onGaia.&quot;<br />
&quot;Or on Terminus. Or on any civilized world,&quot; shouted Trevize. &quot;I'llshoot as many of them as I can and you try to handle the rest. A smallernumber will give you less trouble.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Trevize. Shooting them will just attract others. Staybehind me, Pel. There's no way you can protect me. Trevize, yourother weapon.&quot;<br />
&quot;The neuronic whip?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. That produces pain. Low power. Low power!&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you afraid of hurting them?&quot; called out Trevize in anger. &quot;Isthis a time to consider the sacredness of life?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm considering Pel's. Also mine. Do as I say. Low power, and shootat one of the dogs. I can't hold them much longer.&quot;The dogs had drifted away from the tree and had surrounded Bliss andPelorat, who stood with their backs to a crumbling wall. The dogs nearestthe two made hesitant attempts to come closer still, whining a bit asthough trying to puzzle out what it was that held them off when theycould sense nothing that would do it. Some tried uselessly to scrambleup the wall and attack from behind.<br />
  Trevize's hand was trembling as he adjusted the neuronic whip to lowpower. The neuronic whip used much less energy than the blaster did,and a single power-cartridge could produce hundreds of whip-like strokesbut, come to think of it, he didn't remember when he had last chargedthis weapon, either.<br />
  It was not so important to aim the whip. Since conserving energy wasnot as critical, he could use it in a sweep across the mass of dogs. Thatwas the traditional method of controlling crowds that showed signs ofturning dangerous.<br />
  However, he followed Bliss's suggestion. He aimed at one dogand fired. The dog fell over, its legs twitching. It emitted loud,high-pitched squeals.<br />
  The other dogs backed away from the stricken beast, ears flatteningbackward against their heads. Then, squealing in their turn, they turnedand left, at first slowly, then more rapidly, and finally, at a fullrace. The dog who had been hit, scrambled painfully to its legs, andlimped away whimpering, much the last of them.<br />
  The noise vanished in the distance, and Bliss said, &quot;We had betterget into the ship. They will come back. Or others will.&quot;Trevize thought that never before had he manipulated the ship's entrymechanism so rapidly. And it was possible he might never do so again.<br />
  38Night had fallen before Trevize felt somethingapproaching the normal. The small patch of syntho-skin on the scrape onhis hand had soothed the physical pain, but there was a scrape on hispsyche for which soothing was not so easy.<br />
  It was not the mere exposure to danger. He could react to that as wellas any ordinarily brave person might. It was the totally unlooked-fordirection from which the danger had come. It was the feeling of theridiculous. How would it look if people were to find out he had beentreed by snarling dogs ? It would scarcely be worse if hehad been put to flight by the whirring of angry canaries.<br />
  For hours, he kept listening for a new attack on the part of thedogs, for ths, sound of howls, for the scratch of claws against theouter hull.<br />
  Pelorat, by comparison, seemed quite cool. &quot;There was no question inmy mind, old chap, that Bliss would handle it, but I must say you firedthe weapon well.&quot;Trevize shrugged. He was in no mood to discuss the matter.<br />
  Pelorat was holding his library the one compact disc on whichhis lifetime of research into myths and legends were stored andwith it he retreated into his bedroom where he kept his small reader.<br />
  He seemed quite pleased with himself. Trevize noticed that but didn'tfollow it up. Time for that later when his mind wasn't quite as takenup with dogs.<br />
  Bliss said, rather tentatively, when the two were alone, &quot;I presumeyou were taken by surprise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Quite,&quot; said Trevize gloomily. &quot;Who would think that at the sightof a dog a dog  I should run for my life.&quot;<br />
&quot;Twenty thousand years without men and it would not be quite a dog.<br />
  Those beasts must now be the dominant large predators.&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;I figured that out while I was sitting on thetree branch being a dominated prey. You were certainly right about anunbalanced ecology.&quot;<br />
&quot;Unbalanced, certainly, from the human standpoint but consideringhow efficiently the dogs seem to be going about their business, I wonderif Pel may be right in his suggestion that the ecology could balanceitself, with various environmental niches being filled by evolvingvariations of the relatively few species that were once brought tothe world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oddly enough,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;the same thought occurred to me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Provided, of course, the unbalance is not so great that the processof righting itself takes too long. The planet might become completelynonviable before that.&quot;Trevize grunted.<br />
  Bliss looked at him thoughtfully, &quot;How is it that you thought ofarming yourself?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;It did me little good. It was your ability &quot;<br />
&quot;Not entirely. I needed your weapon. At short notice, with onlyhyperspatial contact with the rest of Gaia, with so many individualminds of so unfamiliar a nature, I could have done nothing without yourneuronic whip.&quot;<br />
&quot;My blaster was useless. I tried that.&quot;<br />
&quot;With a blaster, Trevize, a dog merely disappears. The rest may besurprised, but not frightened.&quot;<br />
&quot;Worse than that,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;They ate the remnants. I was bribingthem to stay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I see that might be the effect. The neuronic whip isdifferent. It inflicts pain, and a dog in pain emits cries of a kind thatare well understood by other dogs who, by conditioned reflex, if nothingelse, begin to feel frightened themselves. With the dogs already disposedtoward fright, I merely nudged their minds, and off they went.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but you realized the whip was the more deadly of the two inthis case. I did not.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am accustomed to dealing with minds. You are not. That's why Iinsisted on low power and aiming at one dog. I did not want so much painthat it killed a dog and left him silent. I did not want the pain sodispersed as to cause mere whimpering. I wanted strong pain concentratedat one point.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you got it, Bliss,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;It worked perfectly. I oweyou considerable gratitude.&quot;<br />
&quot;You begrudge that,&quot; said Bliss thoughtfully, &quot;because it seems to youthat you played a ridiculous role. And yet, I repeat, I could have donenothing without your weapons. What puzzles me is how you can explainyour arming yourself in the face of my assurance that there were nohuman beings on this world, something I am still certain is a fact. Didyou foresee the dogs?&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I certainly didn't. Not consciously, at least. AndI don't habitually go armed, either. It never even occurred to me to puton weapons at Comporellon. But I can't allow myself to trip intothe trap of feeling it was magic, either. It couldn't have been. I suspectthat once we began talking about unbalanced ecologies earlier, I somehowhad an unconscious glimpse of animals grown dangerous in the absence ofhuman beings. That is clear enough in hindsight, but I might have had a whiff of it in foresight. Nothing more than that.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Don't dismiss it that casually. I participated in thesame conversation concerning unbalanced ecologies and I didn't havethat same foresight. It is that special trick of foresight in you thatGaia values. I can see, too, that it must be irritating to you to havea hidden foresight the nature of which you cannot detect; to act withdecision, but without clear reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;The usual expression on Terminus is `to act on a hunch.'&quot;<br />
&quot;On Gaia we say, `to know without thought.' You don't like knowingwithout thought, do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;It bothers me, yes. I don't like being driven by hunches. I assumehunch has reason behind it, but not knowing the reason makes me feelI'm not in control of my own mind a kind of mild madness.&quot;<br />
&quot;And when you decided in favor of Gaia and Galaxia, you were actingon s hunch, and now you seek the reason.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have said so at least a dozen times.&quot;<br />
&quot;And I have refused to accept your statement as literal truth. Forthat I am sorry. I will oppose you in this no longer. I hope, though,that I may continue to point out items in Gaia's favor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;if you, in turn, recognize that I may notaccept them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Does it occur to you, then, that this Unknown World is reverting to akind of savagery, and perhaps to eventual desolation and uninhabitability,because of the removal of a single species that is capable of acting asa guiding intelligence? If the world were Gaia, or better yet, a part ofGalaxia, this could not happen. The guiding intelligence would still existin the form of the Galaxy as a whole, and ecology, whenever unbalanced,and for whatever reason, would move toward balance again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Does that mean that dogs would no longer eat?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course they would eat, just as human beings do. They would however,with purpose, in order to balance the ecology under deliberate direction,and not as a result of random circumstance.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;The loss of individual freedom might not matter to dogs,but it must matter to human beings. And what if all human beings were removed from existence, everywhere, and not merelyon one world or on several? What if Galaxia were left without humanbeings at all? Would there still be a guiding intelligence? Would allother life forms and inanimate matter be able to put together a commonintelligence adequate for the purpose?&quot;Bliss hesitated. &quot;Such a situation,&quot; she said, &quot;has never beenexperienced. Nor does there seem any likelihood that it will ever beexperienced in the future.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Hut doesn't it seem obvious to you, that the humanmind is qualitatively different from everything else, and that if itwere absent, the sum total of all other consciousness could not replaceit. Would it not be true, then, that human beings are a special case andmust be treated as such? They should not be fused even with one another,let alone with nonhuman objects.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yet you decided in favor of Galaxia.&quot;<br />
&quot;For an overriding reason I cannot make out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perhaps that overriding reason was a glimpse of the effect ofunbalanced ecologies? Might it not have been your reasoning that everyworld in the Galaxy is on a knife-edge, with instability on either side,and that only Galaxia could prevent such disasters as are taking placeon this world to say nothing of the continuing interhuman disastersof war and administrative failure.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Unbalanced ecologies were not in my mind at the time of mydecision.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can you be sure?&quot;<br />
&quot;I may not know what it is I'm foreseeing, but if something issuggested afterward, I would recognize it if that were indeed what Iforesaw. As it seems to me I may have foreseen dangerous animalson this world.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Bliss soberly, &quot;we might have been dead as a resultof those dangerous animals if it had not been for a combination ofour powers, your foresight and my mentalism. Come, then, let us befriends.&quot;Trevize nodded. &quot;If you wish.&quot;There was a chill in his voice that caused Bliss's eyebrows to rise,but at this point Pelorat burst in, nodding his head as though preparedto shake it off its foundations.<br />
  I think, he said, &quot;we have it.&quot;39Trevize did not, in general, believe in easy victories,and yet it was only human to fall into belief against one's betterjudgment. He felt the muscles in his chest and throat tighten, but managedto say, &quot;The location of Earth? Have you discovered that, Janov?&quot;Pelorat stared at Trevize for a moment, and deflated. &quot;Well, no,&quot;he said, visibly abashed. &quot;Not quite that. Actually, Golan, notthat aaaall. I had forgotten about that. It was something else that Idiscovered in the ruins. I suppose it's not really important.&quot;Trevize managed a long breath and said, &quot;Never mind, Janov. Everyfinding is important. What was it you came in to say?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;it's just that almost nothing survived,you understand. Twenty thousand years of storm and wind don't leavemuch. What's more, plant life is gradually destructive and animallife But never mindaall that. The point is that `almost nothing'<br />
  is not the same as `nothing.'<br />
  The ruins must have included a public building, for there was somefallen stone, or concrete, with incised lettering upon it. There washardly anything visible, you understand, old chap, but I took photographswith one of those cameras we have on board ship, the kind with built-incomputer enhancement I never got round to asking permission totake one, Golan, but it was important, and I Trevize waved his hand in impatient dismissal. &quot;Go on!&quot;<br />
&quot;I could make out some of the lettering, which was very archaic. Evenwith computer enhancement and with my own fair skill at reading Archaic,it was impossible to make out much except for one short phrase. Theletters there were larger and a bit clearer than the rest. They may havebeen incised more deeply because they identified the world itself. Thephrase reads, `Planet Aurora,' so I imagine this world we rest upon isnamed Aurora, or was named Aurora.&quot;<br />
&quot;It had to be named something,&quot; said Trevize.<br />
  &quot;Yes, but names are very rarely chosen at random. I made a carefulsearch of my library just now and there are two old legends, from twowidely spaced worlds, as it happens, so that one can reasonably supposethem to be of independent origin, if one remembers that. But nevermind that. In both legends, Aurora is used as a name for the dawn. Wecan suppose that Aurora may have actually meant dawn insome pre-Galactic language.<br />
  As it happens, some word for dawn or daybreak is often used as aname for space stations or other structures that are the first built oftheir kind. If this world is called Dawn in whatever language, it maybe the first of its kind, too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize said, &quot;<br />
&quot;Are you getting ready to suggest that this planet isEarth and that Aurora is an alternate name for it because it representsthe dawn of life and of man?&quot;<br />
&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;<br />
&quot;I couldn't go that far, Golan.&quot;<br />
&quot;Trevize said, with a trace of bitterness, &quot;<br />
&quot;There is, after all,no radioactive surface, no giant satellite, no gas giant with hugerings.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly. But Deniador, back on Comporellon, seemed to think thiswas one of the worlds that was once inhabited by the first wave ofSettlers the Spacers. If it were, then its name, Aurora, mightindicate it to have been the first of those Spacer worlds. We might,at this very moment, be resting on the oldest human world in the Galaxyexcept for Earth itself. Isn't that exciting?&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Interesting, at any rate, Janov, but isn't that a great deal toinfer merely from the name, Aurora?&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;There's more,&quot;<br />
&quot; said Pelorat excitedly. &quot;<br />
&quot;As far as I could checkin my records there is no world in the Galaxy today with the name of`Aurora,' and I'm sure your computer will verify that. As I said, thereare all sorts of world and other objects named `Dawn' in various ways,but no one uses the actual word `Aurora.'&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;Why should they? If it's a pre-Galactic word, it wouldn't be likelyto be popular.&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;But names do remain, even when they're meaningless. Ifthis were the first settled world, it would be famous; it might even,for a while, have been the dominant world of the Galaxy. Surely, therewould be other worlds calling themselves `New Aurora,' or `Aurora Minor,'&quot;<br />
  or something like that. And then others &quot;Trevize broke in. &quot;Perhaps it wasn't the first settled world. Perhapsit was never of any importance.&quot;<br />
&quot;There's a better reason in my opinion, my dear chap.&quot;<br />
&quot;What would that be, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;If the first wave of settlements was overtaken by a second waveto which all the worlds of the Galaxy now belong as Deniadorsaid then there is very likely to have been a period of hostilitybetween the two waves. The second wave making up the worlds thatnow exist would not use the names given to any of the worlds ofthe first wave. In that way, we can infer from the fact that the name`Aurora' has never been repeated that there were two waves of Settlers,and that this is a world of the first wave.&quot;Trevize smiled. &quot;I'm getting a glimpse of how you mythologists work,Janov. You build a beautiful superstructure, but it may be standingon air. The legends tell us that the Settlers of the first wave wereaccompanied by numerous robots, and that these were supposed to be theirundoing. Now if we could find a robot on this world, I'd be willingto accept all this first-wave supposition, but we can't expect aftertwenty thou &quot;Pelorat, whose mouth had been working, managed to find his voice. &quot;But,Golan, haven't I told you? No, of course, I haven't. I'm soexcited I can't put things in the right order. There was a robot.&quot;40Trevize rubbed his forehead, almost as though he werein pain. He said, &quot;A robot? There was a robot?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pelorat, nodding his head emphatically.<br />
  How do you know?&quot;Why, it was a robot. How could I fail to know one if I see one?&quot;Have you ever seen a robot before?&quot;No, but it was a metal object that looked like a human being. Head,arms, legs, torso. Of course, when I say metal, it was mostly rust, andwhen I walked toward it, I suppose the vibration of my tread damaged itfurther, so that when I reached to touch it &quot;Why should you touch it?&quot;Well, I suppose I couldn't quite believe my eyes. It was an automaticresponse. As soon as I touched it, it crumbled. But &quot;Yes?&quot;Before it quite did, its eyes seemed to glow very faintly and itmade a sound as though it were trying to say something.&quot;You mean it was still functioning ?&quot;Just barely, Golan. Then it collapsed.Trevize turned to Bliss. &quot;Do you corroborate all this, Bliss?&quot;<br />
&quot;It was a robot, and we saw it,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  And was it still functioning?Bliss said tonelessly, &quot;As it crumbled, I caught a faint sense ofneuronic activity.&quot;<br />
&quot;How can there have been neuronic activity? A robot doesn't have anorganic brain built of cells.&quot;<br />
&quot;It has the computerized equivalent, I imagine,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;and Iwould detect that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you detect a robotic rather than a human mentality?&quot;Bliss pursed her lips and said, &quot;It was too feeble to decide anythingabout it except that it was there.&quot;Trevize looked at Bliss, then at Pelorat, and said, in a tone ofexasperation, &quot;This changes everything.&quot;<br />
  Part Four - Solaria Chapter 10: Robots<br />
  41Trevize seemed lost in thought during dinner, and Blissconcentrated on the food.<br />
  Pelorat, the only one who seemed anxious to speak, pointed out that ifthe world they were on was Aurora and if it was the first settled world,it ought to be fairly close to Earth.<br />
  It might pay to scour the immediate stellar neighborhood, hesaid. &quot;It would only mean sifting through a few hundred stars atmost.&quot;Trevize muttered that hit-and-miss was a last resort and he wanted asmuch information about Earth as possible before attempting to approachit even if he found it. He said no more and Pelorat, clearly squelched,dwindled into silence as well.<br />
  After the meal, as Trevize continued to volunteer nothing, Peloratsaid tentatively, &quot;Are we to be staying here, Golan?&quot;<br />
&quot;Overnight, anyway,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;I need to do a bit morethinking.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is it safe?&quot;<br />
&quot;Unless there's something worse than dogs about,&quot; said Trevize,&quot;we're quite safe here in the ship.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;How long would it take to lift off, if there issomething worse than dogs about?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;The computer is on launch alert. I think we can manageto take off in between two and three minutes. And it will warn us quiteeffectively if anything unexpected takes place, so I suggest we allget some sleep. Tomorrow morning, I'll come to a decision as to thenext move.&quot;Easy to say, thought Trevize, as he found himself staring at thedarkness. He was curled up, partly dressed, on the floor of the computerroom. It was quite uncomfortable, but he was sure that his bed would beno more conducive to sleep at this time and here at least he could takeaction at once if the computer sounded an alarm.<br />
  Then he heard footsteps and automatically sat up, hitting his headagainst the edge of the desk not hard enough to do damage, buthard enough to make rubbing and grimacing a necessity.<br />
  Janov? he said in a muffled voice, eyes tearing.<br />
  No. It's Bliss.Trevize reached over the edge of the table with one hand to make atleast semicontact with the computer, and a soft light showed Bliss ina light pink wraparound.<br />
  Trevize said, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I looked in your bedroom and you weren't there. There was no mistakingyour neuronic activity, however, and I followed it. You were clearlyawake so I walked in.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, but what is it you want?&quot;She sat down against the wall, knees up, and cradled her chin againstthem. She said, &quot;Don't be concerned. I have no designs on what's leftof your virginity.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't imagine you do,&quot; said Trevize sardonically. &quot;Why aren't youasleep? You need it more than we do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Believe me,&quot; she said in a low, heartfelt tone, &quot;that episode withthe dogs was very draining.&quot;<br />
&quot;I believe that.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I had to talk to you when Pel was sleeping.&quot;<br />
&quot;About what?&quot;Bliss said, &quot;When he told you about the robot, you said that thatchanges everything. What did you mean?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Don't you see that for yourself? We have three setsof coordinates; three Forbidden Worlds. I want to visit all three tolearn as much as possible about Earth before trying to reach it.&quot;He edged a bit closer so that he could speak lower still, then drewaway sharply. He said, &quot;Look, I don't want Janov coming in here lookingfor us. I don't know what he'd think.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's not likely. He's sleeping and I've encouraged that just a bit. Ifhe stirs, I'll know. Go on. You want to visit all three. What'schanged?&quot;<br />
&quot;It wasn't part of my plan to waste time on any world needlessly. Ifthis world, Aurora, had been without human occupation for twenty thousandyears, then it is doubtful that any information of value has survived. Idon't want to spend weeks or months scrabbling uselessly about theplanetary surface, fighting off dogs and cats and bulls or whatever elsemay have become wild and dangerous, just on the hope of finding a scrap ofreference material amid the dust, rust, and decay. It may be that on oneor both of the other Forbidden Worlds there may be human beings and intactlibraries. So it was my intention to leave this world at once. We'dbe out in space now, if I had done so, sleeping in perfect security.&quot;<br />
&quot;But?&quot;<br />
&quot;But if there are robots still functioning on this world, they mayhave important information that we could use. They would be safer todeal with than human beings would be, since, from what I've heard,they must follow orders and can't harm human beings.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you've changed your plan and now you're going to spend time onthis world searching for robots.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't want to, Bliss. It seems to me that robots can't last twentythousand years without maintenance. Yet since you've seen one witha spark of activity still, it's clear I can't rely on my commonsenseguesses about robots. I mustn't lead out of ignorance. Robots may bemore enduring than I imagine, or they may have a certain capacity forself-maintenance.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Listen to me, Trevize, and please keep thisconfidential.&quot;<br />
&quot;Confidential?&quot; said Trevize, raising his voice in surprise. &quot;Fromwhom?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sh! From Pel, of course. Look, you don't have to change yourplans. You were right the first time. There are no functioning robotson this world. I detect nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;You detected that one, and one is as good as &quot;<br />
&quot;I did not detect that one. It was nonfunctioning; long nonfunctioning.&quot;<br />
&quot;You said &quot;<br />
&quot;I know what I said. Pel thought he saw motion and heard sound. Pelis a romantic. He's spent his working life gathering data, but that is adifficult way of making one's mark in the scholarly world. He would dearlylove to make an important discovery of his own. His finding of the word`Aurora' was legitimate and made him happier than you can imagine. Hewanted desperately to find more.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Are you telling me he wanted to make a discovery sobadly he convinced himself he had come upon a functioning robot whenhe hadn't?&quot;<br />
&quot;What he came upon was a lump of rust containing no more consciousnessthan the rock against which it rested.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you supported his story.&quot;<br />
&quot;I could not bring myself to rob him of his discovery. He means somuch to me.<br />
  Trevize stared at her for a full minute; then he said, &quot;Do you mindexplaining why he means so much to you? I want to know. Ireally want to know. To you he must seem an elderly man with nothingromantic about him. He's an Isolate, and you despise Isolates. You'reyoung and beautiful and there must be other parts of Gaia that havethe bodies of vigorous and handsome young men. With them you can havea physical relationship that can resonate through Gaia and bring peaksof ecstasy. So what do you an in Janov?&quot;Bliss looked at Trevize solemnly. &quot;Don't you love him?&quot;Trevize shrugged and said, &quot;I'm fond of him. I suppose you could say,in a nonsexual way, that I love him.&quot;<br />
&quot;You haven't known him very long, Trevize. Why do you love him,in that nonsexual way of yours?&quot;Trevize found himself smiling without being aware of it. &quot;He's suchan odd fellow. I honestly think that never in his life hashe given a single thought to himself. He was ordered to go along with me,and he went. No objection. He wanted me to go to Trantor, but when I saidI wanted to go to Gaia, he never argued. And now he's come along withme in this search for Earth, though he must know it's dangerous. I feelperfectly confident that if he had to sacrifice his life for me orfor anyone he would, and without repining.&quot;<br />
&quot;Would you give your life for him, Trevize?&quot;<br />
&quot;I might, if I didn't have time to think. If I did have time to think,I would hesitate and I might funk it. I'm not as good as heis. And because of that, I have this terrible urge to protect and keephim good. I don't want the Galaxy to teach him not to begood. Do you understand? And I have to protect him from you particularly. I can't bear the thought of you tossing him aside whenwhatever nonsense amuses you now is done with.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I thought you'd think something like that. Don't you supposeI see in Pel what you see in him and even more so, since I cancontact his mind directly? Do I act as though I want to hurt him? WouldI support his fantasy of having seen a functioning robot, if it weren'tthat I couldn't bear to hurt him? Trevize, I am used to what you wouldcall goodness, for every part of Gaia is ready to be sacrificed for thewhole. We know and understand no other course of action. But we give upnothing in so doing, for each part is the whole, though I don't expectyou to understand that. Pel is something different.&quot;Bliss was no longer looking at Trevize. It was as though she weretalking to herself. &quot;He is an Isolate. He is not selfless because he isa part of a greater whole. He is selfless because he is selfless. Doyou understand me? He has all to lose and nothing to gain, and yet heis what he is. He shames me for being what I am without fear of loss,when he is what he is without hope of gain.&quot;She looked up at Trevize again now, very solemnly. &quot;Do you know howmuch more I understand about him than you possibly can? And do you thinkI would harm him in any way?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Bliss, earlier today, you said, `Come, let us befriends,' and all I replied was, `If you wish.' That was grudging ofme, for I was thinking of what you might do to Janov. It is my turn,now. Come, Bliss, let us be friends. You can keep on pointing out theadvantage of Galaxia and I may keep on refusing to accept your arguments,but even so, and despite that, let us be friends.&quot; And he held outhis hand.<br />
  Of course, Trevize, she said, and their hands gripped each otherstrongly.<br />
  42Trevize grinned quietly to himself. It was an internalgrin, for the line of his mouth didn't budge.<br />
  When he had worked with the computer to find the star (if any) of thefirst set of co-ordinates, both Pelorat and Bliss had watched intentlyand had asked questions. Now they stayed in their room and slept or,at any rate, relaxed, and left the job entirely to Trevize.<br />
  In a way, it was flattering, for it seemed to Trevize that by now theyhad simply accepted the fact that Trevize knew what he was doing andrequired no supervision or encouragement. For that matter, Trevize hadgained enough experience from the first episode to rely more thoroughlyon the computer and to feel that it needed, if not none, then at leastless supervision.<br />
  Another star luminous and unrecorded on the Galactic map-showedup. This second star was more luminous than the star about which Auroracircled, and that made it all the more significant that the star wasunrecorded in the computer.<br />
  Trevize marveled at the peculiarities of ancient tradition. Wholecenturies might be telescoped or dropped out of consciousnessaltogether. Entire civilizations might be banished into forgetfulness. Yetout of the midst of these centuries, snatched from those civilizations,might be one or two factual items that would be rememberedundistorted such as these co-ordinates.<br />
  He had remarked on this to Pelorat some time before, and Pelorathad at once told him that it was precisely this that made the studyof myths and legends so rewarding. &quot;The trick is,&quot; Pelorat had said,&quot;to work out or decide which particular components of a legend representaccurate underlying truth. That isn't easy and different mythologistsare likely to pick different components, depending, usually, on whichhappen to suit their particular interpretations.&quot; .<br />
  In any case, the star was right where Deniador's co-ordinates,corrected for time, said it would be. Trevize was prepared, at thismoment, to wager a considerable sum that the third star would be inplace as well. And if it was, Trevize was prepared to suspect that thelegend was further correct in stating that there were fifty ForbiddenWorlds altogether (despite the suspiciously even number) and to wonderwhere the other forty-seven might be.<br />
  A habitable world, Forbidden World, was found circling thestar and by this time its presence didn't cause even a ripple ofsurprise in Trevize's bosom. He had been absolutely sure it would bethere. He set the Far Star into a slow orbit about it.<br />
  The cloud layer was sparse enough to allow a reasonable view of thesurface from space. The world was a watery one, as almost all habitableworlds were. There was an unbroken tropical ocean and two unbrokenpolar oceans.<br />
  In one set of middle latitudes, there was a more or less serpentinecontinent encircling the world with bays on either side producing anoccasional narrow isthmus. In the other set of middle latitudes, theland surface was broken into three large parts and each of the threewere thicker north-south than the opposite continent was.<br />
  Trevize wished he knew enough climatology to be able to predict,from what he saw, what the temperatures and seasons might be like. Fora moment, he toyed with the idea of having the computer work on theproblem. The trouble was that climate was not the point at issue.<br />
  Much more important was that, once again, the computer detected noradiation that might be of technological origin. What his telescope toldhim was that the planet was not moth-eaten and that there were no signs ofdesert. The land moved backward in various shades of green, but there wereno signs of urban areas on the dayside, no lights on the nightside.<br />
  Was this another planet filled with every kind of life but human?<br />
  He rapped at the door of the other bedroom.<br />
  Bliss? he called out in a loud whisper, and rapped again.<br />
  There was a rustling, and Bliss's voice said, &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Could you come out here? I need your help &quot;<br />
&quot;If you wait just a bit, I'll make myself a bit presentable.&quot;When she finally appeared, she looked as presentable as Trevize hadever seen her. He felt a twinge of annoyance at having been made to wait,however, for it made little difference to him what she looked like. Butthey were friends now, and he suppressed the annoyance.<br />
  She said with a smile and in a perfectly pleasant tone, &quot;What can Ido for you, Trevize?&quot;Trevize waved at the viewscreen. &quot;As you can see, we're passing overthe surface of what looks like a perfectly healthy world with a quitesolid vegetation cover over its land area. No lights at night, however,and no technological radiation. Please listen and tell me if there's anyanimal life. There was one point at which I thought I could see herdsof grazing animals, but I wasn't sure. It might be a case of seeing whatone desperately wants to see.&quot;Bliss &quot;listened.&quot; At least, a curiously intent look came across herface. She said, &quot;Oh yes rich in animal life.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mammalian?&quot;<br />
&quot;Must be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Human?&quot;Now she seemed to concentrate harder. A full minute passed, andthen another, and finally she relaxed. &quot;I can't quite tell. Every oncein a while it seemed to me that I detected a whiff of intelligencesufficiently intense to be considered human. But it was so feeble andso occasional that perhaps I, too, was only sensing what I desperatelywanted to sense. You see &quot;She paused in thought, and Trevize nudged her with a &quot;Well?&quot;She said, &quot;The thing is I seem to detect something else. It is notsomething I'm familiar with, but I don't see how it can be anythingbut &quot;Her face tightened again as she began to &quot;listen&quot; with still greaterintensity.<br />
  Well? said Trevize again.<br />
  She relaxed. &quot;I don't see how it can be anything but robots.&quot;<br />
&quot;Robots!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, and if I detect them, surely I ought to be able to detect humanbeings, too. But I don't.&quot;<br />
&quot;Robots!&quot; said Trevize again, frowning.<br />
  Yes, said Bliss, &quot;and I should judge, in great numbers.&quot;43Pelorat also said &quot;Robots!&quot; in almost exactly Trevize'stone when he was told of them. Then he smiled slightly. &quot;You were right,Golan, and I was wrong to doubt you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't remember your doubting me, Janov.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh well, old man, I didn't think I ought to express it. I justthought, in my heart, that it was a mistake to leave Aurora while therewas a chance we might interview some surviving robot. But then it'sclear you knew there would be a richer supply of robots here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all, Janov. I didn't know . I merely chancedit. Bliss tells me their mental fields seem to imply they are fullyfunctioning, and it seems to me they can't very well be fully functioningwithout human beings about for care and maintenance. However, she can'tspot anything human so we're still looking.&quot;Pelorat studied the viewscreen thoughtfully. &quot;It seems to be allforest, doesn't it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mostly forest. But there are clear patches that may be grasslands. Thething is that I see no cities, or any lights at night, or anything butthermal radiation at any time.&quot;<br />
&quot;So no human beings after all?&quot;<br />
&quot;I wonder. Bliss is in the galley trying to concentrate. I've setup an arbitrary prime meridian for the planet which means that it'sdivided into latitude and longitude in the computer. Bliss has a littledevice which she presses whenever she encounters what seems an unusualconcentration of robotic mental activity I suppose you can't say`neuronic activity' in connection with robots or any whiff ofhuman thought. The device is linked to the computer, which thus getsa fix on all the latitudes and longitudes, and we'll let it make thechoice among them and pick a good place for landing.&quot;Pelorat looked uneasy. &quot;Is it wise to leave the matter of choice tothe computer?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why not, Janov? It's a very competent computer. Besides, when youhave no basis on which to make a choice yourself, where's the harm inat least considering the computer's choice?&quot;Pelorat brightened up. &quot;There's something to that, Golan. Some of theoldest legends include tales of people making choices by tossing cubesto the ground.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? What does that accomplish?&quot;<br />
&quot;Each face of the cube has some decision onit yes no perhaps postpone and soon. Whichever face happens to come upward on landing would be taken asbearing the advice to be followed. Or they would set a ball rolling abouta slotted disc with different decisions scattered among the slots. Thedecision written on the slot in which the ball ends is to be taken. Somemythologists think such activities represented games of chance ratherthan lotteries, but the two are much the same thing in my opinion.&quot;<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;we're playing a game of chance in choosingour place of landing.&quot;Bliss emerged from the galley in time to hear the last comment. Shesaid, &quot;No game of chance. I pressed several `maybes' and then onesure-fire `yes,' and it's to the `yes' that we'll be going.&quot;<br />
&quot;What made it a `yes'?&quot; asked Trevize.<br />
  I caught a whiff of human thought. Definite. Unmistakable.44It had been raining, for the grass was wet. Overhead,the clouds were scudding by and showing signs of breaking up.<br />
  The Far Star had come to a gentle rest near a small grove oftrees. (In case of wild dogs, Trevize thought, only partly in jest.) Allabout was what looked like pasture land, and coming down from the greaterheight at which a better and wider view had been possible, Trevize hadseen what looked like orchards and grain fields and this time,an unmistakable view of grazing animals.<br />
  There were no structures, however. Nothing artificial, except thatthe regularity of the trees in the orchard and the sharp boundaries thatseparated fields were themselves as artificial as a microwave-receivingpower station would have been.<br />
  Could that level of artificiality have been produced by robots,however? Without human beings?<br />
  Quietly, Trevize was putting on his holsters. This time, he knew thatboth weapons were in working order and that both were fully charged. Fora moment, he caught Bliss's eye and paused.<br />
  She said, &quot;Go ahead. I don't think you'll have any use for them,but I thought as much once before, didn't I?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;Would you like to be armed, Janov?&quot;Pelorat shuddered. &quot;No, thank you. Between you and your physicaldefense, and Bliss and her mental defense, I feel in no danger at all. Isuppose it is cowardly of me to hide in your protective shadows, butI can't feel proper shame when I'm too busy feeling grateful that Ineedn't be in a position of possibly having to use force.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I understand. Just don't go anywhere alone. If Blissand I separate, you stay with one of us and don't dash off somewhereunder the spur of a private curiosity.&quot;<br />
&quot;You needn't worry, Trevize,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;I'll see to that.&quot;Trevize stepped out of the ship first. The wind was brisk and justa trifle cool in the aftermath of the rain, but Trevize found thatwelcome. It had probably been uncomfortably warm and humid before therain.<br />
  He took in his breath with surprise. The smell of the planet wasdelightful. Every planet had its own odor, he knew, an odor always strangeand usually distasteful perhaps only because it was strange. Mightnot strange be pleasant as well? Or was this the accident of catching theplanet just after the rain at a particular season of the year. Whicheverit was &quot;Come on,&quot; he called. &quot;It's quite pleasant out here.&quot;Pelorat emerged and said, &quot;Pleasant is definitely the word for it. Doyou suppose it always smells like this?&quot;<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter. Within the hour, we'll be accustomed to the aroma,and our nasal receptors will be sufficiently saturated, for us to smellnothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pity,&quot; said Pelorat.<br />
  The grass is wet, said Bliss, with a shade of disapproval.<br />
  Why not? After all, it rains on Gaia, too! said Trevize, and as hesaid that a shaft of yellow sunlight reached them momentarily througha small break in the clouds. There would soon be more of it.<br />
  Yes, said Bliss, &quot;but we know when and we're prepared for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Too bad,&quot; said Trevize; &quot;you lose the thrill of the unexpected.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;You're right. I'll try not to be provincial.&quot;Pelorat looked about and said, in a disappointed tone, &quot;There seemsto be nothing about.&quot;<br />
&quot;Only seems to be,&quot; said Bliss. &quot;They're approaching from beyondthat rise.&quot; She looked toward Trevize. &quot;Do you think we ought to go tomeet them?&quot;Trevize shook his head. &quot;No. We've come to meet them across manyparsecs. Let them walk the rest of the way. We'll wait for them here.&quot;Only Bliss could sense the approach until, from the direction of herpointing finger, a figure appeared over the brow of the rise. Then asecond, and a third.<br />
  I believe that is all at the moment, said Bliss.<br />
  Trevize watched curiously. Though he had never seen robots, therewas not a particle of doubt in him that that was what they were. Theyhad the schematic and impressionistic shape of human beings and yet werenot obviously metallic in appearance. The robotic surface was dull andgave the illusion of softness, as though it were covered in plush.<br />
  But how did he know the softness was an illusion? Trevize felt a suddendesire to feel those figures who were approaching so stolidly. If it weretrue that this was a Forbidden World and that spaceships never approachedit and surely that must be so since the sun was not includedin the Galactic map then the Far Star and the people itcarried must represent something the robots had never experienced. Yetthey were reacting with steady certainty, as though they were workingtheir way through a routine exercise.<br />
  Trevize said, in a low voice, &quot;Here we may have information we canget nowhere else in the Galaxy. We could ask them for the location ofEarth with reference to this world, and if they know, they will tellus. Who knows how long these things have functioned and endured? Theymay answer out of personal memory. Think of that.&quot;<br />
&quot;On the other hand,&quot; said Bliss, &quot;they may be recently manufacturedand may know nothing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Or,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;they may know, but may refuse to tell us.&quot;Trevize said, &quot;I suspect they can't refuse unless they've been orderednot to tell us, and why should such orders be issued when surely no oneon this planet could have expected our coming?&quot;At a distance of about three meters, the robots stopped. They saidnothing and made no further movement.<br />
  Trevize, his hand on his blaster, said to Bliss, without taking hiseyes from the robot, &quot;Can you tell whether they are hostile?&quot;<br />
&quot;You'll have to allow for the fact that I have no experience whatsoeverwith their mental workings, Trevize, but I don't detect anything thatseems hostile.&quot;Trevize took his right hand away from the butt of the weapon, butkept it near. He raised his left hand, palm toward the robots, in what hehoped would be recognized as a gesture of peace and said, speaking slowly,&quot;I greet you. We come to this world as friends.&quot;The central robot of the three ducked his head in a kind of abortivebow that might also have been taken as a gesture of peace by an optimist,and replied.<br />
  Trevize's jaw dropped in astonishment. In a world of Galacticcommunication, one did not think of failure in so fundamental aneed. However, the robot did not speak in Galactic Standard or anythingapproaching it. In fact, Trevize could not understand a word.<br />
  45Pelorat's surprise was as great as that of Trevize,but there was an obvious element of pleasure in it, too.<br />
  Isn't that strange? he said.<br />
  Trevize turned to him and said, with more than a touch of asperityin his voice, &quot;It's not strange. It's gibberish.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;Not gibberish at all. It's Galactic, but very archaic. Icatch a few words. I could probably understand it easily if it werewritten down. It's the pronunciation that's the real puzzle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, what did it say?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think it told you it didn't understand what you said.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;I can't tell what it said, but what I sense ispuzzlement, which fits. That is, if I can trust my analysis of roboticemotion or if there is such a thing as robotic emotion.&quot;Speaking very slowly, and with difficulty, Pelorat said something,and the three robots ducked their head in unison.<br />
  What was that? said Trevize.<br />
  Pelorat said, &quot;I said I couldn't speak well, but I would try. I askedfor a little time. Dear me, old chap, this is fearfully interesting.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fearfully disappointing,&quot; muttered Trevize.<br />
  You see, said Pelorat, &quot;every habitable planet in the Galaxy managesto work out its own variety of Galactic so that there are a milliondialects that are sometimes barely intercomprehensible, but they're allpulled together by the development of Galactic Standard. Assuming thisworld to have been isolated for twenty thousand years, the language wouldordinarily drift so far from that of the rest of the Galaxy as to be anentirely different language. That it isn't may be because the world hasa social system that depends upon robots which can only understand thelanguage as spoken in the fashion in which they were programmed. Ratherthan keep reprogramming, the language remained static and we now havewhat is to us merely a very archaic form of Galactic.&quot;<br />
&quot;There's an example,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;of how a robotized society canbe held static and made, to turn degenerate.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, my dear fellow,&quot; protested Pelorat, &quot;keeping a languagerelatively unchanged is not necessarily a sign of degeneration. There areadvantages to it. Documents preserved for centuries and millennia retaintheir meaning and give greater longevity and authority to historicalrecords. In the rest of the Galaxy, the language of Imperial edicts ofthe time of Hari Seldon already begins to sound quaint.&quot;<br />
&quot;And do you know this archaic Galactic?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not to say know , Golan. It's just that in studyingancient myths and legends I've picked up the trick of it. The vocabularyis not entirely different, but it is inflected differently, and thereare idiomatic expressions we don't use any longer and, as I have said,the pronunciation is totally changed. I can act as interpreter, but notas a very good one.&quot;Trevize heaved a tremulous sigh. &quot;A small stroke of good fortune isbetter than none. Carry on, Janov.&quot;Pelorat turned to the robots, waited a moment, then looked back atTrevize. &quot;What am I supposed to say?&quot;<br />
&quot;Let's go all the way. Ask them where Earth is.&quot;Pelorat said the words one at a time, with exaggerated gestures ofhis hands.<br />
  The robots looked at each other and made a few sounds. The middleone then spoke to Pelorat, who replied while moving his hands apart asthough he were stretching a length of rubber. The robot responded byspacing his words as carefully as Pelorat had.<br />
  Pelorat said to Trevize, &quot;I'm not sure I'm getting across what I meanby `Earth.' I suspect they think I'm referring to some region on theirplanet and they say they don't know of any such region.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do they use the name of this planet, Janov?&quot;<br />
&quot;The closest I can come to what I think they are using as the name is`Solaria.'&quot;<br />
&quot;Have you ever heard of it in your legends?&quot;<br />
&quot;No any more than I had ever heard of Aurora.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, ask them if there is any place named Earth in thesky among the stars. Point upward.&quot;Again an exchange, and finally Pelorat turned and said, &quot;All I canget from them, Golan, is that there are no places in the sky.&quot;Bliss said, &quot;Ask those robots how old they are; or rather, how longthey have been functioning.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know how to say `functioning,'&quot; said Pelorat, shaking hishead. In fact, I'm not sure if I can say `how old.' I'm not a very good interpreter.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do the best you can, Pel dear,&quot; said Bliss.<br />
  And after several exchanges, Pelorat said, &quot;They've been functioningfor twenty-six years.&quot;<br />
&quot;Twenty-six years,&quot; muttered Trevize in disgust. &quot;They're hardlyolder than you are, Bliss.&quot;Bliss said, with sudden pride, &quot;It so happens &quot;<br />
&quot;I know. You're Gaia, which is thousands of years old. In anycase, these robots cannot talk about Earth from personal experience,and their memory-banks clearly do not include anything not necessary totheir functioning. So they know nothing about astronomy.&quot;Pelorat said, &quot;There may be other robots somewhere on the planet thatare primordial, perhaps.&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt it,&quot; said Trevize, &quot;but ask them, if you can find the wordsfor it, Janov.&quot;This time there was quite a long conversation and Pelorat eventuallybroke it off with a flushed face and a clear air of frustration.<br />
  Golan, he said, &quot;I don't understand part of what they're trying tosay, but I gather that the older robots are used for manual labor anddon't know anything. If this robot were a human, I'd say he spoke ofthe older robots with contempt. These three are house robots, they say,and are not allowed to grow old before being replaced. They're the oneswho really know things their words, not mine.&quot;<br />
&quot;They don't know much,&quot; growled Trevize. &quot;At least of the things wewant to know.&quot;<br />
&quot;I now regret,&quot; said Pelorat, &quot;that we left Aurora so hurriedly. Ifwe had found a robot survivor there, and we surely would have, sincethe very first one I encountered still had a spark of life left in it,they would know of Earth through personal memory.&quot;<br />
&quot;Provided their memories were intact, Janov,&quot; said Trevize. &quot;Wecan always go back there and, if we have to, dog packs or not, wewill. But if these robots are only a couple of decades old,there must be those who manufacture them, and the manufacturers must behuman, I should think.&quot; He turned to Bliss. &quot;Are you sure you sensed &quot;But she raised a hand to stop him and there was a strained and intentlook on her face. &quot;Coming now,&quot; she said, in a low voice.<br />
  Trevize turned his face toward the rise and there, first appearingfrom behind it, and then striding toward them, was the unmistakablefigure of a human being. His complexion was pale and his hair light andlong, standing out slightly from the sides of his head. His face wasgrave but quite young in appearance. His bare arms and legs were notparticularly muscled.<br />
  The robots stepped aside for him, and he advanced till he stood intheir midst.<br />
  He then spoke in a clear, pleasant voice and his words, although usedarchaically, were in Galactic Standard, and easily understood.<br />
  Greetings, wanderers from space, he said. &quot;What would you withmy robots?&quot;46Trevize did not cover himself with glory. He saidfoolishly, &quot;You speak Galactic?&quot;The Solarian said, with a grim smile, &quot;And why not, since I am notmute?&quot;<br />
&quot;But these?&quot; Trevize gestured toward the robots.<br />
  These are robots. They speak our language, as I do. But I amSolarian and hear the hyperspatial communications of the worlds beyondso that I have learned your way of speaking, as have my predecessors. Mypredecessors have left descriptions of the language, but I constantlyhear new words and expressions that change with the years, as though youSettlers can settle worlds, but not words. How is it you are surprisedat my understanding of your language?&quot;I should not have been, said Trevize. &quot;I apologize. It was justthat speaking to the robots, I had not thought to hear Galactic onthis world.&quot;He studied the Solarian. He was wearing a thin white robe, drapedloosely over his shoulder, with large openings for his arms. It was openin front, exposing a bare chest and loincloth below. Except for a pairof light sandals, he wore nothing else.<br />
  It occurred to Trevize that he could not tell whether the Solarianwas male or female. The breasts were male certainly but the chest washairless and the thin loincloth showed no bulge of any kind.<br />
  He turned to Bliss and said in a low voice, &quot;This might still be arobot, but very like a human being in &quot;Bliss said, her lips hardly moving, &quot;The mind is that of a human being,not a robot.&quot;The Solarian said, &quot;Yet you have not answered my original question. Ishall excuse the failure and put it down to your surprise. I now ask againand you must not fail a second time. What would you with my robots?&quot;Trevize said, &quot;We are travelers who seek information to reach ourdestination. We asked your robots for information that would help us,but they lacked the knowledge.&quot;<br />
&quot;What is the information you seek? Perhaps I can help you.&quot;<br />
&quot;We seek the location of Earth. Could you tell us that?&quot;The Solarian's eyebrows lifted. &quot;I would have thought that yourfirst object of curiosity would have been myself. I will supply thatinformation although you have not asked for it. I am Sarton Bander andyou stand upon the Bander estate, which stretches as far as your eye cansee in every direction and far beyond. I cannot say that you are welcomehere, for in coming here, you have violated a trust. You are the firstSettlers to touch down upon Solaria in many thousands of years and, asit turns out, you have come here merely to inquire as to the best wayof reaching another world. In the old days, Settlers, you and your shipwould have been destroyed on sight.&quot;<br />
&quot;That would be a barbaric way of treating people who mean no harmand offer none,&quot; said Trevize cautiously.<br />
  I agree, but when members of an expanding society set foot upon aninoffensive and static one, that mere touch is filled with potentialharm. While we feared that harm, we were ready to destroy those who cameat the instant of their coming. Since we no longer have reason to fear,we are, as you see, ready to talk.Trevize said, &quot;I appreciate the information you have offered us sofreely, and yet you failed to answer the question I did ask. I willrepeat it. Could you tell us the location of the planet Earth?&quot;<br />
&quot;By Earth, I take it you mean the world on which the human species,and the various species of plants and animals&quot; his hand movedgracefully about as though to indicate all the surroundings aboutthem &quot;originated.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I do, sir.&quot;A queer look of repugnance flitted over the Solarian's face. He said,&quot;Please address me simply as Bander, if you must use a form of address. Donot address me by any word that includes a sign of gender. I am neithermale nor female. I am whole .&quot;Trevize nodded (he had been right). &quot;As you wish, Bander. What, then,is the location of Earth, the world of origin of all of us?&quot;Bander said, &quot;I do not know. Nor do I wish to know. If I did know,or if I could find out, it would do you no good, for Earth no longerexists as a world. Ah,&quot; he went on, stretching out his arms. &quot;Thesun feels good. I am not often on the surface, and never when the sun doesnot show itself. My robots were sent to greet you while the sun was yethiding behind the clouds. I followed only when the clouds cleared.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why is it that Earth no longer exists as a world?&quot; said Trevizeinsistently, steeling himself for the tale of radioactivity onceagain.<br />
  Bander, however, ignored the question or, rather, put it to one sidecarelessly. &quot;The story is too long,&quot; he said. &quot;You told me that you camewith no intent of harm.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is correct.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why then did you come armed?&quot;<br />
&quot;That is merely a precaution. I did not know what I might meet.&quot;<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter. Your little weapons represent no danger tome. Yet I am curious. I have, of course, heard much of your arms, andof your curiously barbaric history that seems to depend so entirely uponarms. Even so, I have never actually seen a weapon. May I see yours?&quot;Trevize took a step backward. &quot;I'm afraid not, Bander.&quot;Bander seemed amused. &quot;I asked only out of politeness. I need nothave asked at all.&quot;It held out its hand and from Trevize's right holster, there emergedhis blaster, while from his left holster, there rose up his neuronicwhip. Trevize snatched at his weapons but felt his arms held back asthough by stiffly elastic bonds. Both Pelorat and Bliss started forwardand it was clear that they were held as well.<br />
  Bander said, &quot;Don't bother trying to interfere. You cannot.&quot; Theweapons flew to its hands and it looked them over carefully. &quot;This one,&quot;it said, indicating the blaster, &quot;seems to be a microwave beamer thatproduces heat, thus exploding any fluid-containing body. The other ismore subtle, and, I must confess, I do not see at a glance what it isintended to do. However, since you mean no harm and offer no harm, youdon't need arms. I can, and I do, bleed the energy content of the unitsof each weapon. That leaves them harmless unless you use one or the otheras a club, and they would be clumsy indeed if used for that purpose.&quot;The Solarian released the weapons and again they drifted throughthe air, this time back toward Trevize. Each settled neatly into itsholster.<br />
  Trevize, feeling himself released, pulled out his blaster, but therewas no need to use it. The contact hung loosely, and the energy unithad clearly been totally drained. That was precisely the case with theneuronic whip as well.<br />
  He looked up at Bander, who said, smiling, &quot;You are quite helpless,Outworlder. I can as easily, if I so desired, destroy your ship and,of course, you.&quot;</p>
