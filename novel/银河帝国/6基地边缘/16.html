<div class='layout'><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN CONVERGENCE</p><p>第16章 焦点</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>WHEN STOR GENDIBAL FINALLY MADE OUT COMPOR’S SHIP ON HIS viewscreen, it seemed like the end of an incredibly long journey. Yet, of course, it was not the end, but merely the beginning. The journey from Trantor to Sayshell had been nothing but prologue.</p><p>当史陀·坚迪柏终于从显像屏幕上发现康普的太空艇时，似乎代表他已经抵达终点，这趟漫长到难以想象的旅程总算结束了。但这当然不是什么终点，而是真正的起点。从川陀到赛协尔的漫长旅途，只能算是一场序幕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi looked awed. “Is that another ship of space, Master?”</p><p>诺微现出敬畏的神色。“师傅，那是另一艘太空之船吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Spaceship, Novi. It is. It’s the one we have been striving to reach. It is a larger ship than this one--and a better one. It can move through space so quickly that if it fled from us, this ship could not possibly catch it--or even follow it.”</p><p>“应该说太空船，诺微。没错，它就是我们拼命赶来会合的那一艘。它比我们的太空船更大，而且更为精良。它能以无法想象的高速掠过太空，如果它要逃避，我们这艘太空船不可能追得上，甚至无法跟在它后面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Faster than a ship of the masters?” Sura Novi seemed appalled by the thought.</p><p>“比师傅们的太空船还快？”苏拉·诺微似乎吓呆了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal shrugged. “I may be, as you say, a master, but I am not a master in all things. We scholars do not have ships like these, nor do we have many of the material devices that the owners of those ships have.”</p><p>坚迪柏耸了耸肩。“或许我可以算你的师傅，但我并非样样精通。我们学者并没有那样的太空船，也不像那些太空船的主人，拥有那么多的科技设备。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But how can scholars lack such things, Master?”</p><p>“可是学者怎么可能没有这些东西呢，师傅？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Because we are masters in what is important. The material advances that these others have are trifles.”</p><p>“因为我们主宰着真正重要的事物。那些人所拥有的物质文明，只是微不足道的东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi’s brows bent together in thought. “It seems to me that to go so quickly that a master cannot follow is no trifle. Who are these people who are wonder-having--who have such things?”</p><p>诺微皱着眉头沉思了一阵子。“我认为能够飞得那么快，快得连师傅都没法追得上，并不是微不足道的事。他们到底是什么人，能够拥有这些奇迹——我是说，拥有这些东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal was amused. “They call themselves the Foundation. Have you ever heard of the Foundation?”</p><p>坚迪柏被她逗乐了。“他们自称为基地人，你听说过基地吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(He caught himself wondering what the Hamish knew or did not know of the Galaxy and why it never occurred to the Speakers to wonder about such things. --Or was it only he who had never wondered about such things--only he who assumed that the Hamish cared for nothing more than grubbing in the soil.)</p><p>他发觉自己突然起了好奇心，想知道阿姆人对银河究竟了解多少，更想知道发言者为何都对这个问题从不好奇。或者，是不是只有他自己从未感到好奇；只有他才以为阿姆人除了喜欢挖土，其他事情一概不闻不问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi shook her head thoughtfully. “I have never heard of it, Master. When the schoolmaster taught me letter-lore--how to read, I mean--he told me there were many other worlds and told me the names of some. He said our Hamish world had the proper name of Trantor and that it once ruled all the worlds. He said Trantor was covered with gleaming iron and had an Emperor who was an allmaster.”</p><p>诺微一面回想一面摇头。“师傅，我从来没有听说过。当学校师傅教我文字学——我的意思是读书写字的时候，他告诉我还有很多其他的世界，还告诉我一些世界的名字。他说，我们的阿姆世界有个正式名字叫川陀，它曾经统治过所有的世界。他又说川陀以前包着闪闪发光的铁，上面住着一个皇帝，他是人人的主人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her eyes looked up at Gendibal with a shy merriment. “I unbelieve most of it, though. There are many stories the wordspinners tell in the meeting-halls in the time of longer nights. When I was a small girl, I believed them all, but as I grew older, I found that many of them were not true. I believe very few now; perhaps none. Even schoolmasters tell unbelievables.”</p><p>她抬起头来望着坚迪柏，目光流露出略带羞赧的喜悦。“不过，我勿相信其中的大部分。在晚上比白天长很多的日子里，我们聚在集会厅中，说书的人就会讲很多故事。当我是个小女孩的时候，我相信它们全部，但是当我渐渐长大，我发现它们许多都不是真的。现在我只相信非常少，也许全都勿相信。就连学校里的师傅，也会说些难以置信的故事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Just the same, Novi, that particular story of the schoolmaster is true--but it was long ago. Trantor was indeed covered by metal and had indeed an Emperor who ruled all the Galaxy. Now, however, it is the people of the Foundation who will someday rule all the worlds. They grow stronger all the time.”</p><p>“不过，诺微，学校师傅讲的这个故事是真的，但那是很久以前的事。川陀的确曾经被金属覆盖，也的确有个统治全银河的皇帝。然而，如今一切都变了，基地人总有一天会统治所有的世界，他们的力量不断在茁壮。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“They will ruleall , Master?”</p><p>“他们会统治所有的世界吗，师傅？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Not immediately. In five hundred years.”</p><p>“不会立刻实现，还要再过五百年。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And they will master the masters as well?”</p><p>“然后他们也会变成所有师傅的主人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“No, no. They will rule the worlds. We will rulethem --for their safety and the safety of all the worlds.”</p><p>“不，不。他们将统治所有的世界，而我们将统治他们。这是为了他们的安全，以及所有世界的安全。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi was frowning again. She said, “Master, do these people of the Foundation have many of these remarkable ships?”</p><p>诺微又皱起了眉头，她说：“师傅，这些基地人，是不是有许多这么好的太空船？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I imagine so, Novi.”</p><p>“我想是吧，诺微。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And other things that are very--astonishing?”</p><p>“他们还有其他非常……惊人的东西？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“They have powerful weapons of all kinds.”</p><p>“他们拥有各式各样威力强大的武器。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Then, Master, can they not take all the worlds now?”</p><p>“那么，师傅，他们不能现在就收服所有的世界吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“No, they cannot. It is not yet time.”</p><p>“他们不能那样做，时机尚未成熟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But why can they not? Would the masters stop them?”</p><p>“可是为什么呢？是不是师傅们会阻止他们？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“We wouldn’t have to, Novi. Even if we did nothing, they could not take all the worlds.”</p><p>“我们不需要那么做，诺微。即使我们撒手不管，他们也无法收服所有的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But what would stop them?”</p><p>“到底是什么会阻止他们呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You see,” began Gendibal, “there is a plan that a wise man once devised--”</p><p>“是这样的，”坚迪柏开始解释，“从前有个智者，设计出一套计划……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He stopped, smiled slightly, and shook his head. “It is hard to explain, Novi. Another time, perhaps. In fact, when you see what will happen before we ever see Trantor again, you may even understand without my explaining.”</p><p>他突然住口，淡淡一笑，同时摇了摇头。“这实在很难解释，诺微，或许改天再说吧。事实上，在我们回川陀之前，你的所见所闻也许就能使你了解这一切，用不着我再多作解释。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“What will happen, Master?”</p><p>“会发生什么事呢，师傅？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I am not sure, Novi. But all will happen well.”</p><p>“我还不确定，诺微，不过一切都会很顺利的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He turned away and prepared to make contact with Compor. And, as he did so, he could not quite keep an inner thought from saying: At least I hope so.</p><p>他转过身去，准备跟康普进行联络。与此同时，他忍不住在心中自言自语了一句：至少我希望如此。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was instantly angry with himself, for he knew the source of that foolish and weakening drift of thought. It was the picture of the elaborate and enormous Foundation might in the shape of Compor’s ship and it was his chagrin at Novi’s open admiration of it.</p><p>他马上对自己发起脾气来，因为这个愚蠢而犹疑的念头究竟源自何处，他自己再清楚不过。透过康普的太空艇，他看到了基地的精实壮大，而诺微对它毫不掩饰的赞叹，更是令他恼火不已。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Stupid! How could he let himself compare the possession of mere strength and power with the possession of the ability to guide events? It was what generations of Speakers had called “the fallacy of the hand at the throat.”</p><p>真笨！自己怎会将有形力量与无形的控制力相提并论？这就是历代发言者所谓的“扼住咽喉的谬误”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To think that he was not yet immune to its allures</p><p>自己对那种诱惑竟然还没有免疫力，真是难以想象。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Munn Li Compor was not in the least sure as to how he ought to comport himself. For most of his life, he had had the vision of all-powerful Speakers existing just beyond his circle of experience-- Speakers, with whom he was occasionally in contact and who had, in their mysterious grip, the whole of humanity.</p><p>曼恩·李·康普完全不知道等会儿该如何应对。那些偶尔与他接触的发言者，始终以神秘的方式掌握着全体人类的命运，然而在他一生之中，全能的发言者从未在他面前出现过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Of them all, it had been Stor Gendibal to whom, in recent years, he had turned for direction. It was not even a voice he had encountered most times, but a mere presence in his mind--hyperspeech without a hyper-relay.</p><p>最近几年，在诸位发言者中，史陀·坚迪柏成了他的顶头上司。不但坚迪柏的声音是他最常听到的，坚迪柏的容貌也经常出现在他心中，那是一种无需超波中继器的超波通讯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In this respect, the Second Foundation had gone far beyond the Foundation. Without material device, but just by the educated and advanced power of the mind alone, they could reach across the par. sees in a manner that could not be tapped, could not be infringed upon. It was an invisible, indetectable network that held all the worlds fast through the mediation of a relatively few dedicated individuals.</p><p>就这方面而言，第二基地的成就远远超越第一基地。他们舍弃任何有形的设备，仅靠训练有素的心灵所发出的能量，便能和许多秒差距之外取得联络，而且绝对不会遭到窃听或蓄意干扰。这是一种隐形且无法侦测的通讯网路，仅仅借着少数专职人员居中协调，就能在各个世界间建立起迅速的联系。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor had, more than once, experienced a kind of uplifting at the thought of his role. How small the band of which he was one; how enormous an influence they exerted. --And how secret it all was. Even his wife knew nothing of his hidden life.</p><p>当康普想到自己的角色时，曾经不只一次生出飘飘然的感觉。他所属的这个团体何其微小，发挥的影响力却何其巨大，而这一切又是何其机密，连妻子都不知道他的这重身份。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And it was the Speakers who held the strings--and this one Speaker, this Gendibal, who might (Compor thought) be the next First Speaker, the more-than-Emperor of a more-than-Empire.</p><p>一切都由诸位发言者在幕后操纵，而这位发言者，这位坚迪柏，（康普想）很可能会成为下一代的第一发言者，在比帝国更伟大的国度中，扮演比皇帝更有权势的角色。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now Gendibal was here, in a ship of Trantor, and Compor fought to stifle his disappointment at not having such a meeting take place on Trantor itself.</p><p>如今坚迪柏终于抵达此地，就在对面那艘川陀太空船中。这次会面无法在川陀举行，令康普感到失望，但他尽力压制住这个情绪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Couldthat be a ship of Trantor? Any of the early Traders who had carried the Foundation’s wares through a hostile Galaxy would have had a better ship than that. No wonder it had taken the Speaker so long to cover the distance from Trantor to Sayshell.</p><p>那玩意儿会是川陀的太空船吗？想当年，带着基地制品闯荡险恶银河的行商，他们的太空商船都要比这艘好些。怪不得从川陀赶到赛协尔，会浪费发言者那么多的时间。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not even equipped with a unidock mechanism that would have welded the two ships into one when the crosstransfer of personnel was desired. Even the contemptible Sayshellian fleet was equipped with it. Instead, the Speaker had to match velocities and then cast a tether across the gap and swing along it, as in Imperial days.</p><p>现代船舰一律具有“自动对接机制”，能将两艘船舰紧密接驳，让双方人员可以互相通行。就连低劣的赛协尔舰队，也都拥有这种配备。可是，这位发言者却得像帝国时代那样，首先调整太空船的速度，然后向康普的太空艇抛出一条索链，再顺着索链从太空中摆荡过来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was it, thought Compor gloomily, unable to repress the feeling. The ship was no more than an old-fashioned Imperial vessel-- and a small one at that.</p><p>是这艘太空船没错，康普很是沮丧，无法压抑失望的情绪。它根本就是一艘帝国的旧式太空船，甚至还是小型的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Two figures were moving across the tether--one of them so clumsily that it was clear it had never attempted to maneuver through space before.</p><p>此时，有两个人顺着索链缓缓移过来。其中之一动作极为笨拙，一看就知道并没有太空漫步的经验。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Finally they were on board and removed their space suits. Speaker Stor Gendibal was of moderate height and of unimpressive appearance; he was not large and powerful, nor did he exude an air of learning. His dark, deep-set eyes were the only indication of his wisdom. But now the Speaker looked about with a clear indication of being in awehimself .</p><p>最后，他们总算登上康普的太空艇，除下了太空衣。史陀·坚迪柏发言者身材中等，相貌并不出众；他没有威风凛凛的架势，也并未散发任何学者的气质，只有那对深陷的黑眼珠，显现出几丝智慧的光芒。可是现在，这位发言者忙着四下张望，明显地流露出敬畏的神色。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other was a woman as tall as Gendibal, plain in appearance. Her mouth was open in astonishment as she looked about</p><p>另一个人则是个和坚迪柏差不多高的女子，外表平庸的她不停东张西望，惊讶得嘴巴都合不拢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Moving across the tether had not been an entirely unpleasant experience for Gendibal. He was not a spaceman--no Second Foundationer was--but neither was he a complete surface worm, for no Second Foundationer was allowed to be that. The possible need for space flight was, after all, always looming above them, though every Second Foundationer hoped the need would arise only infrequently. (Preem Palver--the extent of whose space travels was legendary-- had once said, ruefully, that the measure of the success of a Speaker was the fewness of the times he was compelled to move through space in order to assure the success of the Plan.)</p><p>对坚迪柏而言，太空漫步并非全然不愉快的经验。他当然不是太空人，第二基地分子都不是，但他也并非真正的“地虎”，因为凡是第二基地分子，都必须接受太空人的训练。毕竟，他们随时可能需要进行太空飞行。不过第二基地分子全部抱持相同的想法，都希望这种需要愈少愈好。（普芮姆·帕佛所做的众多太空旅行，如今已经成为传奇。他曾经语重心长地说过一句话：为了确保谢顿计划顺利执行，发言者有时不得不闯荡太空，但是愈成功的发言者，被迫飞上太空的次数就愈少。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal had had to use a tether three times before. This was his fourth use and even if he had felt tension over the matter, it would have disappeared in his concern for Sura Novi. He needed no mentalics to see that stepping into nothingness had totally upset her.</p><p>过去，坚迪柏曾有三次不得不使用索链的经验，今天是他第四次使用这种装置。由于他十分担心苏拉·诺微，自己反倒没有紧张的感觉。置身虚空的想法吓得她不知所措，他不需要依靠任何精神力量，就能清楚看出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I be afeared, Master,” she said when he explained what would have to be done. “It be naughtness into which I will make footstep.” If nothing else, her sudden descent into thick Hamish dialect showed the extent of her disturbance.</p><p>“我真系很惊吓，师傅。”当他向她解释该怎么做的时候，她这么回答。“我将在虚无中走脚步。”别的不说，她突然又吐出道地的阿姆方言，就足以显示她多么惊慌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said gently, “I cannot leave you on board this ship, Novi, for I will be going into the other and I must have you with me. There is no danger, for your space suit will protect you from all harm and there is no place for you to fall to. Even if you lose your grip on the tether, you will remain nearly where you are and I will be within arm’s reach so that I can gather you in. Come, Novi, show me that you are brave enough--as well as bright enough--to become a scholar.”</p><p>坚迪柏柔声对她说：“我不能把你留在这艘船上，诺微。我自己要到另一艘上面去，所以你必须跟我一道走。绝对不会有什么危险，太空衣能保护你不受任何伤害，而且你根本不会掉到什么地方去。即使没有抓牢索链，你也几乎只会留在原处，而我会一直和你保持一臂之遥，随时可以抓你一把。来吧，诺微，向我证明你有足够的胆量，又有足够的聪明，一定能够成为一名学者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She made no further objection and Gendibal, unwilling to do anything that might disturb the smoothness of her mind-set, nevertheless managed to inject a soothing touch upon the surface of her mind.</p><p>听了这番话，她就没有再说什么。坚迪柏虽然不愿搅扰她的心灵，仍然破例在那个心灵的光滑表面上，注入一股具有镇定作用的精神力量。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You can still speak to me,” he said, after they were each enclosed in a space suit. “I can hear you if you think hard. Think the words hard and clearly, one by one. You can hear me now, can’t you?”</p><p>“你仍然可以跟我说话。”当他们都钻进厚重的太空衣之后，他对她说，“只要你尽力想着那些话，我就能够听到。把每个字都专心地、仔细地想一遍。你现在听得到我说话，是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Yes, Master,” she said.</p><p>“是的，师傅。”她答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He could see her lips move through the transparent faceplate and he said, “Say it without moving your lips, Novi. There is no radio in the kind of suits that scholars have. it is all done with the mind.”</p><p>隔着头盔的透明面板，他看得到她的嘴唇在嚅动，于是又说：“不要张开嘴巴来说话，诺微。学者的太空衣没有无线电设备，一切全靠心灵的作用。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her lips did not move and her look grew more anxious: Can you hear me, Master?</p><p>她的嘴唇果然不再嚅动，表情却变得更为急切不安。你能听到吗，师傅？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Perfectly well, thought Gendibal--and his lips did not move either: Do you hear me?</p><p>非常清楚，坚迪柏这么想，他的嘴也始终没有张开。你听得到我吗，诺微？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I do, Master.</p><p>听得到，师傅。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then come with me and do as I do.</p><p>那么跟我走，模仿着我的一举一动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They moved across. Gendibal knew the theory of it, even if he could handle the practice only moderately well. The trick was to keep one’s legs extended and together and to swing them from the hips alone. That kept the center of gravity moving in a straight line as the arms swung forward in steady alternation. He had explained this to Sura Novi and, without turning to look at her, he studied the stance of her body from the set of the motor areas of her brain.</p><p>他们开始沿着索链进行漫步。坚迪柏虽然技术不算纯熟，他对太空漫步的理论却相当了解。诀窍在于保持两腿伸直并拢，仅以臀部作为两腿摆荡的支点；随着双臂规律地轮流向前挥舞，重心就能沿着一条直线前进。刚才，他已经向苏拉·诺微解释过这个道理，现在他并没有转头去看她，而是从她的大脑运动区，直接判读她的动作与姿势。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a first-timer, she did very well, almost as well as Gendibal was managing to do. She repressed her own tensions and she followed directions. Gendibal found himself, once again, very pleased with her.</p><p>对一位初学者而言，她的表现非常好，几乎和坚迪柏不相上下。她的确压抑了紧张的情绪，完全遵照嘱咐行事。因而，坚迪柏再次觉得自己非常欣赏她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was, however, clearly glad to be on board ship again--and so was Gendibal. He looked about as he removed his space suit and was rather dumbfounded at the luxury and style of the equipment. He recognized almost nothing and his heart sank at the thought that he might have very little time to learn how to handle it all. He might have to transfer expertise directly from the man already on board, something that was never quite as satisfactory as true learning.</p><p>然而，当他们终于再度“脚踏实地”的时候，她仍旧大大松了一口气，而坚迪柏也有同感。他一面除去太空衣，一面打量着周遭的一切。各种设备的奢华与先进令他瞠目结舌，几乎没有一样东西是他认得出来的。他的心猛地一沉，因为他想到，不会有多少时间学习如何操作这些设备。看来他必须从康普那里直接吸取这些知识，这总是比不上真正的学习令人感到踏实。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then he concentrated on Compor. Compor was tall and lean, a few years older than himself, rather handsome in a slightly weak way, with tightly waved hair of a startling buttery yellow.</p><p>然后他将注意力集中在康普身上。康普又高又瘦，比他自己年长几岁，相当英俊却稍嫌文弱。而他一头波浪状的鬈发，竟是极其罕见的乳黄色。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And it was clear to Gendibal that this person was disappointed in, and even contemptuous of, the Speaker he was now meeting for the first time. What was more, he was entirely unsuccessful in hiding the fact.</p><p>坚迪柏一眼就看出来，此人显然对于这位首度谋面的发言者感到失望，甚至有点瞧不起。更糟的是，康普完全无法掩饰心中的感觉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal did not mind such things, on the whole. Compor was not a Trantorian--nor a full Second Foundationer--and he clearly had his illusions. Even the most superficial scan of his mind showed that. Among these was the illusion that true power was necessarily related to the appearance of power. He might, of course, keep his illusions as long as they did not interfere with what Gendibal needed, but at the present moment, this particular illusiondid so interfere.</p><p>通常，坚迪柏对这种事并不太在意。康普不是川陀人，也不算正式的第二基地分子，因此显然带着一些错觉。即使只是轻轻扫过他的心灵，都可以发现这一点。典型的错觉之一，就是以为真正的力量必须表里一致。其实，只要不会对坚迪柏造成妨碍，他大可保有那些错觉，可是此时此刻，这个典型错觉却会坏了大事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What Gendibal did was the mentalic equivalent of a snap of the fingers. Compor staggered slightly under the impress of a sharp but fleeting pain. There was an impress of enforced concentration that puckered the skin of his thought and left the man with the awareness of a casual but awesome power that could be utilized if the Speaker chose.</p><p>坚迪柏接下来的心灵行动，相当于普通人弹了一下手指。康普立刻感到一阵短暂的剧痛，身体不由自主微微晃了一下。他的大脑皮质被印出一道皱褶，令他留下不可磨灭的深刻印象，亦即发言者随时随地都能发出骇人的力量。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor was left with a vast respect for Gendibal.</p><p>康普随即对坚迪柏肃然起敬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said pleasantly, “I am merely attracting your attention, Compor, my friend. Please let me know the present whereabouts of your friend, Golan Trevize, and his friend, Janov Pelorat.”</p><p>坚迪柏以愉快的口吻说：“我只是想吸引你的注意力，康普，我的朋友。请让我知道你那位朋友葛兰·崔维兹，以及他的朋友詹诺夫·裴洛拉特目前的下落。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor said hesitantly, “Shall I speak in the presence of the woman, Speaker?”</p><p>康普犹豫地问道：“我该当着这位女士的面说吗，发言者？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“The woman, Compor, is an extension of myself. There is no reason, therefore, why you should not speak openly.”</p><p>“康普，这位女士就好像另一个我。因此，你根本不该有任何顾忌。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“As you say, Speaker. Trevize and Pelorat are now approaching a planet known as Gaia.”</p><p>“遵命，发言者。崔维兹和裴洛拉特两人，正向一颗名叫盖娅的行星推进。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“So you said in your last communication the other day. Surely they have already landed on Gaia and perhaps left again. They did not stay long on Sayshell Planet.”</p><p>“前几天，你在最后一次通讯中就提到了。照理说，他们应该早就登陆盖娅，也许都已经离开了。他们在赛协尔行星就没有停留多久。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“They had not yet landed during the time I followed them, Speaker. They were approaching the planet with great caution, pausing substantial periods between micro-Jumps. it is clear to me they have no information about the planet they are approaching and therefore hesitate.”</p><p>“当我还在跟踪他们的时候，发言者，他们尚未登陆盖娅。他们万分小心地一步步接近那颗行星，每次微跃前都犹豫了相当长的时间。我很清楚，他们是因为缺乏该行星的资料，所以才会踌躇不前。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Doyou have information, Compor?”</p><p>“你自己有任何资料吗，康普？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I have none, Speaker,” said Compor, “or at least my ship’s computer has none.”</p><p>“我也没有，发言者。”康普说，“至少，这艘太空艇的电脑并没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“This computer?” Gendibal’s eyes fell upon the control panel and he asked in sudden hope, “Can it aid usefully in running the ship?”</p><p>“这台电脑吗？”坚迪柏目光落在控制板上，突然满怀希望地问道，“它能协助驾驶这艘太空艇吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It can run the ship completely, Speaker. One need merely think into it.”</p><p>“可以完全交给它自动驾驶，发言者，只要把思想灌注其中就行了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal felt suddenly uneasy. “The Foundation has gone that far?”</p><p>坚迪柏忽然感到有点不自在。“基地竟然做到这个地步了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Yes, but clumsily. The computer does not work well. I must repeat my thoughts several times and even then I get but minimal information.”</p><p>“没错，但不怎么高明。这台电脑并不太灵光，我必须将一个念头重复好几次，即使如此，我得到的反应也极其有限。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, “I may be able to do better than that.”</p><p>坚迪柏说：“我也许能让它有更佳的表现。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I am sure of it, Speaker,” said Compor respectfully.</p><p>“这点我绝对肯定，发言者。”康普以尊敬的口吻说道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But never mind that for the moment. Why does it have no information on Gaia?”</p><p>“不过暂时先别管这个。为什么电脑中没有盖娅的资料？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I do not know, Speaker. It claims to have--as far as a computer may be said to be able toclaim --records on every human-inhabited planet in the Galaxy.”</p><p>“我不知道，发言者。它曾经宣称——真像人类的口气——它拥有银河中每一颗住人行星的记录。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It cannot have more information than has been fed into it and if those who did the feeding thought they had records of all such planets when, in actual fact, they had not, then the computer would labor under the same misapprehension. Correct?”</p><p>“它拥有的资料不可能超过原先输入的。如果当初负责输入的人员，认为他们已经搜集到所有住人行星的记录，那么尽管事实并非如此，电脑仍旧会自以为是。这样说是否正确？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Certainly, Speaker.”</p><p>“当然正确，发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Did you inquire at Sayshell?”</p><p>“你在赛协尔曾经打听过吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Speaker,” said Compor uneasily, “there are people who speak of Gaia on Sayshell, but what they say is valueless. Clearly superstition. The tale they tell is that Gaia is a powerful world that held off even the Mule.”</p><p>“发言者，”康普显得有些不安，“赛协尔上的确有人在谈论盖娅，可是他们的说法毫无可取之处，可以确定都是迷信。根据那些传说，盖娅是个威力强大的世界，连当年的骡都不敢接近。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Is that what they say, indeed?” said Gendibal, suppressing excitement. “Were you so sure that this was superstition that you asked for no details?”</p><p>“他们真是这么说的吗？”坚迪柏压抑住激动的情绪，“你那么确定它只是迷信，所以没有再询问细节吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“No, Speaker. I asked a great deal, but what I have just told you is all that anyone can say. They can speak on the subject at great length, but when they have done so, all that it boils down to is what I have just said.”</p><p>“不，发言者，我问了一大堆。不过我刚才告诉你的，就是他们所能告诉我的一切。他们都能就这个题目滔滔不绝，可是仔细分析过滤之后，就只剩下我刚才报告的内容。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Apparently,” said Gendibal, “that is what Trevize has heard, too, and he goes to Gaia for some reason connected with that--to tap this great power, perhaps. And he does so cautiously, for perhaps he also fears this great power.”</p><p>“显然，”坚迪柏说，“崔维兹也听到了这个传说，他前往盖娅的动机一定与此有关，也许就是去打探这个神秘的力量。而他会如此谨慎，可能是他自己也心存畏惧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“That is certainly possible, Speaker.”</p><p>“的确有这个可能，发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And yet you did not follow?”</p><p>“你却没有继续跟踪下去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I did follow, Speaker, long enough to make sure he was indeed making for Gaia. I then returned here to the outskirts of the Gaian system.”</p><p>“发言者，我跟踪了好长的距离，足以肯定他的确是要前往盖娅。然后我就回到了这里，也就是盖娅行星系的外缘。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why?”</p><p>“为什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Three reasons, Speaker. First, you were about to arrive and I wanted to meet you at least partway and bring you aboard at the earliest moment, as you had directed. Since my ship has a hyperrelay on board, I could not move too far away from Trevize and Pelorat without rousing suspicion on Terminus, but I judged I could risk moving this far. Second, when it was clear that Trevize was approaching Gaia Planet very slowly, I judged there would be time enough for me to move toward you and hasten our meeting without being overtaken by events, especially since you would be more competent than I to follow him to the planet itself and to handle any emergency that might arise.”</p><p>“我有三个理由，发言者。第一，你即将抵达此地，我希望至少能在中途与你会合，让你尽快登上我的太空艇，而这也是你的指示。由于太空艇上有个超波中继器，如果我离崔维兹和裴洛拉特太远，一定会令端点星当局起疑。但是我判断，应该还能冒险来到这么远的地方。第二，当我确定崔维兹以极缓慢的方式接近盖娅，我就判断自己能有足够的时间，可以赶来尽快跟你会合，而不至于耽误任何事。何况，你比我更适合跟踪他到那颗行星，也比我更有能力处理任何紧急状况。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Quite true. And the third reason?”</p><p>“有道理。第三个理由呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Since our last communication, Speaker, something has happened that I did not expect and do not understand. I felt that--for that reason, too--I had better hasten our meeting as soon as I dared.”</p><p>“在我们上次通讯之后，发言者，又发生了一个变故，我完全没有料到，也不了解它的意义。我认为，即使基于这个理由，我也最好尽快和你碰面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And this event that you did not expect and do not understand?”</p><p>“这个你没有料到也不了解的变故，究竟是什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Ships of the Foundation fleet are approaching the Sayshellian frontier. My computer has picked up this information from Sayshellian news broadcasts. At least five advanced ships are in the flotilla and these have enough power to overwhelm Sayshell.”</p><p>“基地的战舰正在接近赛协尔边境，这则消息是我的电脑从赛协尔新闻广播中收到的。这个小型舰队至少拥有五艘新型战舰，拥有足够的力量攻陷整个赛协尔。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal did not answer at once, for it would not do to show that he had not expected such a move--or that he didn’t understand it. So, after a moment, he said negligently, “Do you suppose that this has something to do with Trevize’s movement toward Gaia?”</p><p>坚迪柏没有立即回答，他不能表现得未曾料到这个行动，或是自己也不了解其中的意义。因此，过了一会儿，他用不当一回事的口吻说：“你认为，这和崔维兹前往盖娅的行动有关吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It certainly came immediately afterward--and if B follows A, then there is at least a possibility that A caused B,” said Compor.</p><p>“这件事显然是在他出发后立刻发生的。如果乙事件出现在甲事件之后，那么乙至少有可能是由甲引起的。”康普答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Well then, it seems we all converge upon Gaia--Trevize, and I, and the First Foundation. --Come, you acted well, Compor,” said Gendibal, “and here is what we will now do. First, you will show me how this computer works and, through that, how the ship may be handled. I am sure that will not take long.</p><p>“嗯，所以说，我们似乎都汇聚到盖娅这个焦点来了。包括崔维兹、我自己，还有第一基地。嘿，你做得很好，康普。”坚迪柏说，“让我告诉你现在该做些什么。首先，你要教我如何操作这台电脑，以及如何利用它来操纵这艘船。我相信，这要不了多少时间。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“After that, you will get into my ship, since by then I will have impressed on your mind how to handle it. You will have no trouble maneuvering it, although I must tell you (as you have no doubt guessed from its appearance) that you will find it primitive indeed. Once you are in control of the ship, you will keep it here and wait for me.”</p><p>“接下来，你就登上我的太空船，我会先将它的操作方法灌输到你心中，你可以毫不费力地驾驶它。只不过我必须告诉你，想必你已经从它的外形猜到了，你将发现它极为原始。一旦你能控制那艘太空船，就让它停在原处等我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“How long, Speaker?”</p><p>“等多久，发言者？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Until I come for you. I do not expect to be gone long enough for you to be in danger of running out of supplies, but if I am unduly delayed, you may find your way to some inhabited planet of the Sayshell union and wait there. Wherever you are, I will find you.”</p><p>“直到我回来为止。我不会去太久的，你不必担心补给品会用光。但如果我耽搁得太久，你可以降落在赛协尔联盟任何一颗住人行星上，在那里继续等我。不论你在何处，我都找得到你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“As you say, Speaker.”</p><p>“遵命，发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And do not be alarmed. I can handle this mysterious Gaia and, if need be, the five ships of the Foundation as well.”</p><p>“还有，你大可不必惊慌。我有能力对付这个神秘的盖娅，必要的时候，也能一并对付那五艘基地战舰。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>4</p><p>4</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Littoral Thoobing had been the Foundation’s Ambassador to Sayshell for seven years. He rather liked the position.</p><p>黎托洛·杜宾担任基地驻赛协尔大使已有七年之久，他颇为喜欢这个职位。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tall and rather stout, he wore a thick brown mustache at a time when the predominant fashion, both in the Foundation and in Sayshell, was smooth-shaven. He had a strongly lined countenance, though he was only fifty-four--and was much given to a schooled indifference. His attitude toward his work was not easily seen.</p><p>杜宾身材很高，也算得上壮硕。虽然如今不论在基地或赛协尔，男性大多把脸刮得干干净净，他却仍留着两撇浓密的棕色胡须。虽然他只有五十四岁，却已经满脸皱纹，而且修炼到喜怒不形于色的境界。此外，也很难看出他对工作所抱持的心态。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Still, he rather liked the position. It kept him away from the hurly-burly of polities on Terminus--something he appreciated-- and it gave him the chance to live the life of a Sayshellian sybarite and to support his wife and daughter in the style to which they had become addicted. He didn’t want his life disturbed.</p><p>话说回来，他还是相当喜欢这个职位。它不但能让他远离端点星政坛的风风雨雨（他对这点分外满意），还让他捡到一个难得的机会，享受着赛协尔上流社会的悠闲逸乐，而且使得妻女过着令她们上瘾的生活。因此，他绝不希望这一切受到任何搅扰。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On the other hand, he rather disliked Liono Kodell, perhaps because Kodell also sported a mustache, though one which was smaller, shorter, and grayish-white. In the old days, they had been the only two people in prominent public life who had worn one and there had been rather a competition between them over the matter. Now (thought Thoobing) there was none; Kodell’s was contemptible.</p><p>杜宾相当讨厌里奥诺·柯代尔，也许是因为他也故意留着两撇胡子。只不过柯代尔的胡子较短较疏，而且已经变得灰白。过去曾有一段日子，公众人物之中只有他们两人留着八字胡，两人还在这方面较过劲。如今（杜宾想）比赛早已结束，柯代尔的胡子已经不入流了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell had been Director of Security when Thoobing was still on Terminus, dreaming of opposing Harla Branno in the race for Mayor, until he had been bought off with the ambassadorship. Branno had done it for her own sake, of course, but he had ended up owing her goodwill for that.</p><p>当杜宾仍在端点星上，梦想着要跟赫拉·布拉诺角逐市长宝座时，柯代尔已经出任安全局长多年。但早在选举之前，杜宾就接受了大使职位当做交换。布拉诺这么做当然是为了自己，但他还是欠了她一份情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But not to Kodell, somehow. Perhaps it was because of Kodell’s determined cheerfulness--the manner in which he was always such afriendly person--even after he had decided on just exactly the manner in which your throat was to be cut.</p><p>偏偏他对柯代尔一点都不领情。或许因为柯代尔有一张坚定的笑脸，而且总是表现得那么亲切友善——即使他早已决定用哪一号手法切断你的喉管。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now he sat there in hyperspatial image, cheerful as ever, brimming over with bonhomie. His actual body was, of course, back on Terminus, which spared Thoobing the necessity of offering him any physical sign of hospitality.</p><p>现在，柯代尔的超空间影像正坐在那里，依旧是满面春风，而且敦厚淳朴的态度溢于言表。当然，他的肉身仍在端点星上，杜宾因此得以省却一切实质的客套。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Kodell,” he said. “I want those ships withdrawn.”</p><p>“柯代尔，”他说，“我要那些战舰马上撤走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell smiled sunnily. “Why, so do I, but the old lady has made up her mind.”</p><p>柯代尔露出快活的笑容。“哈，我也这么想，可是老太婆下定决心了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You’ve been known to persuade her out of this or that.”</p><p>“谁都知道你一向能说服她改变心意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“On occasion. Perhaps. When she wanted to be persuaded. This time she doesn’t want to be. --Thoobing, do your job. Keep Sayshell calm.”</p><p>“或许偶尔吧，当她愿意听劝的时候，这回她可不愿意听。杜宾，做好你的份内工作，让赛协尔保持冷静。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I’m not thinking about Sayshell, Kodell. I’m thinking about the Foundation.”</p><p>“我并不是担心赛协尔，柯代尔，我是在为基地着想。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“So are we all.”</p><p>“这点大家都一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Kodell, don’t fence. I want you to listen to me.”</p><p>“柯代尔，别闪烁其词，我要你听我说。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Gladly, but these are hectic times on Terminus and I will not listen to you forever.”</p><p>“我很愿意，可是目前端点星上热闹着呢，我可不能永远坐在这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I will be as brief as I can be--when discussing the possibility of the Foundation’s destruction. If this hyperspatial line is not being tapped, I will speak openly.”</p><p>“我会尽可能长话短说，但我要讨论基地因此毁灭的可能性。如果这条超空间热线没遭到窃听，我就敢畅所欲言。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It is not being tapped.”</p><p>“我保证没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Then let me go on. I have received a message some days ago from one Golan Trevize. I recall a Trevize in my own political days, a Commissioner of Transportation.”</p><p>“那就让我继续说下去。几天前，有个名叫葛兰·崔维兹的人送了一道电讯给我。我记得我还在端点星政坛的时候，有一个名叫崔维兹的同僚，当时担任运输署长。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“The young man’s uncle,” Kodell said.</p><p>“他是那个年轻人的叔叔。”柯代尔答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Ah, then you know the Trevize who sent the message to me. According to the information I have since gathered, he was a Councilman who, after the recent successful resolution of a Seldon Crisis, was arrested and sent into exile.”</p><p>“啊，所以说，你认识那个送信给我的崔维兹。根据我后来搜集到的资料，他原本是一名议员，在最近那次谢顿危机圆满解决之后，他立刻被捕，随即遭到放逐。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>“完全正确。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I don’t believe it.”</p><p>“我不相信这回事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“What is it that you don’t believe?”</p><p>“你不相信哪回事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“That he was sent into exile.”</p><p>“他遭到放逐这回事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“为何不信？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“When in history has any citizen of the Foundation been sent into exile?” demanded Thoobing. “He is arrested or not arrested. If he is arrested, he is tried or not tried. If he is tried, he is convicted or not convicted. If he is convicted, he is fined, demoted, disgraced, imprisoned, or executed. No one is sent into exile.”</p><p>“在基地的历史上，有哪个基地公民曾遭到放逐？”杜宾追问，“一个公民倘若涉嫌犯罪，他就有可能遭到逮捕；如果他真的遭到逮捕，他就有可能接受审判；如果他真的接受审判，他就有可能会被定罪；如果他真的被定罪，他会被罚款、被降级、被罢黜、被监禁，甚至被处决。可是，从来没有人遭到放逐。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“There is always a first time.”</p><p>“凡事总有头一遭。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Nonsense. In an advanced naval vessel? What fool can fail to see that he is on a special mission for your old woman? Whom can she possibly expect to deceive?”</p><p>“胡说八道。放逐到一艘先进的军用航具上？哪个笨蛋看不出他是在为老太婆执行一项特殊任务？她指望能骗倒什么人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“What would the mission be?”</p><p>“会是什么样的任务呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Supposedly to find the planet Gaia.”</p><p>“想必是要寻找盖娅那颗行星。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Some of the cheerfulness left Kodell’s face. An unaccustomed hardness entered his eyes. He said, “I know that you feel no overwhelming impulse to believe my statements, Mr. Ambassador, but I make a special plea that you believe me in this one case. Neither the Mayor nor I had ever heard of Gaia at the time that Trevize was sent into exile. We have heard of Gaia, for the first time, just the other day. If you believe that, this conversation may continue.”</p><p>柯代尔脸上的笑容消失了大半，双眼射出异乎寻常的严厉目光。他说：“我知道你并不怎么觉得应该相信我的陈述，大使先生，但是我现在要郑重请求你，这次你无论如何要相信我。当崔维兹遭到放逐之际，不论市长或是我自己，都还没有听说过盖娅。几天前，我们两人才头一次听到盖娅这个名字。假如你相信这一点，我们才能继续谈下去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I will suspend my tendency toward skepticism long enough to accept that, Director, though it is difficult to do so.”</p><p>“虽说实在很困难，局长，但我会暂时收起凡事抱持怀疑态度的习性，试着接受这个说法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It is quite true, Mr. Ambassador, and if I have suddenly adopted a formal note to my statements it is because when this is done, you will find that you have questions to answer and that you will not find the occasion joyful. You speak as though Gaia is a world familiar to you. How is it that you know something we did not know? Is it not your duty to see to it that we know everything that you know about the political unit to which you are assigned?”</p><p>“的确很困难，大使先生。假如我突然采用了正式的语气，那是因为当我说完这些话之后，你将发现自己需要回答一些问题，而这些问题并不怎么轻松有趣。根据你的说法，你好像对盖娅这个世界十分熟悉。你怎么会知道一些我们不知道的事？你被派驻到那个政治实体的首要职责，难道不就是让我们知道你风闻的每件事吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thoobing said softly, “Gaia is not part of the Sayshell union. It, in fact, probably does not exist. Am I to transmit to Terminus all the fairy tales that the superstitious lower orders of Sayshell tell of Gaia? Some of them say that Gaia is located in hyperspace. According to others, it is a world that supernaturally protects Sayshell. According to still others, it sent forth the Mule to prey on the Galaxy. If you are planning to tell the Sayshellian government that Trevize has been sent out to find Gaia and that five advanced ships of the Foundation Navy have been sent out to back him in this search, they will never believe you. The people may believe fairy tales about Gaia, but the government does not--and they will not be convinced that the Foundation does. They will feel that you intend to force Sayshell into the Foundation Federation.”</p><p>杜宾以和缓的语气答道：“盖娅并不是赛协尔联盟的一部分，事实上，它可能根本就不存在。难道说，赛协尔低下阶层所流传的所有神话和迷信，我都得一字不漏地传达给端点星？他们有些人说盖娅位于超空间，有些人则说，它一直以超自然力量在保护赛协尔，此外还有人说，当年就是它派出骡来劫掠银河的。如果你打算告诉赛协尔政府，崔维兹的任务是要寻找盖娅，而基地舰队的五艘先进战舰来到这里，是为了支援他的探索任务，他们是绝对不会接受的。民众也许会相信有关盖娅的神话，政府可没有那么好骗，而他们也不会相信基地竟然那么天真。他们会认为，你们想以武力迫使赛协尔加入基地联邦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And what if we do plan that?”</p><p>“假如我们真有这个打算呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It would be fatal. Come, Kodell, in the five-century history of the Foundation, when have we fought a war of conquest? We have fought wars to prevent our own conquest--and failed once--but no war has ended with an extension of our territory. Accessions to the Federation have been through peaceful agreements. We have been joined by those who saw benefits in joining.”</p><p>“那将一发不可收拾。想想看，柯代尔，在基地五个世纪的历史中，我们何曾发动过侵略战争？我们打仗都是为了抵御外侮，还败过一次，可是没有任何战争曾经为我们开拓版图。其他世界都是通过和平协议加入联邦的，他们之所以加盟，是因为看到了加盟的好处。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Isn’t it possible that Sayshell may see benefits in joining?”</p><p>“赛协尔就没有可能看到这些好处吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“They will never do so while our ships remain on their borders. Withdraw them.”</p><p>“只要我们的战舰停在他们的边境，他们就永远看不到。赶快把战舰撤走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It can’t be done.”</p><p>“办不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Kodell, Sayshell is a marvelous advertisement for the benevolence of the Foundation Federation. It is nearly enclosed by our territory, it is in an utterly vulnerable position, and yet until now it has been safe, has gone its own way, has even been able to maintain an anti-Foundation foreign policy freely. How better can we show the Galaxy that we force no one, that we come in friendship to all? --If we take over Sayshell, we take that which, in essence, we already have. After all, we dominate it economically--if quietly. But if we take it over by military force, we advertise to all the Galaxy that we have become expansionist.”</p><p>“柯代尔，赛协尔是个极佳的宣传工具，足以显示基地联邦如何宽大为怀。它几乎被我们的疆域包围，全然无险可守，但直到目前为止，它始终安然无事，我行我素，甚至能够肆意维持反基地的对外政策。这是多么好的样板，能让全银河都知道，我们从不以武力使人就范，我们总是伸出友谊之手。赛协尔等于是我们的囊中物，即使拿下它也是多此一举。毕竟，我们在经济上早已宰制他们——虽说并未公开。但是倘若动武将它拿下，我们无异于向全银河宣传，我们已经变成扩张主义者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And if I tell you that we are really interested only in Gaia?”</p><p>“如果我告诉你，我们真的只是对盖娅有兴趣呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Then I will believe it no more than the Sayshell union will. This man, Trevize, sends me a message that he is on his way to Gaia and asks me to transmit it to Terminus. Against my better judgment, I do so because I must and, almost before the hyperspatial line is cool, the Foundation Navy is in motion. How will you get to Gaia, without penetrating Sayshellian space?”</p><p>“那么，我会跟赛协尔联盟一样不信这种鬼话。那个叫崔维兹的人，送了一道电讯给我，说他正要前往盖娅，并请我将那则电讯转交端点星。我照做了，虽然我判断这样做并不妥当，但是我没有选择的余地。结果，在超空间热线还来不及冷却的时候，基地舰队就开始行动了。若不穿越赛协尔的星空，你们要怎样抵达盖娅？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Mydear Thoobing, surely you are not listening to yourself. Did you not tell me just a few minutes ago that Gaia, if it exists at all, is not part of the Sayshell union? And I presume you know that hyperspace is free to all and is part of no world’s territory. How then can Sayshell complain if we move from Foundation territory (where our ships stand right now), through hyperspace, into Gaian territory, and never in the process occupy a single cubic centimeter of Sayshellian territory?”</p><p>“我亲爱的杜宾，显然你没有注意自己讲的话。仅仅几分钟之前，你还明明告诉我，盖娅假如真的存在，也不是赛协尔联盟的一部分。我想你总该知道，超空间并非任何世界的领域，谁都可以自由进出。如果我们从基地的疆域——我们的战舰目前正在那里待命——经由超空间进入盖娅的疆域，从头到尾始终不占赛协尔一立方公分的星空，赛协尔又怎么会抱怨呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Sayshell will not interpret events like that, Kodell. Gaia, if it exists at all, is totally enclosed by the Sayshell union, even if it is not a political part of it, and there are precedents that make such enclaves virtual parts of the enclosing territory, as far as enemy warships are concerned.”</p><p>“赛协尔可不会这样解释，柯代尔。盖娅假如真的存在，虽然并非赛协尔联盟的一部分，却被联盟整个包围在内。根据星际惯例，赛协尔可将它视为自己的势力范围，至少对敌方战舰可以如此解释。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Ours are not enemy warships. We are at peace with Sayshell.”</p><p>“我们不是什么敌方战舰，我们准备跟赛协尔和平共处。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I tell you that Sayshell may declare war. They won’t expect to win such a war through military superiority, but the fact is, war will set off a wave of anti-Foundation activity throughout the Galaxy. The new expansionist policies of the Foundation will encourage the growth of alliances against us. Some of the members of the Federation will begin to rethink their ties to us. We may well lose the war through internal disarray and we will then certainly reverse the process of growth that has served the Foundation so well for five hundred years.”</p><p>“我告诉你，赛协尔有可能因此宣战。他们明白这是一场实力悬殊的战争，不会指望赢得军事胜利，但问题是，这场战争足以引发泛银河的反基地风潮。基地新近采取的扩张政策，会促使反基地的势力骤然壮大。联邦某些成员也会重新考虑和我们的关系，我们很可能会因为内部动乱而战败。五百年来，基地一直在成长茁壮，这样一来，就注定要走回头路了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Come, come, Thoobing,” said Kodell indifferently, “You speak as though five hundred years is nothing, as though we are still the Foundation of Salvor Hardin’s time, fighting the pocket-kingdom of Anacreon. We are far stronger now than the Galactic Empire ever was at its very height. A squadron of our ships could defeat the entire Galactic Navy, occupy any Galactic sector, and never know it had been in a fight.”</p><p>“得了，得了，杜宾，”柯代尔不以为然地说，“你这种说法，好像把五百年的绩业一笔勾销，好像我们还活在塞佛·哈定的时代，正准备对抗那个袖珍王国安纳克里昂。事实上，即使跟银河帝国黄金时代的国势相比，我们现在也比他们强大许多。我们随便一个分遣队，都能在战士们不知不觉间，就击败整个帝国舰队，占领银河任何星区。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“We are not fighting the Galactic Empire. We fight planets and sectors of our own time.”</p><p>“我们可不是跟银河帝国作战，我们的敌人来自当今各个行星和星区。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Who have not advanced as we have. We could gather in all the Galaxy now.”</p><p>“他们都没有像我们这么先进的科技，我们现在就足以收服整个银河。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“According to the Seldon Plan, we can’t do that for another five hundred years.”</p><p>“根据谢顿计划，五百年内，我们都还不能那么做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“The Seldon Plan underestimates the speed of technological advance. We can do it now! --Understand me, I don’t say wewill do it now or evenshould do it now. I merely say wecan do it now.”</p><p>“谢顿计划低估了科技发展的速度。我们现在就能这么做！请你听清楚，我不是说我们现在‘将要’这么做，甚至不是说现在‘应该’这么做，我只是说我们现在‘能够’这么做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Kodell, you have lived all your life on Terminus. You don’t know the Galaxy. Our Navy and our technology can beat down the Armed Forces of other worlds, but we cannot yet govern an entire rebellions, hate-ridden Galaxy--and that is what it will be if we take it by force. Withdraw the ships!”</p><p>“柯代尔，你一辈子住在端点星上，完全不了解银河的局势。我们所拥有的舰队和科技，的确能够击败其他世界的军队，可是我们若以武力征服他们，注定会造成一个叛乱此起彼落、处处充满敌意的局面，我们并没有能力统治这样的银河。赶快撤走那些战舰！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It can’t be done, Thoobing. Consider-- What if Gaia is not a myth?”</p><p>“我说过办不到，杜宾。你想想看，万一盖娅并非只是神话呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thoobing paused, scanning the other’s face as though anxious to read his mind. “A world in hyperspace not a myth?”</p><p>杜宾顿了顿，趁机打量柯代尔的脸孔，仿佛急于窥知对方的心思。“位于超空间的世界还不是神话？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“A world in hyperspace is superstition, but even superstitions may be built around kernels of truth. This man, Trevize, who was exiled, speaks of it as though it were a real world in real space. What if he is right?”</p><p>“位于超空间的世界当然是迷信，但即使是迷信，核心也可能藏有真相。那个人，那个遭到放逐的崔维兹，照他的说法，盖娅好像是普通空间中的真实世界。万一他说对了呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Nonsense. I don’t believe it.”</p><p>“荒唐，我可不相信。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“No? Believe it for just a moment. A real world that has lent Sayshell safety against the Mule and against the Foundation!”</p><p>“不相信？能否请你暂且相信它是真实的世界，曾经保护赛协尔免于骡的侵略，如今又帮助它对抗基地！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But you refute yourself. How is Gaia keeping the Sayshellians safe from the Foundation? Are we not sending ships against it?”</p><p>“你这样说是自相矛盾，盖娅如何帮助赛协尔人抵御基地？我们不是正派出舰队吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Not against it, but against Gaia, which is so mysteriously unknown--which is so careful to avoid notice that while it is in real space it somehow convinces its neighbor worlds that it is in hyperspace--and which even manages to remain outside the computerized data of the best and most unabridged of Galactic maps.”</p><p>“舰队的目标不是赛协尔，而是盖娅。那个世界如此神秘莫测，又如此处心积虑地销声匿迹，它明明在太空某个角落，却有办法让邻近世界以为它在超空间中。甚至最精确、最完整的电脑化银河地图，也未能搜录它的资料。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It must be a most unusual world, then, for it must be able to manipulate minds.”</p><p>“那么，它必定是个极不寻常的世界，因为它必定有办法操控心灵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And did you not say a moment ago that one Sayshellian tale is that Gaia sent forth the Mule to prey upon the Galaxy? And could not the Mule manipulate minds?”</p><p>“而你刚才不是也说过，根据赛协尔的一则传说，骡就是盖娅派出来劫掠银河的？而骡不是也会操控心灵吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“And Gaia is a world of Mules, then?”</p><p>“那么，盖娅是个住满了骡的世界？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Are you sure it might not be?”</p><p>“你确定不是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why not a world of a reborn Second Foundation, in that case.”</p><p>“这样说来，它又为何不能是重生的第二基地呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why not indeed? Should it not be investigated?”</p><p>“是啊，为何不能？难道不该好好调查吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thoobing grew sober. He had been smiling scornfully during the last exchanges, but now he lowered his head and stared up from under his eyebrows. “If you are serious, is such an investigation not dangerous?”</p><p>杜宾渐渐冷静下来。他本来一直挂着轻蔑的笑容，现在却低下头，扬起眉毛瞪着对方。“如果你此话当真，这样的调查难道不危险吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Is it?”</p><p>“危险吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You answer my questions with other questions because you have no reasonable answers. Of what use will ships be against Mules or Second Foundationers? Is it not likely, in fact, that if they exist they are luring you into destruction? See here, you tell me that the Foundation can establish its Empire now, even though the Seldon Plan has reached only its midway point, and I have warned you that you would be racing too far ahead and that the intricacies of the Plan would slow you down by force. Perhaps, if Gaia exists and is what you say it is, all this is a device to bring about that slowdown. Do voluntarily now what you may soon be constrained to do. Do peacefully and without bloodshed now what you may be forced to do by woeful disaster. Withdraw the ships.”</p><p>“你用其他问题来回答我的问题，表示你心中没有合理的答案。如果敌人是一大群骡，或是第二基地，几艘战舰又能派上什么用场？事实上，万一这些推论成立，有没有可能盖娅正在引诱你们自取灭亡？听好，你说虽然谢顿计划只完成了一半，但基地如今已有能力建立一个帝国，而我也警告过你，你们这样做会冲得太快太远，谢顿计划一定有办法逼你们慢下来。假若盖娅真的存在，而且身份正如你所料，那么这一切或许就是个刹车的策略。现在就退兵吧，否则你们很快便会被迫撤退。现在还能以和平而不流血的方式收场，坚持下去就会演变成悲惨的败退。我再说一次，赶快撤走那些战舰。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It can’t be done. In fact, Thoobing, Mayor Branno herself plans to join the ships, and scoutships have already flitted through hyperspace to what is supposedly Gaian territory.”</p><p>“办不到就是办不到。老实告诉你，杜宾，布拉诺市长打算亲自登上战舰。而且，我们的斥候舰群已经飞掠超空间，顺利抵达理论上的盖娅领域。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thoobing’s eyes bulged. “There will surely be war, I tell you.”</p><p>杜宾的眼珠几乎要爆出来。“我警告你，这注定会引发一场战争。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You are our ambassador. Prevent that. Give the Sayshellians whatever assurances they need. Deny any ill will on our part. Tell them, if you have to, that it will pay them to sit quietly and wait for Gaia to destroy us. Say anything you want to, but keep them quiet.”</p><p>“你是我们的大使，你要设法阻止。不论赛协尔人需要什么保证，你都可以拍胸脯。同时，你要否认我方有任何不良企图。有必要的话，你索性告诉他们，最好的对策便是隔山观虎斗，等着让盖娅收拾我们。你爱怎么说都行，总之别让他们轻举妄动。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paused, searching Thoobing’s stunned expression, and said, “Really, that’s all. As far as I know, no Foundation ship will land on any world of the Sayshell union or penetrate any point in real space that is part of that union. However, any Sayshellian ship that attempts to challenge us outside union territory--and therefore inside Foundation territory--will promptly be reduced to dust. Make that perfectly clear, too, and keep the Sayshellians quiet. You will be held to strict account if you fail. You have had an easy job so far, Thoobing, but hard times are upon you and the next few weeks decide all. Fail us and no place in the Galaxy will be safe for you.”</p><p>他顿了顿，凝视着杜宾目瞪口呆的表情，然后又说：“真的，就是如此而已。据我所知，基地船舰不会登陆赛协尔联盟任何一个世界，也不会穿越属于联盟的任何空间。然而，如果赛协尔船舰离开他们的疆域，也就是进入基地的势力范围，想要向我们挑衅，就会立刻化成一团烟尘。把这点也跟他们切实讲清楚，别让赛协尔人轻举妄动。如果失败了，我们会好好跟你算账。直到目前为止，你做的都只是闲差事，杜宾，但是养兵千日用在一朝，未来几周将决定一切。假如你令我们失望，那么银河虽大，也没有你藏身之地。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was neither merriment nor friendliness in Kodell’s face as contact was broken and as his image disappeared.</p><p>当通讯陡然终止，影像消失之际，柯代尔脸上早已没有愉悦或友善的表情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Thoobing stared open-mouthed at the place where he had been</p><p>杜宾仍张大嘴巴，瞪着刚才柯代尔现身之处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>5</p><p>5</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Golan Trevize clutched at his hair as though he were trying, by feel, to judge the condition of his thinking. He said to Pelorat abruptly, “What is your state of mind?”</p><p>葛兰·崔维兹猛扯了一阵头发，仿佛想借着痛觉来判断自己的精神状况。他突然对裴洛拉特说：“你现在的心理状态如何？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“State of mind?” said Pelorat blankly.</p><p>“心理状态？”裴洛拉特摸不着头脑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Yes. Here we are, trapped--with our ship under outside control and being drawn inexorably to a world we know nothing about. Do you feel panic?”</p><p>“对啊。我们被逮到了，我们的太空艇遭到外力控制，被硬生生拉向一个完全未知的世界。你有没有感到惊慌？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat’s long face registered a certain melancholia. “No,” he said. “I don’t feel joyful. I do feel a little apprehensive, but I’m not panicky.”</p><p>裴洛拉特的长脸显露出些许忧郁。“没有。”他答道，“我并未感到欢喜，也的确有点担心，可是没有惊慌失措。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Neither am I. Isn’t that odd? Why aren’t we more upset than we are?”</p><p>“我也没有，这不是很奇怪吗？我们应该万分慌乱，为什么没有这种反应呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“This is something we expected, Golan.Something like this.”</p><p>“这种不寻常的事，葛兰，正是我们所预期的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize turned to the screen. It remained firmly focused on the space station. It was larger now, which meant they were closer.</p><p>崔维兹转身面向屏幕，它始终锁定着太空站的画面。只不过现在太空站变得更大，代表他们更接近了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It seemed to him that it was not an impressive space station in design. There was nothing to it that bespoke superscience. In fact, it seemed a bit primitive. --Yet it had the ship in its grip.</p><p>在他看来，那座太空站外形没什么惊人之处，看不出有任何超人的科学。事实上，它似乎还有点原始——但它有办法制住太空艇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, “I’m being very analytical, Janov. Cool! --I like to think that I am not a coward and that I can behave well under pressure, but I tend to flatter myself. Everyone does. I should be jumping up and down right now and sweating a little. We may have expectedsomething , but that doesn’t change the fact that we are helpless and that we may be killed.”</p><p>他说：“我的思绪仍然条理分明，詹诺夫，简直怪透了！我很想相信这是因为我并非懦夫，在巨大压力下也能有优异的表现。这令我引以为傲，我想每个人都免不了。事实上，我现在该坐立不安，还会冒出一点冷汗。我们或许预期到了会有不寻常的事，但那于事无补。我们现在仍旧一筹莫展，而且可能会惨遭杀害。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat said, “I don’t think so, Golan. If the Gaians could take over the ship at a distance, couldn’t they kill us at a distance? If we’re still alive--”</p><p>裴洛拉特说：“我可不这么想，葛兰。如果盖娅星人能从远方接掌太空艇，难道就不能远距离杀害我们吗？既然我们还活着……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But we’re not altogether untouched. We’re too calm, I tell you. I think they’ve tranquilized us.”</p><p>“但我们并非完全安然无事，我说过我们太过冷静。我想，他们给我们打了无形镇静剂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why?”</p><p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“To keep us in good shape mentally, I think. It’s possible they wish to question us. After that, they may kill us.”</p><p>“为了让我们的精神状态完好如初吧，我这么想。可能是希望审问我们，之后或许就会把我们杀掉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“If they are rational enough to want to question us, they may be rational enough not to kill us for no good reason.”</p><p>“假如他们想要审问我们，就代表他们有足够的理性。因此，如果没有什么正当理由，他们不会无缘无故杀害我们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize leaned back in his chair (it bent back at least--they hadn’t deprived the chair of its functioning) and placed his feet on the desk where ordinarily his hands made contact with the computer. He said, “They may be quite ingenious enough to work up what they consider a good reason. --Still, if they’ve touched our minds, It hasn’t been by much. If it were the Mule, for instance, he would have made useager to go--exalted, exultant, every fiber of ourselves crying out for arrival there.” He pointed to the space station. “Do you feel that way, Janov?”</p><p>崔维兹上身往椅背用力一靠（椅背立刻向后弯曲，他们至少没有剥夺座椅的功能），双脚摆到书桌上，那里原是他的双手与电脑进行接触的地方。他说：“他们也许相当聪明，足以罗织一个自认为正当无比的理由。话说回来，他们即使影响了我们的心灵，也没有做得太过分。比方说，换成骡的话，他会让我们渴望赶快走，我们会迫不及待，会血脉贲张，每一根神经都会狂喊着赶快。”他伸手指了指太空站，“你有这种感觉吗，詹诺夫？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Certainly not.”</p><p>“当然没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You see that I’m still in a state where I can indulge in cool, analytical reasoning. Very odd! Or can I tell? Am I in a panic, incoherent, mad--and merely under the illusion that I am indulging in cool, analytical reasoning?”</p><p>“你看，我也没有什么变化，仍然可以尽情地冷静分析和推理。实在太奇怪了！可是我能肯定吗？我是不是处于一种惊惶、慌乱、疯狂的状态，却产生了一种幻觉，以为自己正在尽情地冷静分析和推理？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat shrugged. “You seem sane to me. Perhaps I am as insane as you and am under the same illusion, but that sort of argument gets us nowhere. All humanity could share a common insanity and be immersed in a common illusion while living in a common chaos. That can’t be disproved, but we have no choice but to follow our senses.” And then, abruptly, he said, “In fact, I’ve been doing some reasoning myself.”</p><p>裴洛拉特耸了耸肩。“我觉得你的精神很正常。或许，是因为我的精神跟你一样不正常，处于同样的幻觉中，可是这种论证无济于事。也许所有的人类全部精神不正常，通通陷在一个集体幻觉中，而宇宙则是一片混沌。这种说法同样是无法反证的，可是我们除了相信自己的理智，根本没有其他的选择。”然后，他突然改变话题说：“事实上，我自己也在作一项推论。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“是什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Well, we talk about Gaia as a world of Mules, possibly, or as the Second Foundation reborn. Has it occurred to you that a third alternative exists, one that is more reasonable than either of the first two.”</p><p>“嗯，我们曾经猜想盖娅也许是骡的故乡，或是死灰复燃的第二基地。但是你有没有想到过，还有更合理的第三种可能性？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“What third alternative?”</p><p>“什么第三种可能性？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat’s eyes seemed concentrating inward. He did not look at Trevize and his voice was low and thoughtful. “We have a world-- Gaia--that has done its best, over an indefinite period of time, to maintain a strict isolation. It has in no way attempted to establish contact with any other world--not even the nearby worlds of the Sayshell union. It has an advanced science, in some ways, if the stories of their destruction of fleets is true and certainly their ability to control us right now bespeaks it--and yet they have made no attempt to expand their power. They ask only to be left alone.”</p><p>裴洛拉特没有望着崔维兹，他的眼睛似乎在凝视自己的内心，他的声音则变得低沉而意味深长。“不知道从多久以前开始，盖娅这个世界就在全力保持绝对的隔绝状态。它从未试图和其他世界接触，连它的近邻赛协尔联盟也不例外。如果他们击毁舰队的传说属实，它某一方面的科学必定极为先进，而他们现在有能力控制我们，当然更是一项明证。但他们却未曾试图扩张势力，唯一的要求只是不要受到打扰。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize narrowed his eyes. “So?”</p><p>崔维兹眯起眼睛。“所以呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It’s all very inhuman. The more than twenty thousand years of human history in space has been an uninterrupted tale of expansion and attempted expansion. Just about every known world that can be inhabitedis inhabited. Nearly every world has been quarreled over in the process and nearly every world has jostled each of its neighbors at one time or another. If Gaia is so inhuman as to be so different in this respect, it may be because it really is--inhuman.”</p><p>“这都不像人类的行径。人类两万多年的太空发展史，就是一部连续不断的扩张史。如今，能够住人的已知世界差不多都住了人。在殖民银河的过程中，几乎每颗行星都曾遭到你争我夺，几乎每个世界都跟邻邦抢过地盘。如果盖娅在这方面如此异于常人，或许因为它真是——非人的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize shook his head. “Impossible.”</p><p>崔维兹摇了摇头。“不可能。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why impossible?” said Pelorat warmly. “I’ve told you what a puzzle it is that the human race is the only evolved intelligence in the Galaxy. What if it isn’t? Might there not be one more--on one planet--that lacked the human expansionist drive? In fact,” Pelorat grew more excited, “what if there are a million intelligences in the Galaxy, but onlyone that is expansionist--ourselves? The others would all remain at home, unobtrusive, hidden--”</p><p>“为什么不可能？”裴洛拉特用急切的口吻说，“我曾经告诉你，人类是银河中唯一演化成功的智慧生物，而这是一个大谜。万一事实并非如此呢？难道就不可能在某颗行星上，还有另一种不像人类那样具有扩张倾向的智慧生物？事实上，”裴洛拉特愈说愈激动，“银河中搞不好有百万种智慧生物，却只有一种是扩张主义者，那就是我们。其他的都安分守己地待在母星，隐藏起来……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Ridiculous!” said Trevize. “We’d come across them. We’d land on their worlds. They would come in all types and stages of technology and most of them would be unable to stop us. But we’ve never come across any of them. Space! We’ve never even come across the ruins or relies of a nonhuman civilization, have we? You’re the historian, so you tell me. Have we?”</p><p>“简直荒谬！”崔维兹说，“果真如此，我们早就遇到他们了，因为我们早已登陆那些世界。他们会发展出各式各样和各种阶段的科技，大多数都无法阻止我们。但是，我们从来没有遇到任何一种。太空啊！我们甚至从未发现非人文明的遗迹或遗址，对不对？你是历史学家，请你告诉我，到底有没有？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat shook his head. “We haven’t. --But Golan, there could be one! This one!”</p><p>裴洛拉特摇了摇头。“的确没有发现过。可是葛兰，眼前也许就有一个！就是这个！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I don’t believe it. You say the name is Gaia, which is some ancient dialectical version of the name ‘Earth.’ How can that be nonhuman?”</p><p>“我可不相信。你说它叫做盖娅，那是源自一种古代方言，意思就是地球。怎么可能是非人文明呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“The name ‘Gaia’ is given the planet by human beings--and who knows why? The resemblance to an ancient word might be coincidental. --Come to think of it, the very fact that we’ve been lured to Gaia--as you explained in great detail some time ago--and are now being drawn in against our will is an argument in favor of the nonhumanity of the Gaians.”</p><p>“盖娅这个名字是人类帮它取的，谁知道又是为什么？至于和地球的古称相似，也许只是巧合罢了。你好好想一想，我们被引诱到盖娅来——这点你曾经仔细分析过——现在又被硬生生吸过去，这都是盖娅星人并非人类的佐证。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why? What has that to do with nonhumanity?”</p><p>“为什么？这跟他们是不是人类又有什么关系？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“They’recurious about us--about humans.”</p><p>“因为他们对我们——也就是对人类好奇。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, “Janov, you’re mad. They’ve been living in a Galaxy surrounded by humans for thousands of years. Why should they be curious right now? Why not long before? And if right now, whyus ? If they want to study human beings and human culture, why not the Sayshell worlds? Why would they reach all the way to Terminus for us?”</p><p>崔维兹说：“詹诺夫，你已经语无伦次。数千年来，盖娅周围的星空满是人类，他们为何现在才感到好奇？为什么以前没有好奇心？即使现在才好奇，又为何会选上我们？如果他们想要研究人类与其文化，何不利用赛协尔各个世界？为何大老远把我们从端点星引到这里来？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“They may be interested in the Foundation.”</p><p>“他们或许对基地有兴趣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Nonsense,” said Trevize violently. “Janov, youwant a nonhuman intelligence and youwill have one. Right now, I think that if you thought you were going to encounter nonhumans, you wouldn’t worry about having been captured, about being helpless, about being killed even--if they but gave you a little time to sate your curiosity.”</p><p>“胡说八道。”崔维兹激愤地说，“詹诺夫，你若一心想见非人智慧生物，那么终将如愿以偿。此时此刻，我猜如果你认为将要遇见非人生物，你就不会担心已经被捕，不会担心束手无策，甚至不会担心遭到杀害——只会担心他们不给你时间，满足你的好奇心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat began to stutter an indignant negative, then stopped, drew a deep breath, and said, “Well, you may be right, Golan, but I’ll hold to my belief for a while just the same. I don’t think we’ll have to wait very long to see who’s right. --Look!”</p><p>裴洛拉特气得结结巴巴，反驳了一大串，这才深深吸了一大口气，然后又说：“好吧，也许你对，葛兰，但我暂时还不想放弃这个信念。我想要不了多久，我们就能知道谁对谁错——你看！”他突然指向屏幕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He pointed to the screen. Trevize--who had, in his excitement, ceased watching--now looked back. “What is it?” he said.</p><p>崔维兹由于争辩得太过激动，视线早已离开屏幕，现在才回过头来。“什么东西？”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Isn’t that a ship taking off from the station?”</p><p>“是不是一艘刚从太空站起飞的船舰？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It’ssomething ,” admitted Trevize reluctantly. “I can’t make out the details yet and I can’t magnify the view any further. It’s at maximum magnification.” After awhile he said, “It seems to be approaching us and I suppose it’s a ship. Shall we make a bet?”</p><p>“是有个东西。”崔维兹回答得很勉强，“但我还看不清楚，也无法再将画面放大。放大率已经到了极限。”过了一会儿，他又说：“它似乎朝我们飞过来，我猜是一艘太空船。我们要不要打个赌？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“What sort of bet?”</p><p>“什么样的赌？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said sardonically, “If we ever get back to Terminus, let’s have a big dinner for ourselves and any guests we each care to invite, up to, say, four--and it will be on me if that ship approaching us carries nonhumans and on you if it carries humans.”</p><p>崔维兹用嘲讽的语气说：“如果还能回到端点星，我们就去大吃一顿，彼此还能请几个陪客，最多不超过，嗯，四个人吧。假如那艘太空船上载的不是人类，就由我请客，反之就记你的账。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I’m willing,” said Pelorat.</p><p>“我愿意赌。”裴洛拉特说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Done, then,” and Trevize peered at the screen, trying to make out details and wondering if any details could reasonably be expected to give away, beyond question, the nonhumanity (or humanity) of the beings on board</p><p>“一言为定。”崔维兹又开始盯着屏幕，试图把那艘太空船看得更清楚。但他自己也不禁怀疑，究竟会有什么特征，能让他百分之百确定里面载的是不是人类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>6</p><p>6</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Branno’s iron-gray hair lay immaculately in place and she might have been in the Mayoral Palace, considering her equanimity. She showed no sign that she was deep in space for only the second time in her life. (And the first time--when she accompanied her parents on a holiday tour to Kalgan--could scarcely count. She had been only three at the time.)</p><p>布拉诺的铁灰色头发梳得整齐光洁，看她这般气定神闲的模样，好像仍旧待在市长官邸，一点也看不出这是她有生以来第二次深入太空。（第一次几乎不能算数，那只是她跟着父母去卡尔根度假，当时她只有三岁。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said to Kodell with a certain weary heaviness, “It is Thoobing’s job, after all, to express his opinion and to warn me. Very well, he has warned me. I don’t hold it against him.”</p><p>她用带着些许厌倦的口气，对柯代尔说：“毕竟，杜宾的职责就是提供意见，并且适时警告我。很好，他的确很尽责，我不会怪他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell, who had boarded the Mayor’s ship in order to speak to her without the psychological difficulty of imaging, said, “He’s been at his post too long. He’s beginning to think like a Sayshellian.”</p><p>柯代尔跟市长在同一艘战舰上，这是为了方便与她面对面交谈，以避免影像沟通的心理障碍。他说：“他在那个职位上待得太久，想法已经快被赛协尔人同化了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“That’s the occupational hazard of an ambassadorship, Liono. Let us wait till this is over and we’ll give him a long sabbatical and then send him on to another assignment elsewhere. He’s a capable man.--After all, he did have the wit to forward Trevize’s message without delay.”</p><p>“那是大使这一行的职业风险之一，里奥诺。等这件事解决之后，我们让他休个长假，然后把他调到别的地方去。他算得上是个能干的人，至少，他还有点警觉性，晓得及时回报崔维兹的消息。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell smiled briefly. “Yes, he told me he did it against his better judgment. ‘I do so because I must’ he said. You see, Madam Mayor, he had to, even against his better judgment, because as soon as Trevize entered the space of the Sayshell union, I informed Ambassador Thoobing to forward, at once, any and all information concerning him?’</p><p>柯代尔浅浅一笑。“没错，他告诉我，虽然他判断这样做并不妥当，‘但是我没有选择的余地’，他就是这么说的。你看，市长女士，即使他判断这样做并不妥当，他也不得不做。因为当初崔维兹刚进入赛协尔联盟的星空，我就通知了这位杜宾大使，要他即刻把关于那小子的消息通通转来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Oh?” Mayor Branno turned in her seat to see his face more clearly. “And what made you do that?”</p><p>“哦？”布拉诺市长换了一下坐姿，好把柯代尔的脸看得更清楚。“你又为何那么做？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Elementary considerations, actually. Trevize was using a late-model Foundation naval vessel and the Sayshellians would be bound to noticethat . He’s an undiplomatic young jackass and they would be bound to noticethat . Therefore, he might get into trouble--and if there’s one thing a Foundationer knows, it is that if he gets into trouble anywhere in the Galaxy, he can cry out for the nearest Foundation representative. Personally I wouldn’t mind seeing Trevize in trouble--it might help him grow up and that would do him a great deal of good--but you’ve sent him out as your lightning rod and I wanted you to be able to estimate the nature of any lightning that might strike, so I made sure that the nearest Foundation representative would keep watch over him, that’s all.”</p><p>“其实，只是基于最简单的考量。崔维兹驾着一艘新型的基地军用航具，这点赛协尔人必定会注意到。他又是个不具外交身份的小傻瓜，这点他们必定也会注意到。因此，他有可能遇上麻烦，而基地人最清楚的一件事，就是不论在银河何处遇到麻烦，都能求助于最近的基地驻外代表。老实说，我个人并不在乎崔维兹遇到什么麻烦，那也许还能帮助他早点长大，对他有莫大的助益。可是你送他出去，是要他当你的避雷针，所以我要确保他发挥功能，当闪电击下时，能让你估算出闪电的源头。因此我特别叮咛最近处的基地代表，好好注意崔维兹的动向，如此而已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I see! Well, I understand now why Thoobing reacted so strenuously. I had sent him a similar warning. Since he heard from us both independently, one can scarcely blame him for thinking that the approach of a few Foundation vessels might mean a great deal more than it actually does. --How is it, Liono, you did not consult me on the matter before sending the warning?”</p><p>“我懂了！嗯，现在我才明白杜宾的反应为何如此强烈，因为我也送了一道类似的训令给他。既然他从我们两人这里分别接到指示，难怪只不过几艘基地战舰接近，他就以为会发生什么了不得的事。可是，里奥诺，你怎么事先没有跟我商量，就送出这样的训令呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell said coolly, “If I involved you in everything I do, you would have no time to be Mayor. How is it that you did not inform me of your intention?”</p><p>柯代尔泰然自若地答道：“如果我做的每件事都把你扯进去，你就没时间当市长了。可是，你又为什么不先知会我一声呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Branno said sourly, “If I informed you of all my intentions, Liono, you would know far too much. --But it is a small matter, and so is Thoobing’s alarm, and, for that matter, so is any fit that the Sayshellians throw. I am more interested in Trevize.”</p><p>布拉诺以尖酸的口气说：“如果我把每一件事都告诉你，里奥诺，你就未免知道得太多了。不过这不重要，杜宾的警告同样没什么大不了的，就连赛协尔人的大惊小怪也是小事一桩。我最关心的还是崔维兹。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Our scouts have located Compor. He is following Trevize and both are moving very cautiously toward Gaia.”</p><p>“我们的斥候舰已经发现了康普。他正在跟踪崔维兹，两艘太空艇都万分谨慎地向盖娅挺进。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I have the full reports of those scouts, Liono. Apparently both Trevize and Compor are taking Gaia seriously.”</p><p>“我有那些斥候舰的完整报告，里奥诺，崔维兹和康普显然都没把盖娅当神话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Everyone sneers at the superstitions concerning Gaia, Madam Mayor, but everyone thinks, ‘Yet what if--’ Even Ambassador Thoobing manages to be a little uneasy about it. It could be a very shrewd policy on the part of the Sayshellians. A kind of protective coloration. If one spreads stories of a mysterious and invincible world, people will shy away not only from the world, but from any other worlds close by--such as the Sayshell union.”</p><p>“大家都对有关盖娅的迷信嗤之以鼻，市长女士，不过大家也都在想：‘可是万一……’就连杜宾大使都对它有点忌惮。这可能是赛协尔人的高明策略，是他们的一种保护色。他们捏造出一个神秘而无敌的世界，并将这些故事散播出去，那么外人不但会对那个世界敬而远之，同时也会避开附近的世界，例如赛协尔联盟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You think that is why the Mule turned away from Sayshell?”</p><p>“你认为这就是骡未曾招惹赛协尔的原因？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Possibly.”</p><p>“有可能。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Surely you don’t think the Foundation has held its hand from Sayshell because of Gaia, when there is no record that we have ever heard of the world?”</p><p>“基地也从未碰过赛协尔，你不至于认为也是由于盖娅吧？没有任何记录显示，我们曾经听说那个世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I admit there’s no mention of Gaia in our archives, but neither is there any other reasonable explanation for our moderation with respect to the Sayshell union.”</p><p>“我承认我们的档案中，找不到半条有关盖娅的资料。可是我们对赛协尔联盟一向十分客气，这点也找不到合理的解释。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Let us hope, then, that the Sayshellian government, despite Thoobing’s opinion to the contrary, has convinced itself--even just a little bit--of Gaia’s might and of its deadly nature.”</p><p>“那么，希望赛协尔政府的确相信盖娅的可怕力量，即使相信一点点也好，虽然杜宾认为这是不可能的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Why so?”</p><p>“为什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Because then the Sayshell union will raise no objections to our moving toward Gaia. The more they resent that movement, the more they will persuade themselves that it should be permitted so that Gaia will swallow us. The lesson, they will imagine, will be a salutary one and will not be lost on future invaders.”</p><p>“因为这样的话，赛协尔联盟就不会反对我们接近盖娅。他们对这个行动愈是反感，就愈会确信应该袖手旁观，好让盖娅把我们吞噬。他们会想到，这将是个很好的教训，未来的侵略者都会引以为戒。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Yet what if they should be right in such a belief, Mayor? What if Gaiais deadly?”</p><p>“万一这一切都是真的呢，市长？万一盖娅真那么可怕呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Branno smiled. “You raise the ‘Yet what if--’ yourself, do you, Liono?”</p><p>布拉诺微微一笑。“你自己怎么也提出‘万一怎么样’的问题呢，里奥诺？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I must raise all possibilities, Mayor. It is my job.”</p><p>“我必须提出各种可能性，市长，这是我的职责。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“If Gaia is deadly, Trevize will be taken by them. That ishis job as my lightning rod. And so may Compor, I hope.”</p><p>“假如盖娅真那么可怕，既然崔维兹是我的避雷针，他理所当然会首当其冲。康普可能也会倒霉，而我正希望如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“You hope? Why?”</p><p>“你希望如此？为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Because it will make them overconfident, which should be useful to us. They will underestimate our power and be the easier to handle.”</p><p>“因为这样一来，盖娅便会过度自信，情势就对我们非常有利。他们会低估我们的实力，因而变得比较容易对付。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But what if it iswe who are overconfident?”</p><p>“可是，万一过度自信的是我们自己呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“We are not,” said Branno flatly.</p><p>“我们可没有。”布拉诺说得斩钉截铁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“These Gaians--whatever they are--may be something we have no concept of and cannot properly estimate the danger of. I merely suggest that, Mayor, because even that possibility should be weighed.”</p><p>“这些盖娅星人——不论他们是何方神圣——有可能是我们前所未见的敌人，因而无法准确估算危险的程度。我只是提醒你，市长，因为即使是可能性，也应该加以权衡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Indeed? Why does such a notion fall into your head, Liono?”</p><p>“是吗？你的脑袋里怎么会有这种念头呢，里奥诺？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Because I think you feel that, at the worst, Gaia is the Second Foundation. I suspect you think theyare the Second Foundation. However, Sayshell has an interesting history, even under the Empire. Sayshell alone had a measure of self-rule. Sayshell alone was spared some of the worst taxations under the so-called ‘Bad Emperors.’ In short, Sayshell seems to have had the protection of Gaia, even in Imperial times.”</p><p>“因为我觉得，你认为盖娅充其量不过是第二基地。我甚至怀疑，你认为它正是第二基地。然而，早在帝国时代，赛协尔就有一段很特殊的历史。当时，唯独赛协尔拥有相当的自治权；在某些‘坏皇帝’的统治下，唯独赛协尔能奇迹般地免除一些苛捐杂税。简言之，即使早在帝政时期，赛协尔似乎已经受到盖娅的保护。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Well then?”</p><p>“所以呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“But the Second Foundation was brought into existence by Hari Seldon at the same time our Foundation was. The Second Foundation did not exist in Imperial times--and Gaia did. Gaia, therefore, isnot the Second Foundation. It is something else--and, just possibly, something worse.”</p><p>“第二基地却是哈里·谢顿亲手创建的，是和我们这个基地同时诞生的。第二基地在帝政时期并不存在，盖娅却已经在那里。因此，盖娅绝不会是第二基地。它是另一个组织，而且还有可能，是一个更可怕的组织。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I don’t propose to be terrified by the unknown, Liono. There are only two possible sources of danger--physical weapons and mental weapons--and we are fully prepared for both. --You get back to your ship and keep the units on the Sayshellian outskirts. This ship will move toward Gaia alone, but will stay in contact with you at all times and will expect you to come to us in one Jump, if necessary. --Go, Liono, and get that perturbed look off your face.”</p><p>“我可不打算给未知的事物吓倒，里奥诺。潜在的威胁来源总共有两类：有形的武器和精神的武器，对于这两者，我们都有万全准备。回到你的战舰去，叫舰队通通守在赛协尔外围。我的这艘战舰要单独向盖娅推进，但会随时和你们保持联络，必要的时候，你们要在一跃之后就能和我们会合。去吧，里奥诺，还有，把你脸上那种愁容给我抹掉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“One last question? Are you sure you know what you’re doing?”</p><p>“最后一个问题好吗？你确定知道自己在干什么吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I do,” she said grimly. “I, too, have studied the history of Sayshell and have seen that Gaia cannot be the Second Foundation, but, as I told you, I have the full report of the scouts and from that--”</p><p>“我确定。”她绷着脸说，“我也研究过赛协尔的历史，也看出盖娅不可能是第二基地。可是，我刚才说过，我收到了斥候舰的完整报告，从这些报告中……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Well, I know where the Second Foundation is located and we will take care of both, Liono. We will take care of Gaia first and then Trantor.”</p><p>“嗯，我知道了第二基地的真正位置。我们要一举解决这两个敌人，里奥诺。我们先来收拾盖娅，然后再去收拾川陀。”</p></div>
