<div class='layout'><p>CHAPTER EIGHT FARMWOMAN</p><p>第8章 农妇</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>THE SPEAKERS SAT ABOUT THE TABLE, FROZEN IN THEIR MENTAL shielding. It was as though all-with one accord-had hidden their minds to avoid irrevocable insult to the First Speaker after his statement concerning Trevize. Surreptitiously they glanced toward Delarmi and even that gave away much. Of them all, she was best known for her irreverence -Even Gendibal paid more lip service to convention.</p><p>发言者们围坐在圆桌周围，个个都在精神屏蔽的掩护下。仿佛他们不约而同，全都将心灵隐藏起来，以免对第一发言者有关崔维兹的陈述，做出难堪的侮辱。他们唯一的举动，只是偷偷向德拉米看去，即使只是这样，也已经泄露了他们的态度。在所有的发言者中，德拉米的无礼是出了名的。就连坚迪柏，开会时偶尔也会说些应酬话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi was aware of the glances and she knew that she had no choice but to face up to this impossible situation. In fact, she did not want to duck the issue. In all the history of the Second Foundation, no First Speaker had ever been impeached for misanalysis (and behind the term, which she had invented as cover-up, was the unacknowledged incompetence). Such impeachment now became possible. She would not hang back.</p><p>德拉米注意到投向自己的目光，知道她已经没有选择的余地，只好挺身面对这个难局。事实上，她并不想逃避这个问题。在第二基地的历史上，从来没有第一发言者因为“错误分析”而遭到纠举（她故意发明这个说法当做掩饰，其实言外之意就是“无能”）。现在却有了这个可能，因此她绝不会犹豫畏缩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"First Speaker!" she said softly, her thin, colorless lips more nearly invisible than usual in the general whiteness of her face. "You yourself say you have no basis for your opinion, that the psychohistorical mathematics show nothing Do you ask us to base a crucial decision on a mystical feeling?"</p><p>“第一发言者！”她以柔和的语气说，她脸上毫无血色，苍白的薄嘴唇看来更像是隐形的。“这可是您自己亲口说的，您的意见没有任何根据，心理史学的数学未曾导出任何结果。您是要我们根据玄奥的直觉，作出一个重大无比的决策？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker looked up, his forehead corrugated. He was aware of the universal shielding at the Table. He knew what it meant. He said coldly, "I do not hide the lack of evidence. I present you with nothing falsely. What I offer is the strongly intuitive feeling of a First Speaker, one with decades of experience who has spent nearly a lifetime in the close analysis of the Seldon Plan." He looked about him with a proud rigidity he rarely displayed, and one by one the mental shields softened and dropped. Delarmi's (when he turned to stare at her) was the last.</p><p>第一发言者抬起头来，双眉紧紧锁在一起。他注意到众人都将心灵屏蔽起来，也明白这代表什么意思。他以冷静的口吻说：“我并不讳言缺乏证据，也没有提出任何伪造的结果。我向诸位报告的，是一位第一发言者强烈的直觉——这位第一发言者一生都在钻研谢顿计划，累积了数十年的经验。”他带着鲜有的孤傲神情环视众人，令他们的精神屏蔽一一软化并解除。德拉米（当他的目光转向她的时候）是最后软化的一位。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, with a disarming frankness that filled her mind as though nothing else had ever been there, "I accept your statement, of course, First Speaker. Nevertheless, I think you might perhaps want to reconsider. As you think about it now, having already expressed shame at having to fall back on intuition, would you wish your remarks to be stricken from the record if, in your judgment they should be……"</p><p>她赶紧在心中注满毫无敌意的坦然情绪，仿佛什么事都未曾发生。“第一发言者，我当然接受您的说法。然而，我想您大概愿意重新考虑一下。既然您对求助直觉这件事，已经表示羞愧之意，您会不会希望将这段发言从记录中删除。如果，根据您的判断，应该……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Gendibal's voice cut in. "What are these remarks that should. be stricken from the record?"</p><p>坚迪柏的声音突然插了进来：“什么发言该从记录中删除？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Every pair of eyes turned in unison. Had their shields not been up during the crucial moments before, they would have been aware of his approach long before he was at the door.</p><p>所有的目光几乎同时转向。若非在先前那个紧要关头，他们都将心灵屏蔽，那么早在坚迪柏进门之前，大家就该感到他已经接近。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"All shields up a moment ago? All unaware of my entrance?" said Gendibal sardonically. "What a commonplace meeting of the Table we have here. Was no one on their guard for my coming? Or did you all fully expect that I would not arrive?"</p><p>“刚才大家的心灵都封闭了？全部不知道我走进来？”坚迪柏以讽刺的口吻说，“我们这个圆桌会议，今天开的是同乐会吗，竟然没有人警觉到我的出现？还是你们全都认定我无法出席？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This outburst was a flagrant violation of all standards. For Gendibal to arrive late was bad enough. For him to then enter unannounced was worse. For him to speak before the First Speaker had acknowledged his attendance was worst of all.</p><p>这一连串的惊人之语，公然破坏了所有的规矩。迟到已经是很糟的事，未经通报闯入会场更是罪加一等，而在第一发言者准许他与会之前，坚迪柏竟然擅自发言，简直就是罪不可赦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker turned to him. All else was superceded. The question of discipline came first.</p><p>第一发言者转头望向他。其他的问题暂时都不重要了，纪律问题必须最先解决。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Speaker Gendibal," he said, "you are late. You arrive unannounced. You speak. Is there any reason why you should not be suspended from your seat for thirty days?"</p><p>“坚迪柏发言者，”他说，“你迟到了，你未经通报就进入会场，并且擅自发言。我若中止你三十天的发言权，你有任何抗辩的理由吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course. The move for suspension should not be considered until first we consider who it was that made it certain I would be late-and why." Gendibal's words were cool and measured, but his mind clothed his thoughts with anger and he did not care who sensed it.</p><p>“当然有。我们应该先来讨论，究竟是谁设法让我迟到，以及原因何在。弄明白这个问题之后，再来讨论停权处分的动议。”坚迪柏说得既冷静又谨慎，不过思绪中夹杂着怒火，他也不在乎有谁会感觉到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Certainly Delarmi sensed it. She said forcefully, "This man is mad."</p><p>德拉米当然察觉了，她高声说：“这个男人疯了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mad? This woman is mad to say so. Or aware of guilt. -First Speaker, I address myself to you and move a point of personal privilege," said Gendibal.</p><p>“疯了？这个女人这么说才疯了呢，还是因为她心虚了？第一发言者，我现在向您提出一项攸关个人权益的动议。”坚迪柏说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Personal privilege of what nature, Speaker?"</p><p>“发言者，什么样的个人权益？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"First Speaker, I accuse someone here of attempted murder."</p><p>“第一发言者，我指控在座某一位企图谋杀。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The room exploded as every Speaker rose to his or her feet in a simultaneous babble of words, expression, and mentality.</p><p>所有的发言者都跳了起来，会场响起了由语言、表情与精神状态构成的聒噪，几乎将屋顶都掀翻了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker raised his arms. He cried, "The Speaker must have his chance to express his point of personal privilege." He found himself forced to intensify his authority, mentally, in a manner most inappropriate to the place-yet there was no choice.</p><p>第一发言者举起双手，大声喝道：“我们必须给这位发言者一个机会，让他陈述他的个人权益。”他发现必须借助精神力量增强自己的威权，虽然这样做极不合宜，但也没有其他选择。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The babble quieted.</p><p>聒噪渐渐止息了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal waited unmoved until the silence was both audibly and mentally profound. He said, "On my way here, moving along a Hamish road at a distance and approaching at a speed that would have easily assured my arrival in good time for the meeting, I was stopped by several farmers and narrowly escaped being beaten, perhaps being killed. As it was, I was delayed and have but just arrived. May I point out, to begin with, that I know of no instance since the Great Sack that a Second Foundationer has been spoken to disrespectfully-let alone manhandled-by one of these Hamish people."</p><p>坚迪柏默默等待，直到会场完全恢复宁静，没有一点普通噪音或精神噪音之后，他才说：“刚才，我从阿姆人的道路走回来的时候，照我当时所在的位置，以及行进速度，都绝对不可能迟到。但我在半途被几个农夫拦住去路，差点挨了一顿揍，甚至可能被打死。由于这个缘故，我才耽搁了，直到现在才赶来。首先请容我指出，据我所知，自大浩劫之后，从来没有任何阿姆人对第二基地分子出言不逊，动粗就更不用说了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nor do I," said the First Speaker.</p><p>“我也没听说过。”第一发言者说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi cried out, "Second Foundationers do not habitually walk alone in Hamish territory! You invite this by doing so?"</p><p>德拉米突然叫道：“第二基地分子向来很少单独走到阿姆人的地盘！你偏偏这么做，这叫咎由自取！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is true," said Gendibal, "that I habitually walk alone in Hamish territory. I have walked there hundreds of times in every direction. Yet I have never been accosted before. Others do not walk with the freedom that I do, but no one exiles himself from the world or imprisons himself in the University and no one has ever been accosted. I recall occasions when Delarmi……" and then, as though remembering the honorific too late, he deliberately converted it into a deadly insult. "I mean to say, I recall when Speakeress Delarmi was in Hamish territory, at one time or another, and yet she was not accosted."</p><p>“没错，”坚迪柏说，“我经常单独走到阿姆人的地盘。每条路我都走了几百遍，可是从来没有遇上麻烦。其他人虽然不像我这样到处走，却也没有人自我放逐，把自己永远关在大学里，可是没听说有谁遭到过阻拦。我记得德拉米有时候……”此时，他好像才想起来该加上头衔，可是为时已晚，索性决定趁机羞辱她一下。“我的意思是，我记得德拉米‘女发言者’有时也会到阿姆人的地盘，可是从来没有人跟她搭讪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps," said Delarmi, with eyes widened into a glare, "because I did not speak to them first and because I maintained my distance. Because I behaved as though I deserved respect, I was accorded it."</p><p>“或许，”德拉米将眼睛瞪得跟铜铃一样大，“因为我不主动跟他们攀谈，因为我总是保持安全距离。换言之，因为我举止合宜，所以受到他们的尊敬。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Strange," said Gendibal, "and I was about to say that it was because you presented a more formidable appearance than I did. After all, few dare approach you even here. -But tell me, why should it be that of all times for interference, the Hamish would choose this day to face me, when I am to attend an important meeting of the Table?"</p><p>“怪了，”坚迪柏道，“我正想说，是因为你看起来比我可怕。毕竟，即使在我们这里，也很少有人敢接近你。可是请告诉我，过去有那么多次机会，为何阿姆人从来未曾拦阻我的去路，却偏偏选择今天，当我正赶回来参加一个重要会议的时候？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If it were not because of your behavior, then it must 'have been chance," said Delarmi. "I have not heard that even all of Seldon's mathematics has removed the role of chance from the Galaxy - certainly not in the case of individual events. Or are you, too, speaking from intuitional inspiration?" (There was a soft mental sigh from one or two Speakers at this sideways thrust at the First Speaker.)</p><p>“若非由于你举止失当，那就一定是巧合。”德拉米说，“我从来没听说过，谢顿的数学能取消几率在银河中扮演的角色，个人事件尤其如此。或者你的这番话，也是根据直觉而来的灵感？”这话旁敲侧击地攻击了第一发言者，令一两位发言者在心中轻叹一声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was not my behavior. It was not chance. It was deliberate interference," said Gendibal.</p><p>“并非我举止失当，也不是什么巧合，这是早就计划好的行动。”坚迪柏说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can we know that?" asked the First Speaker gently. He could not help but soften toward Gendibal as a result of Delarmi's last remark.</p><p>“我们又怎能确定呢？”第一发言者温和地问道。由于德拉米刚才的讽刺，他对坚迪柏的态度不免缓和许多。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My mind is open to you, First Speaker. I give you-and all the Table-my memory of events."</p><p>“我将心灵向您敞开，第一发言者。我把刚才那件事的记忆，全部传递给您，以及圆桌会议每一位成员。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The transfer took but a few moments. The First Speaker said, "Shocking! You behaved very well, Speaker, under circumstances of considerable pressure. I agree that the Hamish behavior is anomalous and warrants investigation. In the meantime, please join our meeting……"</p><p>记忆传递只花了极短暂的时间，然后第一发言者说：“真可怕！在那么大的压力下，发言者，你表现得非常有分寸。我同意那个阿姆人的行为的确反常，保证会下令调查。现在，请加入我们的讨论……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A moments" cut in Delarmi. "How certain are we that the Speaker's account is accurate?"</p><p>“且慢！”德拉米突然插嘴道，“我们如何肯定这位发言者的陈述尽皆属实？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal's nostrils flared at the insult, but he retained his level composure. "My mind is open:"</p><p>面对这样的侮辱，坚迪柏气得几乎鼻孔冒火，但他仍然勉力维持着镇静。“我的心灵是敞开的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have known open minds that were not open."</p><p>“我知道有些心灵看似敞开，其实不然。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have no doubt of that, Speaker," said Gendibal, "since you, like the rest of us, must keep your own mind under inspection at all times. My mind, when open, however, is open."</p><p>“这点我倒并不怀疑，发言者，”坚迪柏说，“因为你跟大家一样，一定随时随地检视自己的心灵。然而我跟你不同，当我打开心灵，它就完全敞开。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "Let us have no further……"</p><p>第一发言者说：“我们不要再……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A point of personal privilege, First Speaker, with apologies for the interruption," said Delarmi.</p><p>“我也要提出一项有关个人权益的动议，第一发言者，同时我要向您道歉，请原谅我刚才打岔。”德拉米说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Personal privilege of what nature, Speaker?"</p><p>“发言者，什么样的个人权益？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Speaker Gendibal has accused one of us of attempted murder, presumably by instigating the farmer to attack him. As long as the accusation is not withdrawn, I must be viewed as a possible murderer, as would every person in this room-including you, First Speaker."</p><p>“坚迪柏发言者指控我们其中一人企图谋杀，教唆那个农夫攻击他。在这项指控尚未撤回之前，我必须被视为凶嫌，在座每一位也都一样。包括您在内，第一发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "Would you withdraw the accusation, Speaker Gendibal?"</p><p>第一发言者说：“你愿意撤回这项指控吗，坚迪柏发言者？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal took his seat and put his hands down upon its arms, gripping them tightly, as though taking ownership of it, and said, "I will do so, as soon as someone explains why a Hamish farmer, rallying several others, should deliberately set out to delay me on my way to this meeting."</p><p>坚迪柏坐到自己的座位上，两手紧紧抓住扶手，仿佛要将座椅据为己有。他说：“我愿意，可是得有人先解释一下，在我赶来参加会议的时候，为什么会有一个阿姆农夫，伙同其他几个同伴，竟然故意要拦阻我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A thousand reasons, perhaps," said the First Speaker. "I repeat that this event will be investigated. Will you, for now, Speaker Gendibal, and in the interest of continuing the present discussion, withdraw your accusation?"</p><p>“这也许有上千个原因，”第一发言者说，“我重申一遍，这件事一定会详加调查。现在，坚迪柏发言者，为了讨论得以继续进行，可否请你撤回指控？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I cannot, First Speaker. I spent long minutes trying, as delicately as I might, to search his mind for ways to alter his behavior without damage and failed. His mind lacked the give it should have had. His emotions were fixed, as though by an outside mind."</p><p>“不行，第一发言者。刚才，我花了好几分钟时间，尽可能以最精妙的手法探索对方的心灵，设法转变他的行为，又不至于造成伤害，结果我失败了。他的心灵缺乏应有的弹性，他的情绪全被定型，仿佛受到外在心灵的控制。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi said with a sudden little smile, "And you think one of us was the outside mind? Might it not have been your mysterious organization that is competing with us, that is more powerful than we are?"</p><p>德拉米突然挤出一丝笑意，接口道：“而你认为那个外在心灵，正是我们其中之一？难道就不会是你所谓的神秘组织，那个和我们对立、比我们更强大的组织干的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It might," said GendibaI.</p><p>“有这个可能。”坚迪柏说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, we-who are not members of this organization that only you know of-are not guilty and you should withdraw your accusation. Or can it be that you are accusing someone here of being under the control of this strange organization? Perhaps one of us here is not quite what he or she seems?"</p><p>“这样的话，我们这些人都是清白的，因为我们都不属于那个只有你才知道的组织，所以你应该立刻撤回指控。难道说，你是想指控在座某个人，受到了那个神秘组织的控制？也许我们其中某一位成员，已经不完全是他自己了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps," said Gendibal stolidly, quite aware that Delarmi was feeding him rope with a noose at the end of it.</p><p>“或许吧。”坚迪柏冷冷地答道，他很清楚德拉米正在把他引进一个圈套。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It might seem," said Delarmi, reaching the noose and preparing to tighten it, "that your dream of a secret, unknown, hidden, mysterious organization is a nightmare of paranoia. It would ft in with your paranoid fantasy that Hamish farmers are being influenced, that Speakers are under hidden control. I am willing, however, to follow this peculiar thought line of yours for a while longer. Which of us here, Speaker, do you think is under control? Might it be me?"</p><p>“不过也有可能，”德拉米准备开始收紧圈套，“你所幻想的这个既秘密又隐密的神秘组织，只是一个妄想症患者的恶梦。根据你的被迫害妄想，阿姆农夫们受到影响，发言者也都受到秘密控制。然而，我愿意暂且迁就你的奇特思路。发言者，你认为我们中间，哪一个人受到控制？会不会就是本人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "I would not think so, Speaker. If you were attempting to rid yourself of me in so indirect a manner, you would not so openly advertise your dislike for me."</p><p>坚迪柏回答说：“我倒不这么想，发言者。你若试图用这么迂回的方式铲除我，就不会如此公然对我表示憎恶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A double-double-cross, perhaps?" said Delarmi. She was virtually purring. "That would be a common conclusion in a paranoid fantasy."</p><p>“也许是负负得正的结果吧？”德拉米柔声说，口气得意之至，“妄想症患者很容易得出这种结论。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So it might be. You are more experienced in such matters than I.""</p><p>“既然你这么说，那就有此可能。你的妄想经验比我丰富多了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Speaker Lestim Gianni interrupted hotly. "See here, Speaker Gendibal, if you are exonerating Speaker Delarmi, you are directing your accusations the more tightly at the rest of us. What grounds would any of us have to delay your presence at this meeting, let alone wish you dead?"</p><p>另一名发言者列斯提姆·吉安尼，突然怒声插嘴道：“听好，坚迪柏发言者，如果你洗刷了德拉米发言者的嫌疑，就等于指控我们其他人嫌疑更重。我们其中无论哪一个，又有什么理由要阻延你参加会议，更遑论要置你于死地？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal answered quickly, as though he had been waiting for the question. "When I entered, the point under discussion was the striking of remarks from the record, remarks made by the First Speaker. I was the only Speaker not in a position to hear those remarks. Let me know what they were and I rather think I will tell you the motive for delaying me."</p><p>坚迪柏好像就是在等这个问题，他立刻答道：“我刚才进来的时候，你们正在讨论将某些发言从记录中删除。那是第一发言者的发言，而我是唯一未能听到的发言者。请让我知道它的内容，相信我就能找出某人阻延我的动机。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "I had stated-and it was something to which Speaker Delarmi and others took serious exception-that I had decided, on the basis of intuition and of a most inappropriate use of psychohistorical mathematics, that the entire future of the Plan may rest on the exile of First Foundationer Golan Trevize:"</p><p>第一发言者说：“我刚才在陈述——结果德拉米发言者和其他人都表示强烈反对——我根据直觉以及心理史学的不当应用，断定谢顿计划未来的成败，全系于遭到放逐的第一基地人葛兰·崔维兹身上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "What other Speakers may think is up to them. For my part, I agree with this hypothesis. Trevize is the key. I find his sudden ejection by the First Foundation too curious to be innocent."</p><p>坚迪柏说：“其他发言者怎么想，那是他们的事。就我自己而言，我完全同意这个假设。崔维兹是关键所在，他突然被第一基地放逐到太空，我认为内幕绝不单纯。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi said, "Would you care to say, Speaker Gendibal, that Trevize is in the grip of this mystery organization-or that the people who exiled him are? Is perhaps everyone and everything in their control except you and the First Speaker-and me, whom you have declared to be uncontrolled?"</p><p>德拉米说：“坚迪柏发言者，你是不是想讲，崔维兹——或是放逐他的那些人——已在那个神秘组织的掌握中？也许每一个人和每一件事都受到了他们的控制，只有你、第一发言者，还有我是例外，因为你已经宣称我并未受到控制。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "These ravings require no answer. Instead let me ask if there is any Speaker here who would like to express agreement on this matter with the First Speaker and myself? You have read, I presume, the mathematical treatment that I have, with the First Speaker's approval, circulated among you."</p><p>坚迪柏答道：“这些疯言疯语我根本不必回答。接下来我想要问的是，在座的发言者当中，有谁愿意对第一发言者和我的观点表示赞同？我经过第一发言者的许可，分发给各位的那些数学推导，想必各位已经看过了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was silence.</p><p>接下来是一片死寂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I repeat my request," said Gendibal. "Anyone?"</p><p>“我再重复一遍我的问题，”坚迪柏说，“有谁赞同？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was silence.</p><p>仍是一片死寂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "First Speaker, you now have the motive for delaying me."</p><p>坚迪柏说：“第一发言者，现在您该知道阻延我的动机了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "State it explicitly."</p><p>第一发言者说：“请明讲。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have expressed the need to deal with Trevize, with this First Foundationer. It represents an important initiative in policy and if the Speakers had read my treatment, they would have known in a general way what was in the wind. If, nevertheless, they had unanimously disagreed with you-unanimously-then, by traditional self-limitation, you would have been unable to go forward. If even one Speaker backed you, then you would be able to implement this new policy. I was the one Speaker who would back yon, as anyone who had read my treatment would know, and it was necessary that I must, at all costs, be kept from the Table. That trick proved nearly successful, but I am now here and I back the First Speaker. I agree with him and he can, in accordance with tradition, disregard the disagreement of the ten other Speakers."</p><p>“您曾经表示过，我们需要对那个第一基地人崔维兹，采取因应对策。这就代表我们务必采取积极主动。诸位发言者若看过我的报告，就该对我的想法至少有个概念。然而，假使全体发言者一致反对您——全体一致反对，那么，根据固有的权限，您就无法作出任何改变。可是只要有一位发言者支持您，您就能够施行新的政策。而我就是那位会支持您的发言者，任何人只要读过我的报告，都可以了解这一点。因此，必须不计任何代价阻止我出席圆桌会议。这个诡计几乎得逞，但我现在还是赶来了，而我表明支持第一发言者的立场。既然我赞同他的观点，那么根据固有的惯例，他就能对其他十位发言者的反对置之不理。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi struck the table with her fist. "The implication is that someone knew in advance what the First Speaker would advise, knew in advance that Speaker Gendibal would support it and that all the rest would not-that someone knew what he could not have known. There is the further implication that this initiative is not to the liking of Speaker Gendibal's paranoia-inspired organization and that they are fighting to prevent it and that, therefore, one or more of us is under the control of that organization:"</p><p>德拉米使劲敲了一下会议桌。“这就代表，某人事先知道第一发言者准备讨论的内容，并且事先知道坚迪柏发言者会支持这个提案，而其他人全部会反对。换句话说，这个人能获悉他不可能知晓的事。我们还可以进一步推论，这个先发制人的计划，是坚迪柏发言者妄想出的那个组织所不喜欢的，因此他们才会出面阻挠，而且我们当中的一位或几位，已经在那个组织控制之下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The implication is there," agreed Gendibal. "Your analysis is masterly."</p><p>“这些推论都很正确。”坚迪柏表示同意，“你的分析实在极为精辟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whom do you accuse?" cried out Delarmi.</p><p>“你指控的到底是谁？”德拉米大声叫道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No one. I call upon the First Speaker to take up the matter. It is clear that there is someone in our organization who is working against us. I suggest that everyone working for the Second Foundation should undergo a thorough mental analysis. Everyone, including the Speakers themselves. Even including myself-and the First Speaker."</p><p>“我不想指控谁，这件事我想请第一发言者处理。现在事态已经很明显，我们当中的确有人暗中和我们为敌。我在此提出一项建议，每一个为第二基地工作的人，都接受一次彻底的精神结构分析。每一个人，包括所有的发言者，甚至包括我自己和第一发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The meeting of the Table broke up in greater confusion and greater excitement than any on record.</p><p>圆桌会议的秩序立时失控，出现了史无前例的混乱场面与激动情绪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And when the First Speaker finally spoke the phrase of adjournment, Gendibal-without speaking to anyone-made his way back to his room. He knew well that he had not one friend among the Speakers, that even whatever support the First Speaker could give him would be half-hearted at best.</p><p>等到第一发言者终于正式宣布休会，坚迪柏没有跟任何人打招呼，径自回到自己的房间。他心中很明白，其他发言者都不是他的朋友，就连第一发言者所能提供的支持，也顶多算是半推半就。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He could not tell whether he feared for himself or for the entire Second Foundation. The taste of doom was sour in his mouth.</p><p>他自己也无法分辨，他究竟是为自己担心，还是在忧虑整个第二基地的安危。末日即将降临的感觉，令他满嘴苦涩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal did not sleep well. His waking thoughts and his sleeping dreams were alike engaged in quarreling with Delora Delarmi. In one passage of one dream, there was even a confusion between her and the Hamish farmer, Rufirant, so that Gendibal found himself facing an out-of-proportion Delarmi advancing upon him with enormous fists and a sweet smile that revealed needlelike teeth.</p><p>当天晚上，坚迪柏睡得很不好。不论在清醒的思绪中，或是睡眠的梦境里，他都跟德拉米争吵不休。在某个梦境中，她竟然和那个阿姆农夫鲁菲南融成一体，于是，坚迪柏眼前出现一个比例怪异的德拉米，一步步向他逼近。她抡着两个巨大的拳头，脸上带着甜美的微笑，还露出许多细长的尖牙。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He finally woke, later than usual, with no sensation of having rested and with the buzzer on his night table in muted action. He turned over to bring his hand down upon the contact.</p><p>直到床头柜上的蜂鸣器发出微弱的声音，他才总算醒了过来。现在早已过了他平日的起床时间，他却一点也没有歇息过的感觉。他赶紧转过身来，按下对讲机的键钮。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes? What is it?"</p><p>“喂？什么事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Speaker!" The voice was that of the floor proctor, rather less than suitably respectful. "A visitor wishes to speak to you:"</p><p>“发言者！”说话的是那层楼的舍监，语气中欠缺应有的尊重。“有个访客希望见你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A visitor?" Gendibal punched his appointment schedule and the screen showed nothing before noon. He pushed the time button; it was 8:3i A.m. He said peevishly, "Who in space and time is it?"</p><p>“访客？”坚迪柏按了按行事历的开关，屏幕显示中午以前并无任何约会。他再按下时间显示键，现在是上午八点三十二分。他没好气地问道：“究竟是什么人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Will not give a name, Speaker." Then, with clear disapproval, "One of these Hamishers, Speaker. Arrived at your invitation." The last sentence was said with even clearer disapproval.</p><p>“发言者，那人不愿通报姓名。”然后，舍监用明显不以为然的口气说：“是个阿姆人，发言者，说是应你之邀来的。”最后半句话的口气更加不以为然。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Let him wait in the reception room till I come down. It will take time."</p><p>“让他到会客室等我，我还要一阵子才能下来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal did not hurry. Throughout the morning ablutions, he remained lost in thought. That someone was using the Hamish to hamper his movements made sense-but he would like to know who that someone was. And what was this new intrusion of the Hamish into his very quarters? A complicated trap of some sort?</p><p>坚迪柏一点也不急。沐浴的时候，他一直陷入沉思。有人利用阿姆人来阻挠他的行动，这个假设愈想愈合理，但他更想知道究竟是何方神圣。现在这个登堂入室来找他的阿姆人又是谁？这是另一个精心布置的陷阱吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How in the name of Seldon would a Hamish farmer get into the University? What reason could he advance? What reason could he really have?</p><p>谢顿在上，一个阿姆农夫到大学来做什么？他能有什么借口？真正的来意又是什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For one fleeting moment, Gendibal wondered if he ought to arm himself. He decided against it almost at once, since he felt contemptuously certain of being able to control any single farmer on the University grounds without any danger to himself-and without any unacceptable marking of a Hamish mind.</p><p>有那么一瞬间，坚迪柏想到是否应该携械防身。但他几乎立刻打消这个念头，因为他充满高傲的自信，确定自己在大学校园中不会有任何危险。在这里，他能轻而易举控制任何一个农夫，却不会在阿姆人心灵中留下过深的痕迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal decided he had been too strongly affected by the incident with Karoll Rufirant the day before. -Was it the very farmer, by the way? No longer under the influence, perhaps-of whatever or whoever it washe might well have come to Gendibal to apologize for what he had done and with apprehension of punishment. -But how would Rufirant know where to go? Whom to approach?</p><p>坚迪柏判断，一定是由于昨天卡洛耳·鲁菲南带来的麻烦，令他受到强烈的震撼，才会变得这般疑神疑鬼。对了，会不会就是那个农夫呢？或许他已不再受到干扰——不论是什么人或什么组织的干扰——他当然会担心受到惩罚，因而主动前来道歉。可是鲁菲南怎么知道该到这里来？又怎么会找到自己呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal swung down the corridor resolutely and entered the waiting room. He stopped in astonishment, then fumed to the proctor, who was pretending to be busy in his glass-walled cubicle.</p><p>坚迪柏大摇大摆走过回廊，打定主意兵来将挡。他刚踏进会客室，立刻大吃一惊，连忙转身去找那名舍监。后者坐在玻璃围成的隔间中，正在假装埋头办公。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Proctor, you did not say the visitor was a woman."</p><p>“舍监，你没说访客是个女的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The proctor said quietly, "Speaker, I said a Hamisher. You did not ask further."</p><p>舍监沉着地回答说：“发言者，我说是个阿姆人，你就没有再问下去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Minimal information, Proctor? I must remember that as one of your characteristics." (And he must check to see if the proctor was a Delarmi appointee. And he must remember, from now on, to note the functionaries who surrounded him, "Lowlies" whom it was too easy to ignore from the height of his still-new Speakership.) "Are any of the conference rooms available?"</p><p>“问一句答一句是吗，舍监？我得记住这是你的特点。”此外，还得查一查他是不是德拉米的眼线。而且从现在开始，必须记得注意身边每一名工作人员。这些“低层人员”很容易被他这种人忽视，虽然他才刚刚升任发言者不久。“哪一间会议室空着？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The proctor said, "Number 4 is the only one available, Speaker. It will be free for three hours." He glanced briefly at the Hamishwoman, then at Gendibal, with blank innocence.</p><p>舍监答道：“只有四号会议室空着，发言者，有三小时的空档。”他装着一副老实的模样，瞥了瞥那个阿姆女子，又瞥了瞥坚迪柏。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We will use Number 4, Proctor, and I would advise you to mind your thoughts." Gendibal struck, not gently, and the proctor's shield closed far too slowly. Gendibal knew well it was beneath his dignity to manhandle a lesser mind, but a person who was incapable of shielding an unpleasant conjecture against a superior ought to learn not to indulge in one. The proctor would have a mild headache for a few hours. It was well deserved.</p><p>“那我们就用四号会议室，舍监，我还要劝你一句话，别多管他人的心灵。”坚迪柏投射出并不算弱的精神力量，舍监根本来不及防御。如此对付一个弱势的心灵，实在有损身份，这点坚迪柏很明白。可是像他这种人，既然无法掩饰心中的下流揣测，就不该一直乐此不疲。舍监至少要头疼好几个小时，那是他罪有应得。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her name did not spring immediately to mind and Gendibal was in no mood to delve deeper. She could scarcely expect him to remember, in any case.</p><p>坚迪柏并未立刻想起她的名字，也没有心情费神去想。无论如何，她也不可能指望他记得。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said peevishly, "You are……"</p><p>他没好气地说：“你是……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I be Novi, Master Scowler," she said in what was almost a gasp. "My previous be Sura, but I be called Novi plain."</p><p>“我系诺微，邪者师傅。”她几乎是喘着气说出这句话的，“我的名系苏拉，但我只用诺微称呼。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Novi. We met yesterday; I remember now. I have not forgotten that you came to my defense." He could not bring himself to use the Hamish accent on the very University grounds. "Now how did you get here?"</p><p>“对了，诺微，我们昨天见过面，现在我记起来了。我没有忘记你跳出来保护我。”在大学校园中，他实在无法改用阿姆腔调说话，“你是怎么找到这里来的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Master, you said I might write letter. You said, it should say, `Speaker's House, Apartment 27-' I self-bring it and I show the writing - my own writing, Master." She said it with a kind of bashful pride. "They ask, `For whom be this writing?' I heared your calling when you said it to that oafish bane-top, Rufirant. I say it be for Stor Gendibal, Master Scowler."</p><p>“师傅，你说我可写信给你。你说要写‘发言者之家，第二十七栋’。我自己送信来，我拿给他们看。系我自己写的，师傅。”她流露出掺杂着害羞的骄傲，“他们问：‘写这信给谁？’邪者师傅，你对那笨头鲁菲南说话的时候，我听到你讲自己的姓名，所以我说系送给史陀·坚迪柏。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And they let you pass, Novi? Didn't they ask to see the letter?"</p><p>“他们就这样让你进来，诺微？他们没有要求看那封信吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I be very frightened. I think maybe they feel gentle-sorry. I said, `Scowler Gendibal promise to show me Place of Scowlers,' and they smile. One of them at gate-door say to other, `And that not all he be show her.' And they show me where to go, and say not to go elseplace at all or I be thrown out moment-wise."</p><p>“我非常惊吓，我想也许他们感受轻微抱歉。我说：‘坚迪柏邪者答应带我参观邪者之地。’他们都笑起来，大门口一个人对另一个人说：‘他还会带她参观别的。’他们指出我该哪里走，说不可走到别的他处，否则一下子把我赶出去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal reddened faintly. By Seldon, if he felt the need for Hamish amusement, it would not be in so open a fashion and his choice would have been made more selectively. He looked at the Trantorian woman with an inward shake of his head.</p><p>坚迪柏的双颊泛红。谢顿在上，他若需要找阿姆女子寻欢作乐，绝不会如此明目张胆，也不会这么饥不择食。他再看了这个阿姆女子一眼，不禁在心中暗自摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She seemed quite young, younger perhaps than hard work had made her appear. She could not be more than twenty-five, at which age Hamishwomen were usually already married. She wore her dark hair in the braids that signified her to be unmarried-virginal, in fact-and he was not surprised. Her performance yesterday showed her to have enormous talent as a shrew and he doubted that a Hamishman could easily be found who would dare be yoked to her tongue and her ready fist. Nor was her appearance much of an attraction. Though she had gone to pains to make herself look presentable, her face was angular and plain, her hands red and knobby. What he could see of her figure seemed built for endurance rather than for grace.</p><p>她似乎相当年轻，也许风吹日晒使她看来比实际年龄还大。反正她不会超过二十五岁，这种年龄的阿姆女子通常已经嫁人。而她将黑发扎成辫子，这就代表她依然未婚，而且还是处女，这点他倒并不惊讶。从她昨天的表现，看得出她有当泼妇的足够本钱。坚迪柏甚至怀疑，是否有任何阿姆男子，胆敢消受她的伶牙俐齿再加上重拳。她的外表也不吸引人，虽然她已经费尽心血装扮，脸蛋看来仍旧瘦削而平庸，双手则是又红又肿，骨节粗大。她的身材天生就是吃苦耐劳型，没有半分婀娜多姿的美感。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her lower lip began to tremble under his scrutiny. He could sense her embarrassment and fright quite plainly and felt pity. She had, indeed, been of use to him yesterday and that was what counted.</p><p>在他仔细的打量下，她的下唇开始微微发颤。他能清楚地感知她的尴尬与恐惧，同情心油然而生。昨天她的确帮了大忙，他可不能知恩不报。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, in an attempt to be genial and soothing, "So you have come to see the-uh-Place of Scholars?"</p><p>坚迪柏试着用温和的话语抚慰她，他说：“所以你是来参观……喔……学者之地？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She opened her dark eyes wide (they were rather fine) and said, "Master, be not ired with me, but I come to be scowler own-self."</p><p>她将眼睛睁得老大（那双黑眼珠倒满秀气），回答说：“师傅，别生我的怒气，但我来系自己要做邪者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You want to be a scholar?" Gendibal was thunderstruck. "My good woman……"</p><p>“你想做一个学者？”坚迪柏感到这句话像晴天霹雳，“我的好姑娘……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paused. How on Trantor could one explain to a completely unsophisticated farmwoman the level of intelligence, training, and mental stamina required to be what Trantorians called a "scowler"?</p><p>他说不下去了。她只是个完全不通世故的农妇，自己究竟该如何向她解释，想要成为阿姆人口中的“邪者”，必须具备怎样的智慧与精神耐力，还必须接受多少训练。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Sura Novi drove on fiercely. "I be a writer and a reader. I have read whole books to end and from beginning, too. And I have wish to be scowler. I do not wish to be farmer's wife. I be no person for farm. I will not wed farmer or have farmer children." She lifted her head and said proudly, "I be asked. Many times. I always say, 'Nay! Politely, but 'Nay."'</p><p>可是苏拉·诺微却拼命强调：“我会写字，也会读书。我读完好些书本，都是从尾读到头。我永远希望做邪者，我不希望做农夫老婆，我不系该待在农场的人。我不会嫁农夫，生下许多农夫娃娃。”她突然抬起头，骄傲地说，“我被人求婚，有很多次，我总说‘不要’。我系客气地说，但不要就不要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal could see plainly enough that she was lying. She had not been asked, but he kept his face straight. He said, "What will you do with your life if you do not marry?"</p><p>坚迪柏一眼就能看出她在骗人，根本没有人向她求过婚。可是他装着一副严肃的表情，对她说：“如果你不结婚，你这辈子想做什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi brought her hand down on the table, palm flat. "I will be scowler. I not be farmwoman."</p><p>诺微伸出一只手来按在桌上。“我要做邪者，我不做农妇。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What if I cannot make you a scholar?"</p><p>“万一我不能使你成为学者呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then I be nothing and I wait to die. I be nothing in life if I be not a scowler."</p><p>“那我什么都不做，我就等死。若我不做邪者，我这辈子没有意义。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a moment there was the impulse to search her mind and find out the extent of her motivation. But it would be wrong to do so. A Speaker did not amuse one's self by rummaging through the helpless minds of others. There was a code to the science and technique of mental control-mentalics-as to other professions. Or there should be. (He was suddenly regretful he had struck out at the proctor.)</p><p>坚迪柏突然有一个冲动，想要探索她的心灵，弄清楚她的动机究竟有多强。可是这样做是不对的，身为一名发言者，不能为了满足自己的好奇心，就随便进入他人毫无抵抗力的心灵，在里头肆意翻找答案。与其他各行各业一样，精神控制这门科技——所谓的精神力学——也自有一套规范，至少各人心中都有一把尺。他忽然对攻击舍监的举动感到后悔。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "Why not be a farmwoman, Novi?" With a little manipulation, he could make her content with that and manipulate some Hamish lout into being happy to marry her-and she to marry him. It would do no harm. It would be a kindness. -But it was against the law and thus unthinkable.</p><p>他又说：“为什么不愿意做个农妇呢，诺微？”他只需要动一点手脚，就能使她对这个命运心满意足，然后再影响一个阿姆乡巴佬，让他乐意把她娶回家，并且让她死心塌地跟着他。这样做不会有任何害处，而且是一种善举。但这是违反法律的行为，因此连想都不该想。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, "I not be. A farmer is a clod. He works with earthlumps, and he becomes earth-lump. If I be farmwoman, I be earthlump, too. I will be timeless to read and write, and I will forget. My head," she put her hand to her temple, "will grow sour and stale. No! A scowler be different. Thoughtful!" (She meant by the word, Gendibal noted, "intelligent" rather than "considerate.")</p><p>她回答说：“我不做。农夫系大老粗，每日在泥巴里打滚，自己也变成一团泥巴。若我做农妇，我也变成一团泥巴。我会失去时间读书写字，我会遗忘。我的脑袋，”她伸出手来指着太阳穴，“会变馊和腐坏。不！邪者系不一样的人，系有心人！”坚迪柏明白，她其实是指“聪明人”，而不是“思虑周到的人”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A scowler," she said, "live with books and with-with-I forget what they be name-said." She made a gesture as though she were making some sort of vague manipulations that would have meant nothing to Gendibal-if he did not have her mind radiations to guide him.</p><p>“邪者身边全系书本，”她继续说，“还有……还有……我忘掉它称什么名字。”她比划了一个动作，有点像在操作什么仪器。若是没有接收到她的精神辐射，坚迪柏根本猜不出她的意思。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Microfilms," he said. "How do you know about microfilms?"</p><p>“微缩胶卷。”他说，“你怎么听说过微缩胶卷？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In books, I read of many things," she said proudly.</p><p>“从书本里头，我读到许多东西。”她得意地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal could no longer fight off the desire to know more. This was an unusual Hamisher; he had never heard of one like this. The Hamish were never recruited, but if Novi were younger, say ten years old</p><p>坚迪柏再也按捺不住好奇心。这是一个不寻常的阿姆女子，他从未听说过有人像她这样。第二基地一向不吸收阿姆人，可是诺微若再年轻一点，比如说只有十岁……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What a waste? He would not disturb her; he would not disturb her in the least, but of what use was it to be a Speaker if one could not observe unusual minds and learn from them?</p><p>真可惜！他不愿骚扰她，绝对不愿意。可是，如果不能观察一个不寻常的心灵，从中学到更多的精神力学知识，又怎么配做一名发言者？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "Novi, I want you to sit there for a moment. Be very quiet. Do not say anything. Do not think of saying anything. just think of falling asleep: Do you understand?"</p><p>于是他说：“诺微，我要你在这里坐一会儿。心情尽量放平静，一句话也别说，也别想要说什么。只要想着睡着了，你懂吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her fright returned at once, "Why must ' do this, Master?"</p><p>她的恐惧感立刻复发。“为何要我这样做，师傅？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because I wish to think how you might become a scholar."</p><p>“因为我想考虑一下，怎样才能使你成为学者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After all, no matter what she had read, there was no possible way in which she could know what being a "scholar" truly meant. It was therefore necessary to find out what she thought a scholar was.</p><p>毕竟，无论看过多少书，她终究不可能了解身为“学者”的真正意义。因此有必要了解一下，她心目中的学者到底是什么样子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Very carefully and with infinite delicacy he probed her mind; sensing without actually touching-like placing one's hand on a polished metal surface without leaving fingerprints. To her a scholar was someone who always read books. She had not the slightest idea of why one read books. For herself to be a scholar-the picture in her mind was that of doing the labor she knew-fetching, carrying, cooking, cleaning, following orders - but on the University grounds where books were available and where she would have time to read them and, very vaguely, "to become learned." What it amounted to was that she wanted to be a servant-his servant.</p><p>他开始探入她的心灵，手法无比精妙又极度谨慎，并没有真正接触，却能感知其中的内容。就像将手掌放在光滑的金属表面，而不留下任何指纹。结果他发现，她以为学者就是永远在读书的人，至于为什么读书，她却连丝毫概念都没有。对于她自己成为学者这件事，她心中的图像是继续日常的工作，煮饭、洗衣、擦地、搬运东西、听从吩咐。只不过是换成在大学里干活，因此可以接触许多书籍，而她也能有闲暇读书，然后就能“变得有学问”，但那只是非常模糊的念头。将这些想法加在一起，等于她想在这里做个仆人——他自己的仆人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal frowned. A Hamishwoman servant-and one who was plain, graceless, uneducated, barely literate. Unthinkable.</p><p>坚迪柏不禁皱起眉头。一名阿姆女仆——平庸、粗俗、无知、几近文盲——简直难以想象。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He would simply have to divert her. There would have to be some way of adjusting her desires to make her content to be a farmwoman, some way that would leave no mark, some way about which even Delarmi could not complain.</p><p>他只需要改变她的想法就行了。一定有办法能调整她的欲望，让她心甘情愿当个农妇。这必须做得不着痕迹，要让德拉米也无从挑剔。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>-Or had she been sent by Delarmi? Was all this a complicated plan to lure him into tampering with a Hamish mind, so that he might be caught and impeached?</p><p>或者她正是德拉米派来的？这会不会是个精心策划的阴谋，目的是引诱自己去干扰一个阿姆心灵，然后就被抓个正着并遭到纠举？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Ridiculous. He was in danger of growing paranoid. Somewhere in the simple tendrils of her uncomplicated mind, a trickle of mental current needed to be diverted. It would only take a tiny push.</p><p>荒唐，他果真出现了妄想症的迹象。在她单纯心灵的某个角落，精神细流需要稍加转向。只要轻轻推一下就行了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was against the letter of the law, but it would do no harm and no one would ever notice.</p><p>这样做是违反法律的，但是，不会有什么害处，也不会有任何人注意到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He paused.</p><p>他陡然停下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Back. BBBBBBBBBB.</p><p>向后退，向后退，向后退。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Space! He had almost missed it!</p><p>太空啊！他差一点就没注意到！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was he the victim of an illusion?</p><p>难道自己真的产生了幻觉？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No! Now that his attention was drawn. to it, he could make it out clearly. There was the tiniest tendril disarrayed-an abnormal disarray. Yet it was so delicate, so ramification-free.</p><p>不可能！现在他的注意力集中在那里，他能辨识得清清楚楚。有一根最细微的精神纤维显得凌乱——一种不正常的乱象，可是又过分细致，几乎没有分歧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal emerged from .her mind. He said gently, "Novi."</p><p>坚迪柏赶紧钻出她的心灵，轻声说：“诺微。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her eyes focused. She said, "Yes, Master?"</p><p>她的目光重新聚焦。“什么事，师傅？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "You may work with me. I will make you a scholar……"</p><p>坚迪柏说：“你可以在我手下工作，我会让你成为一名学者……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Joyfully, eyes blazing, she said, "Master……"</p><p>她眼睛一亮，兴奋地叫道：“师傅……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He detected it at once. She was going to throw herself at his feet. He put his hands on her shoulders and held her tightly. "Don't move, Novi. Stay where you are. -Stay!"</p><p>他随即察觉她要跪在自己脚下，连忙伸出双手，使劲抓住她的肩膀。“别动，诺微。待在原处，不要动！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He might have been talking to a half-trained animal. When he could see the order had penetrated, he let her go. He was conscious of the hard muscles along her upper arms.</p><p>他好像在跟一只稍微受过训练的动物讲话。直到看出命令贯穿她的心灵，他才松开手。刚才抓着她的时候，他感觉到她的上臂肌肉好结实。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "If you are to be a scholar, you must behave like one. That means you will have to be always quiet, always soft-spoken, always doing what I tell you to do. And you must try to learn to talk as I do. You will also have to meet other scholars. Will you be afraid?"</p><p>他说：“假如你想成为学者，就要表现得有学者的模样。这就代表说，你随时要保持肃静，随时要轻声细语，随时要听从我的指导。此外，你必须试着学习我的说话方式，还得和其他的学者接触。你会害怕吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I be not afeared - afraid, Master, if you be with me:"</p><p>“我不会惊吓——不会害怕的，师傅，只要你跟我一起。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I wilt be with you. But now, first- I must find you a room, arrange to have you assigned a lavatory, a place in the dining room, and clothes, too. You will have to wear clothes more suitable to a scholar, Novi."</p><p>“我会跟你在一起的。不过，我得先为你找一个房间，替你安排盥洗室、餐厅座位和适当的衣着。你必须穿得像个学者才行，诺微。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"These be all I……" she began miserably.</p><p>“这些系我全部……”她的口气突然变得哀伤。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>" "We will supply others."</p><p>“我们会帮你找些合适的衣服。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Clearly he would have to get a woman to arrange for a new supply of clothing for Novi. He would also need someone to teach the Hamisher the rudiments of personal hygiene. After ail, though the clothes she wore were probably her best and though she had obviously spruced herself up, she still had a distinct odor that was faintly unpleasant.</p><p>坚迪柏知道必须找个妇人帮忙，请她替诺微准备一些衣物。他还得再找一个人，教导这个阿姆女子基本卫生习惯。毕竟，她现在穿的衣服可能是她最好的行头，而且她显然刻意梳洗过，但她身上仍旧有一股异味，闻起来有些不舒服。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And he would have to make sure that the relationship between them was understood. It was always an open secret that the men (and women, too) of the Second Foundation made occasional forays among the Hamish for their pleasure. If there was no interference with Hamish minds in the process, no one dreamed of making a fuss about it. Gendibal himself had never indulged in this, and he liked to think it was because he felt no need for sex that might be coarser and more highly spiced than was available at the University. The women of the Second Foundation might be pallid in comparison to the Hamish, but they were clean and their skins were smooth.</p><p>除此之外，他还得跟她划清界线，不能让人产生误会。第二基地的男人（女人也如是），有些偶尔会出去找阿姆人寻欢作乐，这已经是公开的秘密。只要从头到尾没有干扰阿姆人的心灵，绝不会有人对这种事大惊小怪。坚迪柏自己从来不喜欢这样做，他认为校园中的男女关系就能满足自己，所以不必再去寻找或许更狂野、更有味的性爱。跟阿姆女子比较起来，第二基地的女性显得苍白瘦弱，可是她们个个都很干净，而且皮肤光滑细嫩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But even if the matter were misunderstood and there were sniggers at a Speaker who net only turned to the Hamish but brought one into his quarters, he would have to endure the embarrassment. As it stood, this farmwoman, Sura Novi, was his key to victory in the inevitable forthcoming duel with Speaker Delarmi and the rest of the Table.</p><p>不过即使引起误会，让人暗笑他这个发言者做得太过分，不但爱打野食，还把一个阿姆女子带到自己的房间来，他也必须忍受这种尴尬。因为，德拉米发言者与圆桌会议的其他成员，势必会跟自己决裂，而在那场即将来临的对决中，这个农妇——苏拉·诺微——将是自己致胜的关键。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>4</p><p>4</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal did not see Novi again till after dinnertime, at which time she was brought to him by the woman to whom he had endlessly explained the situation-at least, the nonsexual character of the situation. She had understood-or, at least, did not dare show any indication of failure to understand, which was perhaps just as good.</p><p>坚迪柏整天都没有再见到诺微，直到晚餐后，帮诺微打点的那位妇人才又将她带到他面前。今天早上，坚迪柏曾对那妇人一而再、再而三地解释——至少要她相信，他们两人没有肉体关系。妇人似乎听懂了，或者应该说，起码不敢表现出不解的模样，这样也许就够了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi stood before him now, bashful, proud, embarrassed, triumphant - all at once, in an incongruous mixture.</p><p>此时诺微站在他面前，脸上同时流露出害羞、骄傲、困窘、得意等等错综复杂的表情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "You look very nice, Novi."</p><p>坚迪柏说：“你看来真不错，诺微。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The clothes they had given her fit surprisingly well and there was no question that she did not look at all ludicrous. Had they pinched in her waist? Lifted her breasts? Or had that just been not particularly noticeable in her farmwoman clothing?</p><p>她们帮她找的衣服竟然极为合身，而且她穿起来一点也不显得滑稽。她们是否帮她束过腰？帮她把胸部托高？还是她穿着农妇服装时，这些部分无法突显出来？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her buttocks were prominent, but not displeasingly so. Her face, of course, remained plain, but when the tan of outdoor life faded and she learned how to care for her complexion, it would not look downright ugly.</p><p>她的臀部十分突出，但是不至于难看。当然，她的面容仍然平庸，不过等到被晒黑的肤色褪去，她又学会如何打扮之后，看起来就不会太丑了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By the Old Empire, that woman did think Novi was to be his mistress. She had tried to make her beautiful for him.</p><p>一定是旧帝国的幽灵作祟，那妇人还是把诺微当成了他的情妇，挖空心思让她显得好看一点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then he thought: Well, why not?</p><p>他随即想：嗯，有何不可呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi would have to face the Speaker's Table-and the more attractive she seemed, the more easily he would be able to get his point across.</p><p>诺微终将出现在发言者圆桌会议上。她看起来愈吸引人，自己的立论就愈容易被接受。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was with this thought that the message from the First Speaker reached him. It had the kind of appropriateness that was common in a mentalic society. It was called, more or less informally, the "Coincidence Effect." If you think vaguely of someone when someone is thinking vaguely of you, there is a mutual, escalating stimulation which in a matter of seconds makes the two thoughts sharp, decisive, and, to all appearances, simultaneous.</p><p>他刚想到这一点，第一发言者的讯息便飘然而至。在这个精神挂帅的社会，这是一种理所当然的联络方式，通称为“偶合效应”，但并非十分正式的名称。假如某甲模糊地想到某乙，某乙同时也模糊地想到某甲，便会产生一种相互提升的刺激，几秒钟之内，就能使两人的念头都变得清晰、明确，而且显然彼此同步。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It can be startling even to those who understand it intellectually, particularly if the preliminary vague thoughts were so dim-on one side or the other (or both)-as to have gone consciously unnoticed.</p><p>这种效应有时会让人吓一跳，即使了解来龙去脉的人也不例外。尤其是原先那个念头如果十分含糊——不论是哪一方，或者双方皆然——连当事人也没有意识到的时候。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can't be with you this evening, Novi," said Gendibal. "I have scholar work to do. I will take you to your room. There will be some books there and you can practice your reading. I will show you how to use the signal if you need help with anything-and I will see you tomorrow."</p><p>“诺微，今晚我不能陪你了。”坚迪柏说，“我还有学者的工作要做。我会带你到你的房间，那里有一些书籍，你可以开始练习阅读能力。我也会教你如何使用讯号器，这样你就能随时找人帮忙。我明天会再来看你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>5</p><p>5</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said politely, "First Speaker?"</p><p>坚迪柏很礼貌地说：“第一发言者？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shandess merely nodded. He looked dour and fully his age. He looked as though he were a man who did not drink, but who could use a stiff one. He said finally, "I `called' you……"</p><p>桑帝斯只是点了点头。他显得郁郁寡欢而老态龙钟，看来好像需要喝杯烈酒提振精神。他终于开口道：“我‘召唤’你来……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No messenger. I presumed from the direct `call' that it was important."</p><p>“没有派信差，而是直接‘召唤’，我猜一定有重要的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is. Your quarry-the First Foundationer-Trevize……"</p><p>“没错。你的猎物，那个第一基地人崔维兹……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes?"</p><p>“怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He is not coming to Trantor."</p><p>“他不会来川陀了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal did not look surprised. "Why should he? The information we received was that he was leaving with a professor of ancient history who was seeking Earth."</p><p>坚迪柏并未显出惊讶的神色。“他为什么要来？根据我们获得的情报，他是跟一名古代史教授同行，那名教授打算寻找地球。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, the legendary Primal Planet. And that is why he should be coming to Trantor. After all, does the professor know where Earth is? Do you? Do I? Can we be sure it exists at all, or ever existed? Surely they would have to come to this Library to obtain the necessary information-if it were to be obtained anywhere. I have until this hour felt that the situation was not at crisis level-that the First Foundationer would come here and that we would, through him, learn what we need to know."</p><p>“对，就是那颗传说中的太初行星，这正是他该来川陀的原因。毕竟，那个教授知道地球在哪里吗？你知道吗？我知道吗？我们能确定它存在，或者曾经存在吗？他们当然应该前来此地，寻找必要的资料——如果还有任何资料留下来，一定都藏在银河图书馆。在此之前，我一直认为情况尚未达到危机的程度；我以为那个第一基地人会到这里来，而我们可以从他身上，打探出我们想知道的一切。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Which would certainly be the reason he is not allowed to come here."</p><p>“正是由于这个原因，对方绝不会让他到这里来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But where is he going, then?"</p><p>“那么，他又要到哪里去呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We have not yet found out, I see."</p><p>“我懂了，原来我们还没有查到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said pettishly, "You seem calm about it."</p><p>第一发言者以不悦的口气说：“你好像很冷静。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "I wonder if it is not better so. You want him to come to Trantor to keep him safe and use him as a source of information. Will he not, however, prove a source of more important information, involving others still more important than himself, if he goes where he wants to go and does what he wants to do-provided we do not lose sight of him?"</p><p>坚迪柏答道：“我不懂为何不该冷静。您希望他来到川陀，认为这样就能稳住他，并且从他身上挖取情报。然而，如果让崔维兹去他想去的地方，办他想办的事情，只要我们不把他跟丢了，那么他就可能引出其他方面的情报，而且比他原本所能提供的更为重要。您难道不这么认为吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not enough!" said the First Speaker. "`you have persuaded me of the existence of this new enemy of ours and now I cannot rest. Worse, I have persuaded myself that we must secure Trevize or we have lost everything. I cannot rid myself of the feeling that he-and nothing else-is the key."</p><p>“这还不够！”第一发言者说，“你已经说服我接受有新敌人出现这个想法，现在我根本放不下这件事。更糟的是，我又说服自己一定要锁定崔维兹，否则我们会全盘皆输。他是独一无二的关键，我已经无法摆脱这个看法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said intensely, "Whatever happens, we will not lose, First Speaker. That would only have been possible, if these Anti-Mules, to use your phrase again, had continued to burrow beneath us unnoticed. But we know they are there now. We no longer work blind. At the next meeting of the Table, if we can work together, we shall begin the counterattack."</p><p>坚迪柏慷慨激昂地说：“不论发生任何状况，第一发言者，我们都不会输的。除非那些反骡——让我再次借用您发明的称呼——继续潜伏在我们当中，而我们却不知不觉。但我们已经知道他们的存在，再也不会盲目行事。下一次的圆桌会议，如果大家通力合作，我们就能展开反击。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "It was not the matter of Trevize that had me send out the call to you. The subject came up first only because it seemed to me a personal defeat. I had misanalyzed that aspect of the situation. I was wrong to place personal pique above general policy and I apologize. There is something else."</p><p>第一发言者说：“我召唤你来，其实并不是为了崔维兹这档事。我先跟你提这个问题，只是因为我觉得这是我个人的失败，我对当前的情况作出错误分析。我向你致歉，我不该将个人的好恶置于政策之上。除此之外，还有一件事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"More serious, First Speaker?"</p><p>“更严重的事吗，第一发言者？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"More serious, Speaker Gendibal." The First Speaker sighed and drummed his fingers on the desk while Gendibal stood patiently before it and waited.</p><p>“更严重的事，坚迪柏发言者。”第一发言者长叹一声，不停用手指敲着桌面。坚迪柏则耐着性子，站在书桌前默默等待。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker finally said, in a mild way, as though that would ease the blow, "At an emergency meeting of the Table, initiated by Speaker Delarmi……"</p><p>第一发言者终于再度开口，语气很温和，仿佛如此便能减缓冲击的力道。“德拉米发言者发起了一次紧急圆桌会议……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Without your consent, First Speaker?"</p><p>“第一发言者，未经您的同意？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For what she wanted, she needed the consent of only three other Speakers, not including myself. At the emergency meeting that was then called, you were impeached, Speaker Gendibal. You have been accused as being unworthy of the post of Speaker and you must be tried. This is the first time in over three centuries that a bill of impeachment has been carried out against a Speaker……"</p><p>“她只需要获得其他三名发言者同意，不必包括我在内。在这个紧急会议中，你遭到纠举，坚迪柏发言者。你被指控不配担任发言者的职务，而且必须接受审判。三个多世纪以来，这还是头一次通过发言者的纠举案……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, fighting to keep down any sign of anger, "Surely you did not vote for my impeachment yourself."</p><p>坚迪柏强忍着，不让任何一点怒火冒出来。“您自己当然并未投下赞成票。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I did not, but I was alone. The rest of the Table was unanimous and the vote was ten to one for impeachment. The requirement for impeachment, as you know, is eight votes including the First Speaker-or ten without him."</p><p>“我没有，可是我人单势孤。圆桌会议的其他成员看法一致，因此纠举案以十票对一票通过了。你也知道，纠举案成立的条件，是包括第一发言者在内的八票，或者不包括他在内的十票。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But T was not present."</p><p>“但是我并未出席。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You would not have been able to vote."</p><p>“你根本没有表决权。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I might have spoken in my defense."</p><p>“至少我可以为自己辩护。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not at that stage. The precedents are few, but clear. Your defense will be at the trial, which will come as soon as possible, naturally."</p><p>“但不是在这个阶段。前例虽然很少，可是很明确，你在审判时才有答辩的机会。自然，审判将尽快举行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal bowed his head in thought. Then he said, "This does not concern me overmuch, First Speaker. Your initial instinct, I think, was right. The matter of Trevize takes precedence. May I suggest you delay the trial on that ground?"</p><p>坚迪柏低头沉思了一会儿，然后说：“我倒不怎么担心这件事，第一发言者。我认为您最初的直觉很正确，崔维兹这件事得优先处理。基于这个理由，我能否建议您将审判延期？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker held up his hand. "I don't blame you for not understanding the situation, Speaker. Impeachment is so rare an event that I myself have been forced to look up the legal procedures involved. Nothing takes precedence. We are forced to move directly to the trial, postponing everything else."</p><p>第一发言者举起右手。“我不怪你不了解状况，发言者。纠举案实在太过罕见，我自己都得查阅相关的法定程序。它有最高优先权，我们不得不直接准备审判，而将其他的问题通通延后。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal placed his fists on the desk and leaned toward the First Speaker. "You are not serious?"</p><p>坚迪柏双手握拳抵着桌面，上身倾向第一发言者。“您这话当真吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is the law."</p><p>“这是法律。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The law can't be allowed to stand in the way of a clear and present danger."</p><p>“我们不能碍于法律，而忽视眼前一个明显的威胁。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To the Table, Speaker Gendibal, you are the clear and present danger. -No, listen to me! The law that is involved is based on the conviction that nothing can be more important than the possibility of corruption or the misuse of power on the part of a Speaker."</p><p>“对圆桌会议而言，坚迪柏发言者，你正是眼前那个明显的威胁。别插嘴，听我说！其中所牵涉的法律，立法精神在于一个坚实的信念：没有任何问题，比发言者的腐化或滥用职权更为严重。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I am guilty of neither, First Speaker, and you knew it. This is a matter of a personal vendetta on the part of Speaker Delarmi. If there is misuse of power, it is on her part. My crime is that I have never labored to make myself popular-I admit that much-and I have paid too little attention to fools who are old enough to be senile but young enough to have power."</p><p>“可是两者我都没犯，第一发言者，而您也很清楚。这只是德拉米发言者和我的私人恩怨，如果真有滥用职权的行为，那也是她而不是我。我唯一的罪过是从不在乎人际关系，这点我承认。对于那些还没老到无法掌权，却早就变成老糊涂的笨蛋，我在他们身上花的心思太少了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Like myself, Speaker?"</p><p>“我就是其中之一，发言者？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal sighed. "You see, I've done it again. I don't refer to you, First Speaker. -Very well, then, let us have an instant trial, then. Let us have it tomorrow. Better yet, tonight. Let us get it over with and then pass on to the matter of Trevize. We dare not wait."</p><p>坚迪柏叹了一声。“您瞧，我又得罪人了。我指的不是您，第一发言者。好吧，那么，让我们立即开庭，我们明天就举行审判，或者今晚更好。让我们趁早把它做个了结，然后赶紧处理崔维兹的问题。我们不能再冒险多等片刻。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "Speaker Gendibal. I don't think you understand the situation. We have had impeachments before-not many, just two. Neither of those resulted in a conviction. You, however, will be convicted! You will then no longer be a member of the Table and you will no longer have a say in public policy. You will not, in fact, even have a vote at the annual meeting of the Assembly."</p><p>第一发言者说：“坚迪柏发言者，我想你还不了解目前的状况。我们过去也有过纠举案——不多，仅仅两桩而已，但都没有定罪。然而，这回你会被定罪！你将被逐出圆桌会议，对第二基地的政策再也没有机会发言。事实上，甚至在周年集会中，你也不会再有表决权。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you will not act to prevent that?</p><p>“而您不会出面阻止？”</p></div>
