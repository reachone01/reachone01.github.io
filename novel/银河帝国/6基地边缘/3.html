<div class='layout'><p>CHAPTER THREE HISTORIAN</p><p>第3章 历史学家</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>JANOV PELORAT WAS WHITE-HAIRED AND HIS FACE, IN REPOSE, LOOKED rather empty. It was rarefy in anything but repose. He was of average height and weight and tended to move without haste and to speak with deliberation. He seemed considerably older than his fifty-two years.</p><p>詹诺夫·裴洛拉特满头白发，在没有任何表情的时候，他的面容看起来十分空洞，不过他也绝少有任何表情。身高与体重皆属中等的他，做起事来慢条斯理，说起话来深思熟虑。虽然只有五十二岁，他看起来却老得多。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had never left Terminus, something that was most unusual, especially for one of his profession. He himself wasn't sure whether his sedentary ways were because of-or in spite of-his obsession with history.</p><p>他从未离开过端点星，这是一件很不寻常的事，对于他这一行的人而言，更是极端不寻常。连他自己也不确定，是否因为过于沉迷历史，才会事事有如老僧入定。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The obsession had come upon him quite suddenly at the age of fifteen when, during some indisposition, he was given a book of early ~~, legends. In it, he found the repeated motif of a world that was alone and isolated - a world that was not even aware of its isolation, since it had never known anything else.</p><p>他对历史的迷恋始于十五岁那年，起因相当偶然。那次他生了一场小病，只好抱着一本讲述早期传说的书解闷。在那本书中，不断提到一个与世隔绝的世界——那个世界甚至不知道自己是孤立的，因为从未听说其他世界的存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His indisposition began to clear up at once. Within two days, he had read the book three times and was out of bed. The day after that he was at his computer terminal, checking for any records that the Terminus University Library might have on similar legends.</p><p>他的病马上有了起色。两天内，他把那本书从头到尾读了三遍，就已经能起床了。又过了一天，他坐在自己的电脑终端机前，联线到端点大学图书馆，查询有关这类传说的藏书目录。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was precisely such legends that had occupied him ever since. The Terminus University Library had by no means been a great resource in this respect but, when he grew older, he discovered the joys of interlibrary loans. He had printouts in his possession which had been taken off hyper-radiational signals from as far away as Ifnia.</p><p>从此以后，这类传说成为他生命的全部重心。端点大学图书馆在这方面的典藏，虽然已经十分权威，但是等到年纪再大一点，他又发现了通过“馆际合作”搜集资料的乐趣。在他所搜集的列印稿中，竟然有远从伊夫尼亚经由超辐射波讯号所送达的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had become a professor of ancient history and was now beginning his first sabbatical - one for which he had applied with the idea of taking a trip through space (his first) to Trantor itself - thirty-seven years later. </p><p>三十七年后的今天，他早已成为专攻古代史的教授。如今，他正开始休第一次的长假——他准备利用这一年的假期，进行一趟川陀之旅，这将是他生平首次的太空旅行。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat was quite aware that it was most unusual for a person of Terminus to have never been in space. It had never been his intention to be notable in this particular way. It was just that whenever he might have gone into space, some new book, some new study, some new analysis came his way. He would delay his projected trip until he had wrung the new matter dry and had added, if possible, one more item of fact, or speculation, or imagination to the mountain he had collected. In the end, his only regret was that the particular trip to Trantor had never been made.</p><p>裴洛拉特自己也明白，像他这种从未上过太空的人，在端点星可说是极稀有的动物。他并不是有意如此特立独行，只不过每次有机会上太空的时候，总会有什么新的书籍、新的研究结果、新的分析报告出现。于是，他不得不将计划好的行程延期，直到把那些材料彻底消化为止。然后，如果可能的话，他会在已经堆积如山的资料中，再批注一笔所谓的“事实”“臆测”或“想象”。到头来，他唯一的遗憾，就是川陀之旅始终未能成行。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trantor had been the capital of the First Galactic Empire. It had been the seat of Emperors for twelve thousand years and, before that, the capital of one of the most important pre-Imperial kingdoms, which had, little by little, captured or otherwise absorbed the other kingdoms to establish the Empire.</p><p>川陀曾经是第一银河帝国的首都，前后长达一万两千年之久。而在前帝国时代，川陀则是一个重要王国的京城，这个王国逐步鲸吞蚕食其他各个王国，最后终于建立空前的大帝国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trantor had been a world-girdling city, a metal-coated city. Pelorat had read of it in the works of Gaal Dornick, who had visited it in the time of Hari Seldon himself. Dornick's volume no longer circulated and the one Pelorat owned might have been sold for half the historian's annual salary. A suggestion that he might part with it would have horrified the historian.</p><p>川陀是个环球的单一大都会，是个金属包覆的城市。从盖尔·多尼克的著作中，裴洛拉特读到过有关川陀的一切。那位作者与哈里·谢顿同一时代，年轻时曾经游历川陀。多尼克的书早已绝版多年，裴洛拉特所珍藏的那一本，如果出售的话，应该能赚到一名历史教授半年的薪水。不过光是听到这个建议，这位历史学家就会惶惶不可终日。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Of course, what Pelorat cared about, as far as Trantor was concerned, was the Galactic Library, which in Imperial times (when it was the Imperial Library) had been the largest in the Galaxy. Trantor was the capital of the largest and most populous Empire humanity had ever seen. It had been a single worldwide city with a population well in excess of forty billion, and its Library had been the gathered record of all the creative (and not-so-creative) work of humanity, the full summary of its knowledge. And it was all computerized in so complex a manner that it took experts to handle the computers.</p><p>当然，裴洛拉特对川陀唯一感兴趣的地方，只有该处的“银河图书馆”。在帝政时代，它曾是银河中最大的图书馆（当时的名称为“帝国图书馆”）。第一银河帝国是人类有史以来版图最庞大、人口最众多的帝国，而身为首都的川陀，则是由一个世界所构成的单一城市，拥有超过四百亿的人口。因此那座图书馆的收藏，涵盖了人类所有原创性（或辗转抄袭）的智慧结晶，可谓人类一切知识的总和。它的作业完全电脑化，但由于电脑系统过于复杂，唯有专家才懂得如何操作运用。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What was more, the Library had survived. To Pelorat, that was the amazing thing about it. When Trantor had fallen and been sacked, nearly two and a half centuries before, it had undergone appalling destruction, and the tales of human misery and death would not bear repeating-yet the Library had survived, protected (it was said) by the University students, who used ingeniously devised weapons. (Some thought the defense by the students might well have been thoroughly romanticized.)</p><p>更重要的是，银河图书馆依然安在。对裴洛拉特而言，这才是最令人惊讶的事实。两百多年前，当川陀陷落敌手并惨遭劫掠时，各地都遭到严重的破坏，无数烧杀掳掠、惨绝人寰的故事，实在令人不忍重述。然而银河图书馆竟然幸免于难，（据说）这是川陀大学的学生誓死保卫的结果。这些大学生发明出一些神秘的武器，因而能够以寡敌众。不过也有人认为，这种学生志愿军的说法当然只是无稽之谈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In any case, the Library had endured through the period of devastation. Ebling Mis had done his work in an intact Library in a ruined world when he had almost located the Second Foundation (according to the story which the people of the Foundation still believed, but which historians have always treated with reserve). The three generations of Darells-Bayta, Toran, and Arkady-had each, at one time or another, been on Trantor. However, Arkady had not visited the Library, and since her time the Library had not impinged on Galactic history.</p><p>无论如何，总之银河图书馆安然渡过一场浩劫。后来，艾布林·米斯来到这个废墟世界，钻进依旧完好的图书馆，在那里进行过详尽的研究，差一点就找到第二基地的位置（基地同胞至今仍旧相信这种说法，但历史学家始终不以为然）。而达瑞尔家族前后三代——贝泰、杜伦以及艾卡蒂——也曾先后到过川陀。然而，艾卡蒂从未造访过银河图书馆，而且从她那个时代起，这座图书馆再也未曾跃上银河历史的舞台。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No Foundationer had been on Trantor in a hundred and twenty years, but there was no reason to believe the Library was not still there. That it had made no impingement was the surest evidence in favor of its being there. Its destruction would surely have made a noise.</p><p>过去一百二十年来，没有任何基地人去过川陀，但这并不代表银河图书馆不复存在。银河中没有关于它的任何流言，就是它依然存在的最佳证明。如果它遭到摧毁，必然会引起轩然大波。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Library was outmoded and archaic-it had been so even in Ebling Mis's time-but that was all to the good. Pelorat always rubbed his hands with excitement when he thought of an old and outmoded Library. The older and the more outmoded, the more likely it was to have what he needed. In his dreams, he would enter the Library and ask in breathless alarm, "Has the Library been modemized? Have you thrown out the old tapes and computerizations?" And always he imagined the answer from dusty and ancient librarians, "As it has been, Professor, so is it still."</p><p>这座图书馆必定既陈旧又古老——在艾布林·米斯的时代已经如此——可是这样再好不过。每当想到一座既老旧又过时的图书馆时，裴洛拉特就会兴奋地猛搓双手。愈是老旧，愈是过时，就愈可能保有他想要找的东西。他常常梦见自己走进银河图书馆，紧张兮兮地问道：“这座图书馆已经现代化了吗？你们有没有将那些老旧的电脑磁带丢弃？”每次在睡梦中，他都会见到一个满身灰尘的古代图书馆员，答道：“一点都没有变，教授，仍然和过去一模一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now his dream would come true. The Mayor herself had assured him of that. How she had known of his work, he wasn't quite sure. He had not succeeded in publishing many papers. Little of what he had done was solid enough to be acceptable for publication and what had appeared had left no mark. Still, they said Branno the Bronze knew all that went on in Terminus and had eyes at the end of every finger and toe. Pelorat could almost believe it, but if she knew of his work, why on Terminus didn't she see its importance and give him a little financial support before this?</p><p>如今，他的梦想终于要实现了，市长亲自向他保证过。至于她究竟如何获悉他的工作，连他自己也不太清楚。他并没有发表过多少论文，因为他的研究大多缺乏充分的佐证，很少为学术期刊接受；而他发表过的少数文章，也从未激起任何回响。话说回来，据说铜人布拉诺对端点星上的一切都了若指掌，每一个角落都有她的耳目。裴洛拉特几乎可以相信这个说法，可是，如果她原来就知晓自己的工作，为何没有早点看出重要性，提供他一点经费补助呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Somehow, he thought, with as much bitterness as he could generate, the Foundation had its eyes fixed firmly on the future. It was the Second Empire and their destiny that absorbed them. They had no time, no desire, to peer back into the past-and they were irritated by those who did.</p><p>或许最主要的原因，他以无比悲痛的心情沉思，是由于基地仅专注于未来，大家的注意力都集中在第二帝国以及自身的命运。所以他们没有时间，也没有心思，去回顾一下过去的历史，甚至敌视有心回顾的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The more fools they, of course, but he could not single-handedly wipe out folly. And it might be better so. He could hug the great pursuit to his own chest and the day would come when he would be remembered as the great Pioneer of the Important.</p><p>那些人当然愚不可及，可是他又无法凭借一己之力，将愚昧一扫而尽。不过，这样其实也不错，让他得以独享一项伟大的研究工作。总有一天，后人会将他奉为一位伟大的“先驱者”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That meant, of course (and he was too intellectually honest to refuse to perceive it), that he, too, was absorbed in the future-a future in which he would be recognized, and in which he would be a hero on a par with Hari Seldon. In fact, he would be the greater, for how could the working out of a clearly visualized future a millennium long stand comparison with the working out of a lost past at least twenty-five millennia old.</p><p>当然，这也代表说（他对自己太过诚实，所以不会拒绝承认），他本人同样极重视未来——那时人人都会知晓他的大名，视之为与哈里·谢顿齐名的英雄人物。其实，他应该更伟大些，因为谢顿只是明确规划了未来一千年的历史，他却发掘出一个至少湮没了两万五千年之久的重大史迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And this was the day; this was the day.</p><p>他终于等到了这一天，这一天终于来临了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Mayor had said it would be the day after Seldon's image made its appearance. That was the only reason Pelorat had been interested in the Seldon Crisis that for months had occupied every mind on Terminus and indeed almost every mind in the Federation.</p><p>市长曾经说，等到谢顿影像出现之后，第二天他就能展开工作。裴洛拉特之所以对这次的谢顿危机感兴趣，这便是唯一的原因。事实上，过去数个月来，端点星上的居民，乃至联邦的每一个人，都将所有的注意力集中在这个危机上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It had seemed to him to make the most trifling difference as to whether the capital of the Foundation had remained here at Terminus, or had been shifted somewhere else. And now that the crisis had been resolved, he remained unsure as to which side of the matter Hari Seldon had championed, or if the matter under dispute had been mentioned at all.</p><p>在他看来，基地的首都究竟应该留在端点星，还是应该迁到别处，实在没有丝毫差别。如今危机虽然已经圆满解决，他还是不清楚哈里·谢顿到底支持哪一方，甚至根本不知道，谢顿究竟有没有提到这个喧腾一时的问题。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was enough that Seldon had appeared and that now this was the day.</p><p>只要谢顿出现过就行了，盼望已久的这一天终于来临了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a little after two in the afternoon that a ground-car slid to a halt in the driveway of his somewhat isolated house just outside Terminus proper.</p><p>下午二时刚过，在裴洛拉特位于端点市近郊、那座有点孤立的住宅前，一辆地面车停了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A rear door slid back. A guard in the uniform of the Mayoralty Security Corps stepped out, then a young man, then two more guards.</p><p>车子的后门立刻滑开，一名穿着“市长安全警卫队”制服的警卫率先下车。接着下车的是一个年轻人，跟着又是两名警卫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat was impressed despite himself. The Mayor not only knew of his work but clearly considered it of the highest importance. The person who was to be his companion was given an honor guard, and he had been promised a first-class vessel which his companion would be able to pilot. Most flattering! Most-</p><p>裴洛拉特颇有受宠若惊的感觉。市长不但了解他的工作，显然还对他极为重视。将要和他同行的这个年轻人，竟然还有警卫护送。市长答应提供他一艘一流的太空船，想必将由这个年轻人驾驶。简直是太给面子了！简直……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat's housekeeper opened the door. The young man entered and the two guards positioned themselves on either side of the entrance. Through the window, Pelorat saw that the third guard remained outside and that a second ground-car had now pulled up. Additional guards!</p><p>裴洛拉特的管家打开大门，那个年轻人便走了进来，两名警卫则在门口两侧站岗。裴洛拉特由窗户望出去，看见第三名警卫仍然待在外面，这时又有一辆地面车驶来，载来更多的警卫！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Confusing!</p><p>怎么回事？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He turned to find the young man in his room and was surprised to find that he recognized him. He had seen him on holocasts. He said, "You're that Councilman. You're Trevize!"</p><p>他转过身来，看到那个年轻人已经走进房间。他惊讶地发现，自己竟然认得这个人，因为曾经在全息电视上看过他。他立刻说：“你就是那位议员，你是崔维兹！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Golan Trevize. That's right. You are Professor Janov Pelorat?"</p><p>“葛兰·崔维兹便是在下。你是詹诺夫·裴洛拉特教授吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, yes," said Pelorat. "Are you he who will……"</p><p>“是的，是的。”裴洛拉特说，“你就是那位将要……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We are going to be fellow travelers," said Trevize woodenly. "Or so I have been told."</p><p>“我们两人将要同行，”崔维兹木然道，“至少据我所知，是这样安排的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But you're not a historian."</p><p>“但你并不是历史学家。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I'm not. As you said, I'm a Councilman, a politician."</p><p>“没错，我不是。正如你所说，我是一名议员，是个政治人物。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes- Yes- But what am I thinking about? I am a historian, therefore what need for another? You can pilot a spaceship."</p><p>“是的——是的——我的脑袋到底在想什么？我自己就是历史学家，何必还需要一位？你自己会驾驶太空船吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I'm pretty good at that."</p><p>“会，这方面我很内行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, that's what we need, then. Excellent! I'm afraid I'm not one of your practical thinkers, young man, so if it should happen that you are, we'll make a good team."</p><p>“好极了，这正是我们需要的。太棒啦！年轻人，恐怕我并非行动派，所以只要你是，我们就能成为很好的搭档。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "I am not, at the moment, overwhelmed with the excellence of my own thinking, but it seems we have no choice but to try to make it a good team."</p><p>崔维兹说：“此时此刻，我对自己的本事也没多少信心，不过我们似乎别无选择，只好尽量协调合作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Let's hope, then, that I can overcome my uncertainty about space. I've never been in space, you know, Councilman. I am a groundhog, if that's the term. Would you like a glass of tea, by the way? I'll have Moda prepare us something. It is my understanding that it will be some hours before we leave, after all. I am prepared right now, however. I have what is necessary for both of us. The Mayor has been most co-operative. Astonishing-her interest in the project."</p><p>“那么，希望我自己能克服对太空的疑惧。你知道吗，议员，我从来没有上过太空。我是一只土拨鼠，这样讲大概没错。对了，你要不要来杯茶？我可以叫柯罗达替我们准备一点吃的。反正据我了解，我们几小时后才会出发。然而，我已经准备好了，我们两人需要的东西都齐备了。市长表现得极为合作，她对这个计划的兴趣令我惊讶不已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "You've known about this, then? How long?"</p><p>崔维兹问道：“这么说，你已经晓得这件事？是多久以前？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Mayor approached me" (here Pelorat frowned slightly and seemed to be making certain calculations) "two, or maybe three, weeks ago. I was delighted. And now that I have got it clear in my head that I need a pilot and not a second historian, I am also delighted that my companion will be you, my dear fellow."</p><p>“市长来找我，”裴洛拉特微微皱起眉头，似乎是在算日子，“是两个，或者三个星期以前的事，那天我简直高兴极了。现在我的脑袋终于想通了，我需要的是一名驾驶员，而不是另一位历史学家。我很高兴同行的是你，我亲爱的伙伴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Two, maybe three, weeks ago," repeated Trevize, sounding a little dazed. "She was prepared all this time, then. And I……" He faded out.</p><p>“两三个星期以前。”崔维兹重复了一遍，声音有点茫然，“她早就有所准备，而我……”他的声音愈来愈小。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Pardon me?"</p><p>“请问你在说什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing, Professor. I have a bad habit of muttering to myself. It is something you will have to grow accustomed to, if our trip extends itself."</p><p>“没什么，教授，我向来有自言自语的坏习惯。如果我们的旅程会拖得很长，一路上你得多多包涵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It will. It will," said Pelorat, bustling the other to the dining room table, where an elaborate tea was being; prepared by his housekeeper. "Quite open-ended. The Mayor said we were to take as long as we liked and that the Galaxy lay all before us and, indeed, that wherever we went we could call upon Foundation funds. She said, of course, that we would have to be reasonable. I promised that much." He chuckled and rubbed his hands: "Sit down, my good fellow, sit down. This may be our last meal on Terminus for a very long time."</p><p>“一定会是长途旅行，一定会的。”裴洛拉特一面说，一面将对方拉进餐厅，餐桌上早已准备好精致的茶点。“行程相当自由。市长说，我们想去多久就去多久，爱到银河哪一处便到哪一处，而且，不论我们去哪里，都可以动用联邦基金。当然，她说过，我们的花费得合情合理，我一口就答应下来。”他咯咯笑了几声，又搓了搓手。“坐下来，我的好伙伴，坐下来。吃完这一顿，不知何年何月，我们才会再回到端点星。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize sat down. He said, "Do you have a family, Professor?"</p><p>崔维兹依言坐下，然后说：“教授，你有家室吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have a son. He's on the faculty at Santanni University. A chemist, I believe, or something like that. He took after his mother's side. She hasn't been with me for a long time, so you see I have no responsibilities, no active hostages to fortune. I trust you have none - help yourself to the sandwiches, my boy."</p><p>“我有一个儿子，他是圣塔尼大学的教授。我相信他研究的是化学，或是类似的学问，他走的是他母亲的路子。我太太和我已经分开很久了，所以你看，我一个人无牵无挂，根本没有任何家累。我相信你也没有——吃点三明治吧，好孩子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No hostages at the moment. A few women. They come and go."</p><p>“我现在也没有家累。我有过几个女人，但总是来来去去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Yes. Delightful when it works out. Even more delightful when you find it need not be taken seriously. -No children, I take it.</p><p>“对，对，这样子最轻松愉快。如果不必认真，那就更加轻松愉快。我猜，也没小孩吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"None."</p><p>“没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Good! You know, I'm in the most remarkable good humor. I was taken aback when you first came in. I admit it. But I find you quite exhilarating now. What I need is youth and enthusiasm and someone who can find his way about the Galaxy. We're on a search, you know. A remarkable search." Pelorat's quiet face and quiet voice achieved an unusual animation without any particular change in either expression or intonation. "I wonder if you have been told about this.</p><p>“好极了！你知道吗，我现在的心情再好不过了。我承认，当你刚走进来的时候，我吓了一大跳，可是我现在愈瞧你愈顺眼。我需要的正是像你这样的人，朝气蓬勃，热情洋溢，而且有办法飞遍整个银河。你知道吗，我们要去从事一项探索，一项了不起的探索。”裴洛拉特一向稳重的面容与声音，此时突然充满生气，不过表情与声调并没有明显的变化。“不晓得你是否知道详情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize's eyes narrowed. "A remarkable search?"</p><p>崔维兹眯起眼睛。“一项了不起的探索？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes indeed. A pearl of great price is hidden among the tens of millions of inhabited worlds in the Galaxy and we have nothing but the faintest clues to guide us. just the same, it will be an incredible prize if we can find it. If you and I can carry it off, my boy - Trevize, I should say, for I don't mean to patronize-our names will ring down the ages to the end of time."</p><p>“一点都没错。有一颗无价的珍珠，隐藏在银河系千万住人世界之中，我们却只有极其模糊的线索。话说回来，我们若能把它找到，就会得到不可思议的报偿。如果你我能够成功，好孩子——崔维兹，我这么说，绝不是故意要你领情——我们的名字必定永垂不朽。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The prize you speak of-this pearl of great price……"</p><p>“你所说的报偿——那颗无价的珍珠……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I sound like Arkady Darell-the writer, you know-speaking of the Second Foundation, don't I? No wonder you look astonished." Pelorat-leaned his head back as though he were going to break into loud laughter but he merely smiled. "Nothing so silly and unimportant, I assure you."</p><p>“我这番话听来像是模仿艾卡蒂·达瑞尔——那个名作家，你知道吧——她提到第二基地的时候，就是用这种口气，对不对？怪不得你看起来那么惊讶。”裴洛拉特脑袋向后一仰，好像准备大笑几声，结果只露出一丝微笑。“我向你保证，绝不是那么愚蠢、那么微不足道的东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "If you are not speaking of the Second Foundation, Professor, what are you speaking of?"</p><p>崔维兹又问：“既然不是第二基地，教授，你说的到底又是什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat was suddenly grave, even apologetic. "Ah, then the Mayor has not told you? -It is odd, you know. I've spent decades resenting the government and its inability to understand what I'm doing, and now Mayor Branno is being remarkably generous."</p><p>裴洛拉特的表情突然严肃起来，甚至略带歉意。“啊，那么市长还没有告诉你？你知道吗，这倒有点古怪。过去几十年来，我对政府一直非常不满，因为他们向来无法了解我的工作。现在，布拉诺市长却大方得不得了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said Trevize, not trying to conceal an intonation of irony, "she is a woman of remarkable hidden philanthropy, but she has not told me what this is all about."</p><p>“没错，”崔维兹故意透出揶揄的语调，“她这个女人，骨子里是大善人，可是她并未告诉我一切的来龙去脉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You are not aware of my research, then?"</p><p>“这么说，你对我的研究工作一无所知？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. I'm sorry."</p><p>“是的，很抱歉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No need to excuse yourself. Perfectly all right. I have not exactly made a splash. Then let me tell you. You and I are going to search for-and find, for I have an excellent possibility in mind-Earth."</p><p>“不必感到抱歉，绝对没关系，反正我还没有什么惊人的成就。那么我来告诉你吧，你和我将要去寻找‘地球’，而且一定能找到，因为我已经胸有成竹。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize did not sleep well that night.</p><p>那天晚上，崔维兹睡得很不好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Over and over, he thrashed about the prison that the old woman had built around him. Nowhere could he find a way out.</p><p>他觉得自己好像被关进一所监狱，是那个老太婆专门为他盖的监狱。他不断四下冲撞，却怎么也找不到出路。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was being driven into exile and he could do nothing about it. She had been calmly inexorable and did not even take the trouble to mask the unconstitutionality of it all. He had relied on his rights as a Councilman and as a citizen of the Federation, and she hadn't even paid them lip service.</p><p>他即将遭到放逐，可是一点办法也没有。而她始终表现得冷酷无情，甚至连公然违宪也懒得掩饰。自己原先所倚仗的，是身为议员和联邦公民的种种权利，不料她连口头上的尊重都没有。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now this Pelorat, this odd academic who seemed to be located in the world without being part of it, told him that the fearsome old woman had been making arrangements for this for weeks.</p><p>如今，又冒出这个叫做裴洛拉特的古怪学究。这个人根本像是活在另一个世界，而他竟然说，早在几星期前，那个可怕的老太婆已经安排好这一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He felt like the "boy" that she had called him.</p><p>他不禁觉得自己真是她口中的“孩子”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was to be exiled with a historian who kept "dear fellowing" him and who seemed to be in a noiseless fit of joy over beginning a Galactic search for-Earth?</p><p>他即将跟着一个不停叫他“亲爱伙伴”的历史学家一起流浪，此人对于即将展开的泛银河探索兴奋不已，而他竟然要去找什么地球？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What in the name of the Mule's grandmother was Earth?</p><p>地球是什么？大概只有骡的奶奶知道！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had asked. Of course! He had asked upon the moment of its mention.</p><p>他曾经追问裴洛拉特。当然要问！他第一时间就问了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had said, "Pardon me, Professor. I am ignorant of your specialty and I trust you won't be annoyed if I ask for an explanation in simple terms. What is Earth?"</p><p>当时他说：“对不起，教授，我对你的专业不大了解。如果我请求你，用简单的方式解释一下地球，相信你不会介意吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat stared at him gravely while twenty seconds moved slowly past. He said, "It is a planet. The original planet. The one on which human beings first appeared, my dear fellow."</p><p>裴洛拉特换上一副严肃的表情，足足瞪了他二十秒钟，然后才说：“它是一颗行星，是人类的发源地。人类最早就是出现在这颗行星上，我亲爱的伙伴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize stared. "First appeared? From where?"</p><p>崔维兹瞪大眼睛。“最早出现？从哪里出现的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"From nowhere. It's the planet on which humanity developed through evolutionary processes from lower animals."</p><p>“凭空出现的。在这颗行星上，人类是经由演化过程，从低等动物逐渐演化而来的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize thought about it, then shook his head. "I don't know what you mean."</p><p>崔维兹想了想，然后摇了摇头。“我不懂你在说些什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>An annoyed expression crossed Pelorat's face briefly. He cleared his throat and said, "There was a time when Terminus had no human beings upon it. It was settled by human beings from other worlds. You know that, I suppose?"</p><p>裴洛拉特脸上闪过一丝恼怒的表情。他清了清嗓子，然后说：“几百年前，端点星上也没有人类。端点星上的居民，最早都是从别的世界移民而来的。我想，这点你总该知道吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, of course," said Trevize impatiently. He was irritated at the other's sudden assumption of pedagogy.</p><p>“没错，当然知道。”崔维兹不耐烦地说。对方突然给他上课，令他感到很不高兴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Very well. This is true of all the other worlds. Anacreon, Santanni, Kalgan - all of them. They were all, at some time in the past, founded. People arrived there from other worlds. It's true even of Trantor. It may have been a great metropolis for twenty thousand years, but before that it wasn't."</p><p>“很好，这种情形其他世界也完全一样。安纳克里昂、圣塔尼、卡尔根……每个世界都是如此。它们都是在过去某个年代，由人类所建立的殖民世界。其上的居民，都是从其他世界迁移过去的，就连川陀也不例外。川陀这个伟大的都会，虽然已有两万年的历史，可是在此之前，它却并非如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, what was it before that?"</p><p>“啊，两万年前它是什么样子？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Empty? At least of human beings."</p><p>“空空如也！至少上面没有人类。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's hard to believe."</p><p>“实在令人难以置信。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's true. The old records show it."</p><p>“是真的，古老的记录中就是这么记载的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where did the people come from who first settled Trantor?"</p><p>“第一批殖民川陀的人类，又是从哪里来的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No one is certain. There are hundreds of planets which claim to have been populated in the dim mists of antiquity and whose people present fanciful tales about the nature of the first arrival of humanity. Historians tend to dismiss such things and to brood over the `Origin Question.</p><p>“谁也不确定。至少有好几百颗行星，都声称在遥远模糊的远古时代，就已经有人类生存其上。而那些行星对于第一代移民，一律有些奇妙的传说。历史学家通常并不接受那些说法，只专注于‘起源问题’的研究。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is that? I've never heard of it."</p><p>“那又是什么？我从来没听过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That doesn't surprise me. It's not a popular historical problem now, I admit, but there was a time during the decay of the Empire when it roused a certain interest among intellectuals. Salvor Hardin mentions it briefly in his memoirs. It's the question of the identity and location of the one Planet from which it all started. If ,we look backward in time, humanity flows inward from the most recently established worlds to older ones, to still older ones, until all concentrates on one-the original."</p><p>“这点我倒不意外，我必须承认，现在它并不是一个流行的历史题目。可是当年，在银河帝国走下坡的那段时期，它曾经吸引一些知识分子的注意。塞佛·哈定在回忆录中，也曾约略提到过。这个题目探讨物种起源于哪颗行星，它的位置又在哪里。假如我们能让时光不断倒流，就会发现人类从最近建立的世界，逐渐回流到那些较旧的世界，依此类推，最后则会通通聚集到某一个世界——人类的发源地。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize thought at once of the obvious flaw in the argument. "Might there not have been a large number of originals?"</p><p>崔维兹马上想到，这个推论有个明显的破绽。“难道说，发源地不能有许多个吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course not. All human beings all over the Galaxy are of a single species. A single species cannot originate on more than one planet. Quite impossible."</p><p>“当然不能。银河中所有的人类，全都属于同一个物种。同一个物种，只可能发源自一颗行星，不会有其他可能。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How do you know?"</p><p>“你又怎么知道？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In the first place……" Pelorat ticked off the first finger of his left hand with the first finger of his right, and then seemed to think better of what would undoubtedly have been a long and intricate exposition. He put both hands at his side and said with great earnestness, "My dear fellow, I give you my word of honor."</p><p>“首先……”裴洛拉特用右手食指点了点左手食指。显然他原本想要发表繁复的长篇大论，却好像忽然改变了主意。于是他将双手放下来，以极为诚恳的语气说：“我亲爱的伙伴，我以人格向你担保。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize bowed formally and said, "I would not dream of doubting it, Professor Pelorat. Let us say, then, that there is one planet of origin, but might there not be hundreds who lay claim to the honor?"</p><p>崔维兹对他一鞠躬，然后说：“我做梦也不会怀疑你，裴洛拉特教授。那么，根据你的说法，起源行星只有一个，可是会不会有好几百个世界，都宣称这个光荣属于他们的行星？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There not only might be, there are. Yet every claim is without merit. Not one of those hundreds that aspire to the credit of priority shows any trace of a prehyperspatial society, let alone any trace of human evolution from prehuman organisms."</p><p>“岂只会不会，而是真的那么讲，但是那些说法通通没有什么价值。那数百个渴望争取这份光荣的世界，都找不到任何‘前超空间社会’的遗迹，更不存在低等生物演化成人类的迹象。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then are you saying that there is a planet of origin, but that, for some reason, it is not making the claim?"</p><p>“那么你是说，这颗起源行星的确存在，可是由于某种原因，它自己并没有张扬？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have hit it precisely."</p><p>“你完全说对了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you are going to search for it?"</p><p>“而你要去寻找这颗行星？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We are. That is our mission. Mayor Branno has arranged it all. You will pilot our ship to Trantor."</p><p>“是我们要去，这就是我们的任务。布拉诺市长全部安排好了，你将负责驾驶太空船，直奔川陀。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To Trantor? It's not the planet of origin. You said that much a while ago."</p><p>“直奔川陀？它并不是起源行星啊，刚才你自己明明说过的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course Trantor isn't. Earth is."</p><p>“川陀当然不是，地球才是。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then why aren't you telling me to pilot the ship to Earth?"</p><p>“那么你为何不说，要我驾太空船直奔地球呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am not making myself clear. Earth is a legendary name. It is enshrined in ancient myths. It has no meaning we can be certain of, but it is convenient to use the word as a one-syllable synonym for `the planet of origin of the human species.' just which planet in real space is the one we are defining as `Earth' is not known."</p><p>“我并没有说清楚。地球只是传说中的一个名字，借着古代的神话传说保存下来，除此之外并没有任何意义。但是用它来代表‘人类起源的那颗行星’，总是一种比较方便的称呼。可是在银河系中，究竟哪颗行星才是我们所谓的地球，却没有任何人知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Will they know on Trantor?"</p><p>“川陀上有人知道吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I hope to find information there, certainly. Trantor possesses the Galactic Library, the greatest in the system."</p><p>“当然，我希望能从那里找到资料。川陀拥有银河图书馆，那是全银河最伟大的资料中心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely that Library has been searched by those people you said were interested in the `Origin Question' in the time of the First Empire."</p><p>“在第一帝国时代，你刚才说的那些对于‘起源问题’有兴趣的人，必定已经翻遍了那座图书馆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat nodded thoughtfully, "Yes, but perhaps not well enough. I have learned a great deal about the `Origin Question' that perhaps the Imperials of five centuries back did not know. I might search the old records with greater understanding, you see. I have been thinking about this for a long time and I have an excellent possibility in mind."</p><p>裴洛拉特若有所思地点了点头。“没错，但是也许并不彻底。我对‘起源问题’有极深入的研究，五世纪前的帝国学者，也许都不如我知道得那么多。我或许能以超越前人的领悟力，去钻研那些古老的记录，你懂了吧。我对这个问题已经思考很久，早已胸有成竹了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have told Mayor Branno all this, I imagine, and she approves?"</p><p>“我猜，你把这些都跟布拉诺市长说过了，而她都赞同？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Approves? My dear fellow, she was ecstatic. She told me that Trantor was surely the place to find out all I needed to know."</p><p>“赞同？我亲爱的伙伴，她简直乐坏了。她告诉我，想找到我需要的答案，当然就要到川陀去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No doubt," muttered Trevize.</p><p>“这点毫无疑问。”崔维兹喃喃地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was part of what occupied him that night. Mayor Branno was sending him out to find out what he could about the Second Foundation. She was sending him with Pelorat so that he might mask his real aim with the pretended search for Earth-a search that could carry him anywhere in the Galaxy. It was a perfect cover, in fact, and he admired the Mayor's ingenuity.</p><p>上面这段对话，就是令他当晚辗转反侧的原因之一。布拉诺市长派他出去，是要他尽力探查第二基地的下落。她又故意派裴洛拉特与他同行，打着去寻找地球的旗号，以便掩护这个真正的目的。这样一来，他就能名正言顺地在银河中横冲直撞。事实上，这真是一个完美的掩护，他不禁对市长的智慧肃然起敬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Trantor? Where was the sense in that? Once they were on Trantor, Pelorat would find his way into the Galactic Library and would never emerge. With endless stacks of books, films, and recordings, with innumerable computerizations and symbolic representations, he would surely never want to leave.</p><p>可是为何要去川陀呢？去那里有什么意义？一旦他们抵达川陀，裴洛拉特便会钻进银河图书馆，再也不肯出来。那里一定有无数的书籍、胶卷和影音记录，还有数不清的电脑磁带与符号媒体，他怎么会舍得离开？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Besides that……</p><p>何况……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Ebling Mis had once gone to Trantor, in the Mule's time. The story was that he had found the location of the Second Foundation there and had died before he could reveal it. But then, so had Arkady Darell, and she had succeeded in locating the Second Foundation. But the location she had found was on Terminus itself, and there the nest of Second Foundationers was wiped out. Wherever the Second Foundation was now would be elsewhere, so what more had Trantor to tell? If be were looking for the Second Foundation, it was best to go anywhere but Trantor.</p><p>艾布林·米斯曾经去过川陀，那是骡刚崛起的时候。根据传说，他在那里找到了第二基地的下落，结果没来得及透露就死了。后来，艾卡蒂·达瑞尔也来到川陀，并成功地揭露了第二基地的位置。不过，她发现第二基地就在端点星上，而那个大本营随即被扫荡干净。如今第二基地东山再起，必定隐藏在别的地方，所以说，川陀又能提供什么情报呢？如果他想寻找第二基地，去哪里都会比川陀有用。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Besides that……</p><p>再说……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What further plans Branno had, he did not know, but he was not in the mood to oblige her. Branno had been ecstatic, had she, about a trip to Trantor? Well, if Branno wanted Trantor, they were not going to Trantor! -Anywhere else. -But not Trantor!</p><p>布拉诺究竟还有什么其他计划，他并不清楚，可是他实在没兴趣讨好她。布拉诺乐坏了，因为他们要去川陀？好，如果布拉诺希望他们前往川陀，他们就偏偏不去！去哪里都好，就是不要去川陀！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And worn out, with the night verging toward dawn, Trevize fell at last into a fitful slumber.</p><p>此时黑夜即将被黎明取代，崔维兹感到筋疲力尽，终于断断续续睡了一阵子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mayor Branno had had a good day on the one following the arrest of Trevize. She had been extolled far beyond her deserts and the incident was never mentioned.</p><p>崔维兹遭到逮捕的第二天，布拉诺市长心情好极了。对于她的成功，大家都歌功颂德不遗余力，至于那段意外的插曲，则没有任何人提及。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nevertheless, she knew well that the Council would soon emerge from its paralysis and that questions would be raised. She would have to act quickly. So, putting a great many matters to one side, she pursued the matter of Trevize.</p><p>纵然如此，她晓得议会不久便会从瘫痪中恢复过来，开始对她提出种种质疑。打铁必须趁热，因此，她把许多正事搁到一边，打算先将崔维兹的问题作个解决。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At the time when Trevize and Pelorat were discussing Earth, Branno was facing Councilman Munn Li Compor in the Mayoralty Office. As he sat across the desk from her, perfectly at ease, she appraised him once again.</p><p>当崔维兹与裴洛拉特讨论地球的时候，布拉诺正在市长办公室接见曼恩·李·康普议员。此时康普坐在市长办公桌对面，表现得极为轻松自然，而市长一开口，便又赞扬了他一番。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was smaller and slighter than Trevize and only two years older. Both were freshmen Councilmen, young and brash, and that must have been the only thing that held them together, for they were different in all other respects.</p><p>相较于崔维兹，康普的个子比较瘦小，年纪则大两岁。两人都是议会的新人，既年轻又莽撞，这必定是他们结为死党的唯一原因，因为除此之外，两人在各方面都截然不同。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Where Trevize seemed to radiate a glowering intensity, Compor shone with an almost serene self-confidence. Perhaps it was his blond hair and blue eyes, not at all common among Foundationers. They lent him an almost feminine delicacy that (Branno judged) made him less attractive to women than Trevize was. He was clearly vain of his looks, though, and made the most of them, wearing his hair rather long and making sure that it was carefully waved. He wore a faint blue shadowing under his eyebrows to accentuate the eye color. (Shadowing of various tints had become common among men these last ten years.)</p><p>崔维兹似乎有点咄咄逼人，康普则流露出沉稳的自信，也许是因为他拥有金发与蓝眼的关系，这种外貌的基地人并不多见。由于这两项特色，他表现出一种近乎女性化的秀气，（布拉诺判断）使他对女性的吸引力远逊于崔维兹。不过，他显然对自己的外表十分自负，还故意发挥得淋漓尽致，不但将头发留得相当长，并仔细烫成波浪状。他的眉下甚至涂有淡淡的蓝色眼影，以凸显那双湛蓝色的眸子。过去十年间，各色眼影已经在男士间相当流行。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was no womanizer. He lived sedately with his wife, but had not yet registered parental intent and was not known to have a clandestine second companion. That, too, was different from Trevize, who changed housemates as often as he changed the loudly colored sashes for which he was notorious.</p><p>他并不是一只花蝴蝶，一直与妻子过着安分的日子，但是直到目前为止，两人尚未为人父母。康普从未有过秘密的恋情，这也是他和崔维兹完全不同的地方。崔维兹换“室友”的勤快程度，足以媲美他换洗那些五颜六色、已经成为他个人招牌的宽腰带。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was little about either young Councilman that Kodell's department had not uncovered, and Kodell himself sat quietly in one corner of the room, exuding a comfortable good cheer as always.</p><p>对于这两位年轻议员的一举一动，柯代尔主持的安全局鲜有不清楚之处。现在，柯代尔坐在市长办公室的一角，照例散发出喜悦的情绪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Branno said, "Councilman Compor, you have done the Foundation good service, but unfortunately for yourself, it is not of the sort that can be praised in public or repaid in ordinary fashion."</p><p>布拉诺说：“康普议员，你为基地立了一件大功，可惜的是，我们无法公开表扬，或是遵循一般方式奖赏你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor smiled. He had white and even teeth, and Branno idly wondered, for one flashing moment if all the inhabitants of the Sirius Sector looked like that. Compor's tale of stemming from that particular, rather peripheral, region went back to his maternal grandmother, who had also been blond-haired and blue-eyed and who had maintained that her mother was from the Sirius Sector. According to Kodell, however, there was no hard evidence in favor of that.</p><p>康普微微一笑，露出洁白整齐的牙齿。布拉诺忽然闪过一个突兀的念头：天狼星区的居民，全都是这种模样吗？天狼星区相当接近银河外缘，康普本人与该处的渊源，要追溯到他的外祖母——她也有着金色的头发与湛蓝的眼珠，而且始终坚持她的母亲来自天狼星区。然而柯代尔调查的结果，并无任何有力证据支持这一点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Women being what they were, Kodell had said, she might well have claimed distant and exotic ancestry to add to her glamour and her already formidable attractiveness.</p><p>柯代尔曾经这么解释：即使已经具有致命的吸引力，女人还是喜欢宣称她们的祖先来自遥远的、充满异国风情的地方，以便给自己再平添几许魅力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is that how women are?" Branno had asked drily, and Kodell had smiled and muttered that he was referring to ordinary women, of course.</p><p>“这是女人的通病吗？”布拉诺曾经用讽刺的口吻问道。柯代尔随即微微一笑，低声说他指的当然是普通的妇女。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor said, "It is not necessary that the people of the Foundation know of my service-only that you do."</p><p>这时，康普答道：“我的贡献并不需要让基地家喻户晓，只要你知道就够了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know and I will not forget. What I also will not do is to let you assume that your obligations are now over. You have embarked on a complicated course and you must continue. We want more about Trevize."</p><p>“我知道了，而且永远不会忘记。此外我还要强调一点，你不要以为自己的责任已经完毕。既然你已经参与这个错综复杂的行动，就必须继续下去。我们要挖出更多有关崔维兹的情报。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have told you all I know concerning him."</p><p>“有关他的一切，我知道的已经全部告诉你了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That may be what you would have me believe. That may even be what you truly believe yourself. Nevertheless, answer my questions. Do you know a gentleman named Janov Pelorat?"</p><p>“那些也许只是你希望我相信的一切，甚至你自己也可能真心相信那些话。无论如何，我要你回答我现在的问题，你认识一位名叫詹诺夫·裴洛拉特的人吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For just a moment Compor's forehead creased, then smoothed itself almost at once. He said carefully, "I might know him if I were to see him, but the name does not seem to cause any association within me."</p><p>一时之间，康普的额头皱了起来，但随即又恢复原状。他以谨慎的口吻说：“假如见到本人，我也许认得出来，可是我对这个名字好像毫无印象。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He is a scholar."</p><p>“他是一位学者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor's mouth rounded into a rather contemptuous but unsounded "Oh?" as though he were surprised that the Mayor would expect him to know scholars.</p><p>康普做了一个“哦？”的轻蔑口型，仿佛没料到市长居然会期望他认识一位学者。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Branno said, "Pelorat is an interesting person who, for reasons of his own, has the ambition of visiting Trantor. Councilman Trevize will accompany him. Now, since you have been a good friend of Trevize and .perhaps know his system of thinking, tell me- Do you think Trevize will consent to go to Trantor?"</p><p>布拉诺继续说：“裴洛拉特是个有趣的人，为了自己的研究工作，他一心想到川陀去一趟，而崔维兹议员将要和他同行。好，你既然是崔维兹的好朋友，或许知道他的思考模式，现在告诉我——你认为崔维兹会乖乖去川陀吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor said, "If you see to it that Trevize gets on the ship, and if the ship is piloted to Trantor, what can he do but go there? Surely you don't suggest he will mutiny and take over the ship."</p><p>康普答道：“假如你将崔维兹押上一艘太空船，而且那艘船预定飞往川陀，那么他还能有什么选择？你该不会认为他将策动喋血事件，劫收那艘太空船吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You don't understand. He and Pelorat will be alone on the ship and it will be Trevize at the controls."</p><p>“你不了解。太空船上只会有他和裴洛拉特两人，而且将由崔维兹负责驾驶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You are asking whether he would go voluntarily to Trantor?"</p><p>“你是想问我，他会不会自动自发地飞向川陀？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, that is what I am asking."</p><p>“对，我问的就是这个。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Madam Mayor, how can I possibly know what he will do?"</p><p>“市长女士，他会怎么做，我又怎么可能知道？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Councilman Compor, you have been close to Trevize. You know his belief in the existence of the Second Foundation. Has he never spoken to you of his theories as to where it might exist, where it might be found?"</p><p>“康普议员，你一直和崔维兹走得很近，知道他坚信第二基地的存在。难道他从来没有跟你提到，他认为第二基地藏在何处，应该去哪里找吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Never, Madam Mayor."</p><p>“从来没有，市长女士。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you think he will find it?"</p><p>“你认为他找得到吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor chuckled. "I think the Second Foundation, whatever it was and however important it might have been, was wiped out in the time of Arkady Darell. I believe her story."</p><p>康普呵呵笑了几声。“我认为第二基地不论是何方神圣，不论过去多么重要，也早就在艾卡蒂·达瑞尔的时代，便已经被摧毁了。我相信她写的故事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Indeed? In that case, why did you betray your friend? If he were searching for something that does not exist, what harm could he have done by propounding his quaint theories?"</p><p>“真的吗？既然如此，为什么你还要出卖朋友？假如他只是在寻找一样并不存在的东西，那么无论提出什么荒诞离奇的理论，又能造成什么伤害呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor said, "It is not the truth alone that can harm. His theories may have been merely quaint, but they might have succeeded in unsettling the people of Terminus and, by introducing doubts and fears as to the Foundation's role in the great drama of Galactic history, have weakened its leadership of the Federation and its dreams of a Second Galactic Empire. Clearly you thought this yourself, or you would not have seized him on the floor of the Council, and you would not now be forcing him into exile without trial. Why have you done so, if I may ask, Mayor?"</p><p>康普说：“并非只有真实消息才会造成伤害。他的说法也许只是荒诞离奇，但仍有可能动摇端点星的人心。倘若对于基地在银河大历史中所扮演的角色，播下怀疑和恐惧的种子，便会削弱端点星在联邦中的领导权，腐蚀我们建立第二银河帝国的使命感。你自己显然也想到了这一点，否则你不会在议场中公然逮捕他，也不会未经审判便强行将他放逐。我能否请问，市长，你为什么要这样做？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Shall we say that I was cautious enough to wonder if there were some faint chance that he might be right, and that the expression of his views might be actively and directly dangerous?"</p><p>“我可否这么说，我有足够的警觉，怀疑他讲的话仍有可能是正确的，因此，他的见解或许会造成具体而直接的危险。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor said nothing.</p><p>康普这次并没有回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Branno said, "I agree with you, but I am forced by the responsibilities of my position to consider the possibility. Let me ask you again if you have any indication as to where he might think the Second Foundation exists, and where he might go."</p><p>布拉诺继续说：“其实我同意你的看法，但是基于职责所在，我必须考虑那个可能性。让我再问你一次，在你看来，他对第二基地的下落有什么想法？他可能打算到哪里去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have none."</p><p>“我完全没有概念。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He has never given you any hints in that direction?"</p><p>“他从未给你这方面的任何暗示吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, of course not."</p><p>“没有，当然没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Never? Don't dismiss the thought easily. Think! Never?"</p><p>“没有？不要那么轻易放弃，好好想一想！从来没有吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Never," said Compor firmly.</p><p>“从来没有。”康普坚定地答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No hints? No joking remarks? No doodles? No thoughtful abstractions at moments that achieve significance as you look back on them?"</p><p>“从来没有一点暗示？没有半句玩笑话？没有信笔写下只字片语？没有突然若有所思地发呆？你好好回想一下，那些举动都可能有重大意义。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"None. I tell you, Madam Mayor, his dreams of the Second Foundation are the most nebulous starshine. You know it, and you but waste your time and your emotions in your concern over it."</p><p>“没有。我告诉你，市长女士，他对第二基地的幻想，是再虚无缥缈不过的梦话。这点你自己也很清楚，而你操这个心，只是在浪费自己的时间和心力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You are not by some chance suddenly changing sides again and protecting the friend you delivered into my hands?"</p><p>“你该不会突然又改变立场，转而保护你亲自交到我手中的朋友吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Compor. "I turned him over to you for what seemed to me to be good and patriotic reasons. I have no reason to regret the action, or to change my attitude."</p><p>“不。”康普说，“我向你举发他，是因为我自认这是正确和爱国的行为。我没有任何理由后悔这样做，或是再改变立场。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then you can give me no hint as to where he might go once he has a ship at his disposal?"</p><p>“那么，一旦把太空船交到他手上，他会飞去哪里，你无法为我提供任何线索？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As I have already said……"</p><p>“我已经说过……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And yet, Councilman," and here the lines of the Mayor's face so folded as to make her seem wistful, "I would like to know where he goes."</p><p>“可是，议员，”市长脸上的皱纹挤在一起，使她看来一副愁苦的样子。“我很想知道他会去哪里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, I think you ought to place a hyper-relay on his ship."</p><p>“既然如此，我想你应该在他的船上，装一个超波中继器。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have thought of that, Councilman. He is, however, a suspicious man and I suspect he will find it-however cleverly it might be placed. Of course, it might be placed in such a way that he cannot remove it without crippling the ship, and he might therefore be forced to leave it in place……"</p><p>“我也这样想过，议员。然而，他是个疑心病重的人，我怕他会把它找出来——不管放置得多么巧妙。当然，我们可以把它固定在某个机件上，如果他硬要拆掉，就会使太空船受损，在这种情况下，他可能只好让它留在那里……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"An excellent notion."</p><p>“高明的招数。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Except that," said Branno, "he would then be inhibited. He might not go where he would go if he felt himself free and untrammeled. The knowledge I would gain would be useless to me."</p><p>“只是这么一来，”布拉诺说，“他的行动就会受到约束。倘若不能随心所欲地自由行动，他也许就不会前往预定的地点。我即使知道他的行踪，也一点用处都没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, it appears you cannot find out where he will go."</p><p>“这样的话，看来你根本无法查出他的动向。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I might, for I intend to be very primitive. A person who expects the completely sophisticated and who guards against it is quite apt never to think of the primitive. -I'm thinking of having Trevize followed."</p><p>“还是有可能，我打算用非常原始的办法。他以为我总是用复杂巧妙的诡计，因此刻意小心提防，却很可能因此忽略了原始的办法——我准备派人跟踪崔维兹。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Followed?"</p><p>“跟踪？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly. By, another pilot in another spaceship. See how astonished you are at the thought? He would be equally astonished. He might not think of scouring space for an accompanying mass and, in any case, we will see to it that his ship is not equipped with our latest mass-detection devices."</p><p>“正是如此，由另一艘太空船上的驾驶员负责跟踪。看，这个想法令你感到多么惊讶？崔维兹一定会有相同的反应。他或许不会想到，他在太空中飞来飞去之际，还有另一艘太空船跟他作伴。反正，我们绝不会在他那艘太空船上，装置我们最先进的质量侦测仪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor said, "Madam Mayor, I speak with all possible respect, but I must point out that you lack experience in space flight. To have one ship followed by another is never done-because it won't work. Trevize will escape with the first hyperspatial jump. Even if he doesn't know he is being followed, that first jump will be his path to freedom. If he doesn't have a hyper-relay on board ship, he can't be traced."</p><p>康普说：“市长女士，我绝非有意冒犯，但是我必须指出，你欠缺太空飞行的实际经验。用一艘太空船跟踪另一艘，这种事从未成功过，因为根本办不到。崔维兹借着第一个超空间跃迁，就会逃之夭夭了。即使他不知道被人跟踪，在首次跃迁之后，他也会变得无影无踪。如果他的太空船上没有超波中继器，绝不可能追踪他的航迹。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I admit my lack of experience. Unlike you and Trevize, I have had no naval training. Nevertheless, I am told by my advisers-who have had such training-that if a ship is observed immediately prior to a jump, its direction, speed, and acceleration make it possible to guess what the jump might be-in a general way. Given a good computer and an excellent sense of judgment, a follower might duplicate the jump closely enough to pick up the trail at the other end -especially if the follower has a good mass-detector."</p><p>“我承认我缺乏经验，不像你和崔维兹那样，曾经接受舰队训练。不过，我有很多顾问可供谘询，他们都跟你们一样，接受过完整的训练。我的顾问告诉我，在一艘太空船跃迁之前的瞬间，跟踪它的太空船若能观测到它的方向、速率和加速度，一般说来，就能估计出它将跃迁到何处去。只要跟踪者拥有一套良好的电脑，以及绝佳的判断力，他就能做出极为接近的跃迁，足以咬住对方的尾巴。若是跟踪者备有精良的质量侦测仪，那就更加事半功倍。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That might happen once," said Compor energetically, "even twice if the follower is very lucky, but that's it. You can't rely on such things."</p><p>“第一次跃迁也许行得通。”康普中气十足地说，“如果跟踪者运气非常好，或许还有第二次，可是顶多到此为止。你不能把希望放在这上面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps we can. -Councilman Compor, you have hyper-raced in your time. You see, I know a great deal about you. You are an excellent pilot and have done amazing things when it comes to following a competitor through a jump."</p><p>“也许可以。康普议员，你当年参加过超空间竞速赛。你看，我对你的背景知之甚详。你是一名优秀的驾驶员，曾经通过一次跃迁咬住对手，创下空前绝后的纪录。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor's eyes widened. He almost squirmed in his chair. "I was in college then. I am older now."</p><p>康普双眼睁得老大，几乎坐不住了。“那是我在大学时代的活动，如今我已不再年轻。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not too old. Not yet thirty-five. Consequently you are going to follow Trevize, Councilman. Where he goes, you will follow, and you will report back to me. You will leave soon after Trevize does, and he will be leaving in a few hours. If you refuse the task, Councilman, you will be imprisoned for treason. If you take the ship that we will provide for you, and if you fail to follow, you need not bother coming back. You will be shot out of space if you try."</p><p>“也不算太老，还不到三十五岁。因此，议员，我决定派你去跟踪崔维兹。不论他到哪里，你都要紧紧跟着他，并且随时向我报告。崔维兹几小时后便要出发，在他升空之后，你要马上行动。假如你拒绝这项任务，议员，你就会因叛乱罪下狱。假如你登上太空船，却把崔维兹跟丢了，那你就不必再回来。你若试图硬闯，在外太空就会被击毁。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Compor rose sharply- to his feet. "! have a life to live. I have work to do. I have a wife. I cannot leave it all."</p><p>康普陡然跳了起来。“我有我自己的生活，有我自己的工作，我还有家室，我不能离开这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You will have to. Those of us who choose to serve the Foundation must be prepared at ail times to serve it in a prolonged and uncomfortable fashion, if that should become necessary."</p><p>“你必须走。我们这些志愿为基地效命的人，随时都要准备接受各种任务，即使是分外的、艰苦的工作，也应该甘之如饴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My wife must go with me, of course."</p><p>“我太太当然得跟我一道走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you take me for an idiot? She stays here, of course."</p><p>“你当我是白痴吗？她当然得留下来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As a hostage?"</p><p>“做人质吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you like the word. I prefer to say that you will be taking yourself into danger and my kind heart wants her to stay here where she will not be in danger. -There is no room for discussion. You are as much under arrest as Trevize is, and I am sure you understand I must act quickly - before the euphoria enveloping Terminus wears off. I fear my star will soon be in the descendant."</p><p>“你喜欢这么说也无妨。我倒宁可说，因为你要去从事一件危险的任务，我仁慈的心肠不忍让她一道去冒险，所以才要她留下来。没有讨价还价的余地，你现在的处境和崔维兹一模一样。我相信你应该了解，我必须尽速采取行动。端点星上的陶醉气氛不久便要耗光，我担心自己的福星很快就不再高照。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>4</p><p>4</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell said, "You were not easy on him, Madam Mayor."</p><p>柯代尔说：“你对他很不客气，市长女士。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Mayor said with a sniff, "Why should I have been? He betrayed a friend."</p><p>市长嗤之以鼻：“我为什么该对他客气？他出卖了朋友。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That was useful to us."</p><p>“他那样做对我们有好处啊。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, as it happened. His next betrayal, however, might not be."</p><p>“对，这次有好处。然而，下一次可能就刚好相反。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why should there be another?"</p><p>“为什么还有下一次呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come, Liono," said Branno impatiently, "don't play games with me. Anyone who displays a capacity for double-dealing must forever be suspected of being capable of displaying it again."</p><p>“得了吧，里奥诺，”布拉诺不耐烦地说，“少跟我来这一套。任何人表现了一次卖友求荣的本事，我们都得提防他一辈子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He may use the capability to combine with Trevize once again. Together, they may……"</p><p>“他可能用这种本事再度联合崔维兹。他们两人联手，也许就会……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You don't believe that. With all his folly and naivete, Trevize goes straight for his goal. He does not understand betrayal and he will never, under any circumstances, trust Compor a second time."</p><p>“你自己也不相信这句话。像崔维兹那种既愚蠢又天真的角色，只知道瞄准目标勇往直前。他根本不懂得耍阴谋，从今以后，不论在任何情况之下，他都不会再信任康普了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell said, "Pardon me, Mayor, but let me make sure I follow your thinking. How far, then, can you trust Compor? How do you know he will follow Trevize and report honestly? Do you count on his fears for the welfare of his wife as a restraint? His longing to return to her?"</p><p>柯代尔又说：“对不起，市长，我想确定一下是否搞懂了你的想法。这样说来，你自己又能相信康普几分呢？你如何肯定他会老老实实地跟踪崔维兹，并且随时报回？你是否算准了他毫无选择余地，因为他担心老婆的安危，因为他想回到她的怀抱？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Both are factors, but I don't entirely rely on that. On Compor's ship there will be a hyper-relay. Trevize would suspect pursuit and would search for one. However Compor - being the pursuer-will, I assume, not suspect pursuit and will not search for one. -Of course, if he does, and if he finds it, then we must depend on the attractions of his wife."</p><p>“两者都是重要的因素，但我并不完全指望这些。在康普的太空船上，会有一个超波中继器。崔维兹会怀疑有人跟踪，所以会搜查自己的太空船。然而，康普身为一名跟踪者，我猜他不会怀疑还有黄雀在后，所以不太可能发现那个装置。当然，如果他着手寻找，而且找到了，那时我们就得仰赖他老婆的魅力了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kodell laughed. "To think I once had to give you lessons. And the purpose of the pursuit?"</p><p>柯代尔哈哈大笑。“真难想象以前我还得为你上课呢。那么，跟踪到底是为了什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A double layer of protection. If Trevize is caught, it may be that Compor will carry on and give us the information that Trevize will not be able to."</p><p>“作为一种双重保障。如果崔维兹被抓到了，也许康普能够接替他的工作，继续提供我们所需要的情报。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"One more question. What if, by some chance, Trevize finds the Second Foundation, and we learn of it through him, or through Compor, or if we gain reason to suspect its existence-despite the deaths of both?"</p><p>“还有一个问题。如果说，崔维兹竟然找到了第二基地，也回报给我们，或者也许是康普报告的，或者他们两人都遇难了，我们却获得充分的证据，足以怀疑第二基地的存在，那又该怎么办？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm hoping the Second Foundation does exist, Liono," she said. "In any case, the Seldon Plan is not going to serve us much longer. The great Hari Seldon devised it in the dying days of the Empire, when technological advance had virtually stopped. Seldon was a product of his times, too, and however brilliant this semimythical science of psychohistory must have been, it could not rise out of its roots. It surely would not allow for raid technological advance. The Foundation has been achieving that, especially in this last century. We have mass-detection devices of a kind undreamed of earlier, computers that can respond to thought, and-most of all-mental shielding. The Second Foundation cannot control us for much longer, if they can do so now. I want, in my final years in power, to be the one to start Terminus on a new path."</p><p>“我倒希望第二基地的确存在，里奥诺。”她说，“无论如何，谢顿计划不能再帮我们多久了。伟大的哈里·谢顿拟定这套计划的时候，帝国已经奄奄一息，当时科技的发展几乎等于零。谢顿总也是时代的产物，不管心理史学这门近乎神话的科学有多么灵光，也一定有局限性，必定无法容纳迅速进展的科技。然而，基地的科技发展就是如此神速，尤其是过去这一个世纪。我们现在所拥有的质量侦测仪，是前人做梦也想不到的；我们的电脑已经能够靠思想控制；此外，还有一项最重要的发明，那就是精神防护罩。第二基地即使现在还能控制我们，也不能再维持多久。在我掌权的最后这几年，我要将端点星带上一条新轨。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And if there is, in fact, no Second Foundation?"</p><p>“假如事实上，根本没有第二基地呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then we start on a new path at once."</p><p>“那我们就立刻跃上那条新轨。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>5</p><p>5</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The troubled sleep that had finally come to Trevize did not last long. A touch on his shoulder was repeated a second time.</p><p>崔维兹好不容易才睡着一会儿，不多久便感觉有人在推他的肩膀，一次又一次。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize started up, bleary and utterly failing to understand why he should be in a strange bed. "What - What-?"</p><p>他猛然惊醒，睡眼惺忪，搞不懂自己为何躺在一张陌生的床上。“怎么……怎么……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat said to him apologetically, "I'm sorry, Councilman Trevize. You are my guest and I owe you rest, but the Mayor is here." He was standing at the side of the bed in flannel pajamas and shivering slightly. Trevize's senses leaped to a weary wakefulness and he remembered.</p><p>裴洛拉特带着歉意说：“我很抱歉，崔维兹议员。你是我的客人，我该让你好好睡个觉，不过市长已经来了。”他站在床边，穿着一套法兰绒的睡衣，身子好像有点颤抖。崔维兹勉强清醒过来，这才想起到底是怎么回事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Mayor was in Pelorat's living room, looking as composed as always. Kodell was with her, rubbing lightly at his white mustache.</p><p>市长坐在裴洛拉特的起居室，看起来仍是一副气定神闲的模样。柯代尔也跟她一块来了，正在轻抚着自己的白胡子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize adjusted his sash to the proper snugness and wondered how long the two of them-Branno and Kodell - were ever apart.</p><p>崔维兹调整了一下宽腰带，突然冒出一个疑问：布拉诺和柯代尔两人，到底有没有真正分开的时候？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said mockingly, " Has the Council recovered yet? Are its members concerned over the absence of one of them?"</p><p>他用揶揄的口吻说：“议会的元气恢复了？议员们开始关切失踪的同仁了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Mayor said, "There are signs of life, yes, but not enough to do you any good. There is no question but that I still have the power to force you to leave. You will be taken to Ultimate Spaceport……"</p><p>市长答道：“是的，议会恢复了一点生气，可是还不足以帮得了你。毫无疑问，我仍然有权力强迫你离去。你将被带到终极太空航站……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not Terminus Spaceport, Madam Mayor? Am I to be deprived of a proper farewell from weeping thousands?"</p><p>“不是端点太空航站吗，市长女士？连我接受上千民众含泪送别的机会，你都要剥夺吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I see you have recovered your penchant for teenage silliness, Councilman, and I am pleased. It stills what might otherwise be a certain rising twinge of conscience. At Ultimate Spaceport, you and Professor Pelorat will leave quietly."</p><p>“我发现你又恢复了少年人的稚气，议员。这令我感到高兴，否则我会觉得有些良心不安。到达终极太空航站之后，你和裴洛拉特教授将悄悄离去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And never return?"</p><p>“一去不回吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And perhaps never return. Of course," and here she smiled briefly, "if you discover something of so great an importance and usefulness that even I will be glad to have you back with your information, you will return. You may even be treated with honor."</p><p>“也许就一去不回。当然啦，”她浅浅一笑，“假如你发现了什么非常重要、非常有用的东西，以致于连我都乐于见到你带回这些情报，你就可以返回此地，甚至还会受到英雄式的欢迎。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize nodded casually, "That may happen."</p><p>崔维兹漫不经心地点了点头。“这是有可能的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Almost anything may happen. -In any case, you will be comfortable. You are being assigned a recently completed pocket-cruiser, the Far Star, named for Hober Mallow's cruiser. One person can handle it, though it will hold as many as three with reasonable comfort."</p><p>“几乎任何事都是有可能的。无论如何，这将是一趟很舒适的旅程。我们拨给你的航具，是最近才研发成功的袖珍型太空艇远星号，这是为了纪念侯伯·马洛当年那艘太空艇。它只需要一个人驾驶，不过内部空间足够舒舒服服容纳三个人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize was jolted out of his carefully assumed mood of light irony. "Fully armed?"</p><p>崔维兹原本故意摆出玩世不恭的样子，此时突然板起脸孔。“全副武装吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Unarmed but otherwise fully equipped. Wherever you go, you will be citizens of the Foundation and there will always be a consul to whom you can turn, so you will not require arms. You will be able to draw on funds at need. -Not unlimited funds, I might add."</p><p>“没有武装，除此之外一应俱全。不管你们到哪里去，你们都是基地公民，随时能向我们的驻外领事求助，所以你们无需武器。有需要的时候，你们可以动用联邦基金——我必须先声明，并非毫无限制。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You are generous."</p><p>“你好大方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know that, Councilman. But, Councilman, understand me. You are helping Professor Pelorat search for Earth. Whatever you think you are searching for, you are searching for Earth. All whom you meet must understand that. And always remember that the Far Star is not armed."</p><p>“这点我也知道，议员。不过，议员，请你弄清楚我的意思。你是去协助裴洛拉特教授寻找地球，在你自己的脑袋里，也只有地球这一个目标。不论你遇到任何人，都必须让他们了解这件事。此外，千万别忘记远星号毫无武装。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am searching for Earth;" said Trevize. "I understand that perfectly."</p><p>“我是前去寻找地球的，”崔维兹说，“我完全了解这一点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then you will go now."</p><p>“那么你们现在可以走了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Pardon me, but surely there is more to all of this than we have discussed. I have piloted ships in my time, but I have had no experience with a late-model pocket-cruiser. What if I cannot pilot it?"</p><p>“对不起，但是显然还有点事我们没讨论到。我的确驾驶过太空船，但是我对最新型的袖珍太空艇毫无经验。万一我不会驾驶，那怎么办？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am told that the Far Star is thoroughly computerized. -And before you ask, you don't have to know how to handle a late-model ship's computer. It will itself tell you anything you need to know. Is there anything else you need?"</p><p>“据我所知，远星号的一切完全电脑化。我知道你要问什么，你不必知道如何操作一艘最新型太空艇上的电脑，你想知道的任何事它都会告诉你。还需要些什么吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize looked down at himself ruefully. "A change of clothing."</p><p>崔维兹以哀伤的目光，低头打量了自己一下。“我想换件衣服。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You will find them on board ship. Including those girdles you wear, or sashes, whichever they are called. The professor is also supplied with what he needs. Everything reasonable is already aboard, although I hasten to add that this does not include female companions."</p><p>“在那艘太空艇上，你可以找到各种衣物。包括你穿的这种束腰，或者叫宽腰带，不管它叫什么，反正都不缺。教授所需要的一切也全准备好了，该有的东西太空艇上都有。不过我得补充一句，并不包括女伴在内。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Too bad," said Trevize. "It would be pleasant, but then, I have no likely candidate at the moment, as it happens. Still, I presume the Galaxy is populous and that once away from here I may do as I Please."</p><p>“太糟了，”崔维兹说，“否则会更有趣。不过嘛，此刻我也刚好没有适当人选。话说回来，想必银河处处有佳人，一旦离开此地，我就可以随心所欲了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"With regard to companions? Suit yourself."</p><p>“女伴吗？这个随你的便。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She rose heavily. "I will not take you to the spaceport," she said, "but there are those who will, and you must make no effort to do anything you are not told to do. I believe they will kill you if you make an effort to escape. The fact that I will not be with them will remove any inhibition."</p><p>她缓缓起身。“我不送你们到太空航站了，”她说，“自然会有人送你们去。千万不要试图擅自采取任何行动，如果你想逃跑，我相信他们会马上杀掉你。我既然不在场，就不会有任何人能阻止。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "I will make no unauthorized effort, Madam Mayor, but one thing……"</p><p>崔维兹说：“我绝对不会轻举妄动，市长女士，但还有一件事……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes?"</p><p>“什么事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize searched his mind rapidly and finally said with a smile that he very much hoped looked unforced, "The time may come, Madam Mayor, when you will ask me for an effort. I will then do as I choose, but I will remember the past two days."</p><p>崔维兹心念电转，最后终于带着笑容说出一番话：“总有一天，市长女士，你会求我伸出援手。那时我会依照自己的决定行事，但我不会忘记过去这两天的遭遇。”他非常希望这个笑容看起来毫不勉强。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mayor Branno sighed. "Spare me the melodrama. If the time comes, it will come, but for now-I am asking for nothing."</p><p>布拉诺市长叹了一声。“省省这些戏剧性的台词吧。如果真有这么一天，该来的总是要来，不过目前——我什么也不必求你。”</p></div>
