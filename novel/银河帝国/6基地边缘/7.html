<div class='layout'><p>CHAPTER SEVEN FARMER</p><p>第7章 农夫</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>STOR GENDIBAL JOGGED ALONG THE COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY. It was not common practice for Second Foundationers to venture into the farming world of Trantor. They could do so, certainly, but when they did, they did not venture either far or for long.</p><p>史陀·坚迪柏正沿着大学外围的乡间小路慢跑。通常，第二基地分子很少到川陀的农业世界冒险。他们当然可以这样做，不过他们出来的时候，绝不会走得太远，也不会耽搁太久。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal was an exception and he had, in times past, wondered why. Wondering meant exploring his own mind, something that Speakers, in particular, were encouraged to do. Their minds were at once their weapons and their targets, and they had to keep both offense and defense well honed.</p><p>坚迪柏却是个例外，过去他也经常寻思为何如此。寻思的意思就是探索自己的心灵，这是发言者日常的重要功课。他们的心灵兼具矛与盾的功能，必须随时锻炼攻击与防御的能力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal had decided, to his own satisfaction, that one reason he was different was because he had come from a planet that was both colder and more massive than the average inhabited planet. When he was brought to Trantor as a boy (through the net that was quietly cast throughout the Galaxy by agents of the Second Foundation on the lookout for talent), he found himself, therefore, in a lighter gravitational field and a delightfully mild climate. Naturally he enjoyed being in the open more than some of the others might.</p><p>至于他为何与众不同，坚迪柏帮自己找到的满意答案，是他出身于一个特殊的世界，那里比一般的住人行星更为寒冷，而且质量更大。十岁那年，他被（第二基地在整个银河悄悄布下的寻才网络）带到川陀来的时候，便发现川陀的重力场较弱，而且气候温和宜人。因此，他自然比其他人更喜欢到户外来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In his early years on Trantor, he grew conscious of his puny, undersized frame, and he was afraid that settling back into the comfort of a benign world would turn him flabby indeed. He therefore undertook a series of self-developing exercises that had left him still puny in appearance but kept hint wiry and with a good wind. Part of his regimen were these long walks arid joggings-about which some at the Speaker's Table muttered. Gendibal disregarded their chattering.</p><p>他来到川陀之后，就意识到自己的身材瘦弱矮小，担心在这个温暖舒适的世界住久了，会变成温室里的花朵。因此，他一直规定自己做许多运动。经过多年持之以恒的锻炼，虽然身材仍旧矮小，他却练就一身铜筋铁骨与庞大的肺活量。慢跑与散步便是他的两大健身秘诀，关于这一点，已经有发言者在圆桌会议上说闲话，坚迪柏却完全置之不理。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He kept his own ways, despite the fact that he was first-generation. All the others at the Table were second- and third-generation, with parents and grandparents who had been Second Foundationers. And they were all older than he, too. What, then, was to be expected but muttering?</p><p>他始终我行我素，从不顾虑自己只是个“第一代”，而圆桌会议的其他成员，一律是第二或第三代，换句话说，他们的父祖辈已经是第二基地分子。此外，他们也全部比他年长，所以除了招惹闲话，他还能指望得到什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By long custom, all minds at the Speaker's Table were open (supposedly altogether, though it was a rare Speaker who didn't maintain a comer of privacy somewhere-in the long run, ineffectively, of course) and Gendibal knew that what they felt was envy. So did they; just as Gendibal knew his own attitude was defensive, overcompensating ambition. And so did they.</p><p>根据一项悠久传统，在发言者圆桌会议上，所有的心灵都必须敞开。理论上是要完全敞开，不过实际上，鲜有发言者不保留一个隐私的角落。久而久之，这项传统当然便形同虚设。因此，坚迪柏知道他们感到的是嫉妒，而他们自己也心知肚明；正如同坚迪柏了解自己旺盛的企图心是出于自卫和过度补偿的心理，而这点他们也一清二楚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Besides (Gendibal's mind reverted to the reasons for his ventures into the hinterland) he had spent his childhood in a whole world-a large and expansive one, with grand and variegated scenery-and in a fertile valley of that world, surrounded by what he believed to be the most beautiful mountain ranges in the Galaxy. They were unbelievably spectacular in the grim winter of that world. He remembered his former world and the glories of a now-distant childhood. He dreamed about it often. How could he bring himself to be confined to a few dozen square miles of ancient architecture?</p><p>此外，（坚迪柏的思绪又回到他喜欢出来冒险的原因）自己的童年在一个无拘无束的世界度过。那是个广大开阔的世界，拥有壮观而变化多端的自然景观。他的家乡位于一个肥沃的谷地，在他心目中，谷地周围的山脉是全银河最最美丽的。每当酷寒的冬季，群山更显现出难以想象的壮丽景色。故乡世界的风貌，以及遥远的童年美景，他至今记忆犹新，而且常在梦中重温昔日的欢乐。所以说，他怎能让自己关在几十平方英里大的古代建筑中？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked about disparagingly as he jogged. Trantor was a mild and pleasant world, but it was not a rugged and beautiful one. Though it was a farming world, it was not a fertile planet.</p><p>他一面跑，一面以轻蔑的目光四处打量。川陀是个温和舒适的世界，却缺少了壮美的崎岖地貌。虽然是个农业世界，但它从来不是一颗肥沃的行星。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It never had been. Perhaps that, as much as any other factor, had led to its becoming the administrative center of, first, an extensive union of planets and then of a Galactic Empire. There was no strong push to have it be anything else. It wasn't extraordinarily good for anything else.</p><p>或许就是由于这个缘故，再加上其他的因素，使得川陀成为泛银河的行政中心。当年范围广大的行星联盟，与其后涵盖整个银河的帝国，两者皆定都于此。川陀没有其他方面的优良条件，也没有强烈动机向其他方面发展。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After the Great Sack, one thing that kept Trantor going was its enormous supply of metal. It was a great mine, supplying half a hundred worlds with cheap alloy steel, aluminum, titanium, copper, magnesium - returning, in this way, what it had collected over thousands of years; depleting its supplies at a rate hundreds of times faster than the original rate of accumulation.</p><p>大浩劫之后，川陀还能撑下去的原因之一，是它所拥有的大量金属资源。这是个巨大的“矿藏”，能为五十几个世界提供廉价的钢、铝、钛、铜、镁。上万年所搜集的各种金属，就这样子流散出去，算起来，比当初积聚的速度快上几百倍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were still enormous metal supplies available, but they were underground and harder to obtain. The Hamish farmers (who never called themselves "Trantorians," a term they considered ill-omened and which the Second Foundationers therefore reserved for themselves) had grown reluctant to deal with the metal any further. Superstition, undoubtedly.</p><p>川陀仍然保存着大量金属，但全都埋在地底，不再唾手可得。那些阿姆农民（他们从来不会自称“川陀人”，认为那是不吉利的名字，因此第二基地分子将它保留给自己）不愿意再打金属的主意，而这无疑是出于迷信。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Foolish of them. The metal that remained underground might well be poisoning the soil and further lowering its fertility. And yet, on the other hand, the population was thinly spread and the land supported them. And there were some sales of metal, always.</p><p>他们是一群笨蛋。留在地底的金属，很可能会不断毒害土壤，使原本不肥沃的土地变得更加贫瘠。然而，另一方面，由于人口相当稀疏，再贫瘠的土地也足以养活他们。事实上，金属的买卖也从未真正中断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal's eyes roved over the fiat horizon. Trantor was alive geologically, as almost all inhabited planets were, but it had been a hundred million years, at least, since the last major geological mountain-building period had occurred. What uplands existed had been eroded into gentle hills. Indeed, many of them had been leveled during the great metal-coating period of Trantor's history.</p><p>坚迪柏的目光盘桓在平直的地平线上。就地质学而言，川陀跟绝大多数的住人世界一样，是一颗活生生的行星。可是上次大规模的造山运动期，距今至少已有一亿年的历史，因此高山已被侵蚀成低缓的丘陵。事实上，在川陀历史上所谓的金属包覆期，那些丘陵也大多遭到铲平。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Off to the south, well out of sight, was the shore of Capital Bay, and beyond that, the Eastern Ocean, both of which had been re-established after the disruption of the underground cisterns.</p><p>“首都湾”位于南方，远在目力不可及的位置，而再向南便是“东洋”。在地底水产养殖场毁坏殆尽之后，海湾与海洋遂再度重见天日。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To the north were the towers of Galactic University, obscuring the comparatively squat-but-wide Library (most of which was underground), and the remains of the Imperial Palace still farther north.</p><p>向北遥望，可以看到银河大学的尖塔建筑，相较之下低矮宽广的图书馆（大部分结构位于地底）全部被尖塔遮掩。而再往北走一点，就是皇宫的遗迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Immediately on either side were farms, on which there was an occasional building. He passed groups of cattle, goats, chickens-the wide variety of domesticated animals found on any Trantorian farm. None of them paid him any mind.</p><p>小路两旁紧邻着许多农场，其间偶尔会有一栋建筑物。他经过了许多牛群、羊群、鸡群，都是川陀农场最常见的家畜与家禽。它们的心灵一律没有注意到他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal thought casually that anywhere in the Galaxy, on any of the vast number of inhabited worlds, he would see these animals and that on no two worlds would they be exactly alike. He remembered the goats of home and his own tame nanny whom he had once milked. They were much larger and more resolute than the small and philosophical specimens that had been brought to Trantor and established there since the Great Sack. Over the inhabited worlds of the Galaxy, there were varieties of each of these animals, in numbers almost beyond counting, and there was no sophisticate on any world who didn't swear by his favorite variety, whether for meat, milk, eggs, wool, or anything else they could produce.</p><p>坚迪柏忽然想到，不论在银河哪个角落，只要是有人类居住的世界，都能看到这些动物，却没有任何两个世界的品种完全一样。他还记得家乡的那些山羊，以及自己豢养并曾挤奶的那头母羊。它们似乎比川陀的山羊大许多，个性也比较坚决；川陀上的山羊都是大浩劫之后引进的，属于体型较小、性情较为沉稳的品种。在银河各个住人世界上，每一类动物都有不同的变种，种类几乎不可胜数。而各个世界的上流社会，都发誓他们最喜欢本地品种，不论是肉类、乳品、蛋类或羊毛，都是自己家乡的最好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As usual, there were no Hamish in view. Gendibal had the feeling that the farmers avoided being seen by those whom they referred to as "scowlers" (a mispronunciation-perhaps deliberately-of the word "scholars" in their dialect). -Superstition, again.</p><p>跟往常一样，一个阿姆人也看不到。坚迪柏感到农民们是有意躲避，因为他们不愿意被所谓的“邪者”看见。他们的方言把“学者”念成“邪者”，也许还是故意的。这又是另一个迷信。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal glanced up briefly at Trantor's sun. It was quite high in the sky, but its heat was not oppressive. In this location, at this latitude, the warmth saved mild and the cold never bit. (Gendibal ever. missed the biting cold sometimes or so he imagined. He had never revisited his native world. Perhaps, he admitted to himself, because he didn't want to be disillusioned.)</p><p>坚迪柏抬头看了看川陀的太阳。现在日头已经爬得很高，但不会使人感觉闷热。在这个地带，这个纬度上，气候一向四季如春，从来没有炙人的烈日或刺骨的寒风。坚迪柏有时甚至怀念酷寒的天气，至少在想象中十分怀念。他一直没有再返回母星，大概就是不希望使美梦幻灭，这点他自己也承认。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had the pleasant feel of muscles that were sharpened and tightened to keenness and he decided he had jogged just long enough. He settled down to a walk, breathing deeply.</p><p>他全身的肌肉都感到舒畅，那是一种磨利与绷紧的感觉。他断定自己跑得够久了，便逐渐改为步行，同时做着深呼吸。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He would be ready for the upcoming Table meeting and for one last push to force a change in policy, a new attitude that would recognize the growing danger from the First Foundation and elsewhere and that would put an end to the fatal reliance on the "perfect" working of the Plan. When would they realize that the very perfection was the surest sign of danger?</p><p>对于即将召开的圆桌会议，他已经作好完善的准备。他准备发出最后一击，一举改变第二基地的政策；他要让所有的发言者了解到，第一基地与另一个对手都将带来重大威胁，还要让他们觉悟，绝不能再依赖“完美的”谢顿计划，因为那会带来致命的危险。他们究竟什么时候才能明白，完美无瑕正是一种最肯定的警讯？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Had anyone but himself proposed it, he knew, it would have gone through without trouble. As things stood now, there would be trouble, but it would go through, just the same, for old Shandess was supporting him and would undoubtedly continue to do so. He would not wish to enter the history books as the particular First Speaker under whom the Second Foundation had withered.</p><p>他心知肚明，若由其他发言者提出这个议题，绝不会遇到什么问题。而由他提出来，虽然难免会有麻烦，但最后仍旧能够过关，因为老桑帝斯会支持他，而且无疑将支持到底。桑帝斯不会希望成为历史的罪人，让第二基地毁在他这位第一发言者手里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hamish!</p><p>阿姆人！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal was startled. He became aware of the distant tendril of mind well before he saw the person. It was Hamish mind-a farmer -coarse and unsubtle. Carefully Gendibal withdrew, leaving a touch so light as to be undetectable. Second Foundation policy was very firm in this respect. The farmers were the unwitting shields of the Second Foundation. They must be left as untouched as possible.</p><p>坚迪柏猛然一惊。在看到那人之前，他早已感应到那个遥远的心灵触须。那是一个阿姆农夫的心灵，粗糙而率直。坚迪柏小心翼翼地撤回精神感应力，他仅仅轻触一下对方的心灵，不会引起任何感觉。在这方面，第二基地的规定非常严格。农民们在不知不觉间，为第二基地提供了最好的屏障，所以必须尽量避免打扰他们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No one who came to Trantor for trade or tourism ever saw anything other than the farmers, plus perhaps a few unimportant scholars living in the past. Remove the farmers or merely tamper with their innocence and the scholars would become more noticeable-with catastrophic results. (That was one of the classic demonstrations which neophytes at the University were expected to work out for themselves. The tremendous Deviations displayed on the Prime Radiant when the farmer minds were even slightly tampered with were astonishing.)</p><p>凡是到川陀来旅行或做生意的人，除了这些农民之外，顶多只能见到几个活在过去的无名学者。如果赶走这些农民，甚至只是干扰到他们纯朴的心灵，就会使学者变得引人注目，进而引发不堪设想的结果。（这是个典型的心理史学问题，初进银河大学的弟子都要自行证明一次。他们都会发现，只要稍微扰动一下农民的心灵，元光体便会显出惊人的偏逸现象。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal saw him. It was a farmer, certainly, Hamish to the core. He was almost a caricature of what a Trantorian farmer should be tall and wide, brown-skinned, roughly dressed, arms bare, dark-haired, dark-eyed, a long ungainly stride. Gendibal felt as though he could smell the barnyard about him. (Not too much scorn, he thought. Preem Palver had not minded playing the role of farmer, when that was necessary to his plans. Some farmer he was-short and plump and soft. It was his mind that had fooled the teenaged Arkady, never his body.)</p><p>现在坚迪柏看到他了，的确是一名农夫，彻头彻尾的阿姆人。他几乎是典型的川陀农夫模样——身材又高又壮，皮肤晒成褐色，衣着简陋随便，双臂裸露在外，黑头发，黑眼珠，走起路来步伐又大又不雅观。坚迪柏仿佛已能闻到一股谷仓的味道。（但不该因此蔑视对方，他这么想。当年，普芮姆·帕佛为了计划的需要，常常心甘情愿扮演农夫的角色。他又矮又胖又松垮，哪里像个农夫。他绝不是靠外表骗倒年少的艾卡蒂，而是凭借心灵的力量。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The farmer was approaching him, clumping down the road, staring at him openly-something that made Gendibal frown. No Hamish man or woman had ever looked at him in this manner. Even the children ran away and peered from a distance.</p><p>那个农夫踏着沉重的步伐走过来，大剌剌地瞪着他，令坚迪柏不禁皱起眉头。从来没有阿姆人用这种目光望着他，即使是小孩子，也会先跑得老远，才敢对他露出好奇的目光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal did not slow his own stride. There would be room enough to pass the other with neither comment nor glance and that would be best. He determined to stay away from the farmer's mind.</p><p>坚迪柏并未放慢脚步。反正路很宽，两人交会时，不必跟对方啰唆，也用不着看他一眼，而且这样最好。因此，他决定不碰触那个农夫的心灵。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal drifted to one side, but the farmer was not going to have that. He stopped, spread his legs wide, stretched out his large arms as though to block passage, and said, "Ho! Be you scowler?"</p><p>坚迪柏挪到路边，那农夫却不吃这一套，反而停了下来，张开两腿，伸出双臂，好像故意挡住去路。然后他说：“喂！你系邪者吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Try as he might, Gendibal could not refrain from sensing the wash of pugnacity in the approaching mind. He stopped. It would be impossible to attempt to pass by without conversation and that would be, in itself, a weary task. Used as one was to the swift and subtle interplay of sound and expression and thought and mentality that combined to make up the communication between Second Foundationers, it was wearisome to resort to word combination alone. It was like prying up a boulder by arm and shoulder, with a crowbar lying nearby.</p><p>虽然尽量收敛精神力量，坚迪柏仍然从欺近的心灵中，感受到好勇斗狠的狂乱情绪。他也停下脚步，现在这种态势，想要不讲几句话就走过去，已经不可能了，可是对他而言，这是一件烦人的差事。像坚迪柏这种人，早已习惯第二基地的沟通方式，也就是通过声音、表情、思想与精神状态的繁复组合，构成一种迅疾而微妙的心理语言。因此，单纯使用声音来表达意念，总是令他格外厌烦。就像是想撬起一块大石头，放着旁边的铁棍不用，偏偏要徒手行事一样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, quietly and with careful lack of emotion, "I am a scholar. Yes."</p><p>坚迪柏终于开口，他以平稳而不带一丝情绪的口气说：“没错，我正是一名学者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ho! You am a scowler. Don't we speak outlandish now? And cannot I see that you be one or am one?" He ducked his head in a mocking bow. "Being, as you be, small and weazen and pale and upnosed."</p><p>“呕！你正是一名邪者。我们现在讲外国话吗？老子看不出你系不系邪者吗？”他低下头，戏谑地一鞠躬。“你，系又小又干又苍白，鼻孔又朝天的邪者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is it you want of me, Hamishman?" asked Gendibal, unmoved.</p><p>“你想要怎么样，阿姆人？”坚迪柏镇定地问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I be titled Rufirant. And Karoll be my previous." His accent became noticeably more Hamish. His r's rolled throatily.</p><p>“老子姓氏系鲁菲南，大名系卡洛耳。”他的阿姆口音愈来愈重，舌头卷得非常厉害。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "What is it you want with me, Karoll Rufirant?"</p><p>坚迪柏问道：“你想要怎么样，卡洛耳·鲁菲南？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And how be you titled, scowler?"</p><p>“邪者，你姓啥名啥？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does it matter? You may continue to call me `scholar."'</p><p>“这有什么关系吗？你叫我‘邪者’就行了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If I ask, it matters that I be answered, little up-nosed scowler."</p><p>“老子问你，老子就要得到答案，鼻孔朝天的小小邪者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then, I am titled Stor Gendibal and I will now go about my business."</p><p>“好吧，我的姓名是史陀·坚迪柏，现在我要去办自己的事了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What be your business?"</p><p>“你要办啥事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal felt the hair prickling on the back of his neck. There were other minds present. He did not have to turn to know there were three more Hamishmen behind him. Off in the distance, there were others. The farmer smell was strong.</p><p>坚迪柏突然觉得背上的汗毛竖了起来，因为附近出现了其他心灵。他根本不必回头，就能知道后面还有三个阿姆男子，而远处还有更多人。农夫特有的味道愈来愈浓了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My business, Karoll Rufirant, is certainly none of yours."</p><p>“卡洛耳·鲁菲南，我的事当然与你无关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Say you so?" Rufirant's voice rose. "Mates, he says his business be not ours."</p><p>“你竟敢如此说？”鲁菲南提高音量，“伙计们，他说他的事同咱们无关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was a laugh from behind him and a voice sounded. "Right he be, for his business be book-mucking and 'puter-rubbing, and that be naught for true men."</p><p>身后顿时响起一阵笑声，然后传来几句话：“他说的系对的，他的事系啃书本和擦电脑，并非男子汉的工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whatever my business is," said Gendibal firmly, "I will be about it now."</p><p>“不管我的工作是什么，”坚迪柏以坚定的口吻说，“我现在要走了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And how will you do that, wee scowler?" said Rufirant.</p><p>“你打算如何走，小小邪者？”鲁菲南问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"By passing you."</p><p>“从你身边走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You would try? You would not fear arm-stopping?"</p><p>“你想试试看？你不怕遭到手臂拦阻？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"By you and all your mates? Or by you alone?" Gendibal suddenly dropped into thick Hamish dialect. "Art not feared alone?"</p><p>“你和所有的伙计一起上？还是你一个人？”坚迪柏突然改用道地的阿姆方言说，“汝不惧单打独斗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Strictly speaking, it was not proper to prod him in this manner, but it would stop a mass attack and that had to be stopped, lest it force a still greater indiscretion on his part.</p><p>严格说来，他不该这样向对方挑衅。可是这样一来，至少可以防止他们一拥而上。群殴是绝对要避免的，否则他将被迫采取更轻率的措施。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It worked. Rufirant's expression grew lowering. "If fear there be, bookboy, th'art the one to be full of it. Mates, make room. Stand back and let him pass that he may see if I be feared alane."</p><p>这句话果然生效了，鲁菲南皱起了眉头。“此地若有惧怕，蛀书虫，惧怕全在你心中。伙计们，闪开点，站到后头去，让他走过来，他将明了老子惧不惧单打独斗。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rufirant lifted his great arms and moved them about. Gendibal did not fear the farmer's pugilistic science; but there was always a chance that a goodly blow might land.</p><p>鲁菲南举起一双粗大的拳头，不停使劲挥舞着。坚迪柏并不把农夫的拳击功夫看在眼里，但仍有可能重重挨上一拳。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal approached cautiously, working with delicate speed within Rufirant's mind. Not much-just a touch, unfelt-but enough to slow reflexes that crucial notch. Then out, and into all the others, who were now gathering in greater numbers. Gendibal's Speaker mind darted back and forth with virtuosity, never resting in one mind long enough to leave a mark, but just long enough for the detection of something that might be useful.</p><p>坚迪柏谨慎地发出精神力量，迅疾接触鲁菲南的心灵。他并没有做太多手脚，只是轻轻接触一下，对方完全没有感觉，但是反射机制已经遭到抑制。然后他又将力量延伸出去，探进周围愈聚愈多的心灵中。坚迪柏的发言者心灵发挥了高超的技艺，不断迅速来回游走，在每个心灵中停留的时间恰到好处，并未留下任何痕迹，却足以侦测到是否藏有可资利用的念头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He approached the farmer catlike, watchful, aware and relieved that no one was making a move to interfere.</p><p>他轻巧而警觉地向鲁菲南逼近，注意到没有其他人准备插手，才总算松了一口气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rufirant struck suddenly, but Gendibal saw it in his mind before any muscle had begun to tighten and he stepped to one side. The blow whistled past, with little room to spare. Yet Gendibal still stood there, unshaken. There was a collective sigh from the others.</p><p>鲁菲南突然击出一拳，坚迪柏在他牵动肌肉之前，早已看清他心中的企图，得以及时闪到一旁。拳头卷着一阵风声打过来，差一点就避不开，坚迪柏却泰然自若地站在那里。人群中立时发出一连串叹息声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal made no attempt to either parry or return a blow. It would be difficult to parry without paralyzing his own arm and to return a blow would be of no use, far the farmer would withstand it without trouble.</p><p>坚迪柏未曾试图招架或还击。想要招架，难保自己的手臂不会痛得发麻，而还击则毫无用处，对方可以轻易承受他的拳头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He could only maneuver the man as though he were a bull, forcing him to miss. That would serve to break his morale as direct opposition would not.</p><p>他只能像斗牛般对付这个莽汉，让他每次都落空。如此便能渐渐挫尽对方的锐气，这是直接还手绝对无法做到的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bull-like and roaring, Rufirant charged. GendibaI was ready and drifted to one side just sufficiently to allow the farmer to miss his clutch. Again the charge. Again the miss.</p><p>鲁菲南果然像疯牛般高声怒吼，再度发动攻击。坚迪柏又及时往旁边一闪，正好让农夫扑了个空。鲁菲南又发动第三波攻势，结果照样未能得逞。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>GendibaI felt his own breath begin to whistle through his nose. The physical effort was small, but the mental effort of trying to control without controlling was enormously difficult. He could not keep it up long.</p><p>坚迪柏开始感到呼吸急促。虽然体力消耗不多，但他必须施展似有若无的精神控制力，那是极其困难的一件事。他实在撑不了多久了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said-as calmly as he could while batting lightly at Rufirant's fear-depressant mechanism, trying to rouse in a minimalist manner what must surely be the farmer's superstitious dread of scholars……"I will now go about my business."</p><p>于是他又开口，尽量以最平静的口吻说：“我要去办自己的事了。”与此同时，他轻拍着鲁菲南的“恐惧抑制机制”，试图以最不干扰其心灵的方式，唤起农夫对学者的迷信式敬畏。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rufirant's face distorted with rage, but for a moment he did not move. Gendibal could sense his thinking. The little scholar had melted away like magic. Gendibal could feel the other's fear rise and for a moment……</p><p>鲁菲南因愤怒而脸孔扭曲，一时之间却没有任何动作。坚迪柏能够感知对方的想法：小小邪者会凭空消失，好像在变戏法。此外，坚迪柏还感觉到他的恐惧逐渐增强，有那么片刻……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But then the Hamish rage surged higher and drowned the fear.</p><p>不料这个阿姆人的怒意又陡然高涨，将恐惧感瞬间淹没。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rufirant shouted, "Mates! Scowler he dancer. He do duck on nimble toes and scorns the rules of honest Hamish blow-for-blow. Seize him. Hold him. We will trade blow for blow, then. He may be firststriker, gift of me, and I-I will be last-striker."</p><p>鲁菲南大声吼道：“伙计们！这邪者会跳舞，脚趾头很滑溜，瞧不起阿姆人光明正大一拳换一拳的规矩。逮住他，抓牢他，好让老子跟他换换拳头。来者是客，他能先打老子，老子——老子再回敬他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal found the gaps among those who now surrounded him. His only chance was to maintain a gap long enough to get through, then to run, trusting to his own wind and to his ability to dull the farmers' will.</p><p>坚迪柏发现周围人群中有些空隙。他现在唯一的机会，是设法让某个空隙保持原状，以便从那道缝钻出去，然后拔腿就跑。仗着自己的肺活量，加上足以化解农民意志的精神力量，自己也许能逃过一劫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Back and forth he dodged, with his mind cramping in effort.</p><p>他不停地闪躲挪移，不断发出抑制性的精神力量。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It would rat work. There were too many of them and the necessity of abiding within the rules of Trantorian behavior was too constricting.</p><p>办不到了，对方的人实在太多，而第二基地的戒律又太严格。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He felt hands on his arms. He was held.</p><p>他感觉双臂被许多只手抓住，他被逮到了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He would have to interfere with at least a few of the minds. It would be unacceptable and his cancer would be destroyed. But his life-his very life-was at hazard.</p><p>现在，他至少得干扰几个人的心灵。这可是大忌，会葬送掉他的前途。但是他的性命——他宝贵的生命——已经岌岌可危。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How had this happened?</p><p>怎么会发生这种事？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The meeting of the Table was not complete.</p><p>圆桌会议的成员尚未到齐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not the custom to wait if any Speaker were late. Nor, thought Shandess, was the Table in a mood to wait, in any case. Stor Gendibal was the youngest and far from sufficiently aware of the fact. He acted as though youth were in itself a virtue and age a matter of negligence on the part of those who should know better. Gendibal was not popular with the other Speakers. He was not, in point of fact, entirely popular with Shandess himself. But popularity was not at issue here.</p><p>一般说来，如果有任何发言者迟到，会议仍会准时召开。而且，桑帝斯想，在场成员无论如何不愿再等下去。史陀·坚迪柏是最年轻的发言者，但是他对这个事实却不够了解。他的言行举止，在在暗示年轻就是最大的本钱，而年长者应该随时提醒自己年事已高。其他的发言者都不欣赏坚迪柏，事实上，桑帝斯自己也并非百分之百欣赏他。可是目前的问题，并不是欣赏与否。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delora Delarmi broke in on his reverie. She was looking at him out of wide blue eyes, her round face-with its accustomed air of innocence and friendliness-masking an acute mind (to all but other Second Foundationers of her own rank) and ferocity of concentration.</p><p>他的沉思被黛洛拉·德拉米打断，她正用一双又大又蓝的眼睛望着他。她的圆脸总是带着纯真友善的表情，恰好掩饰了精明的心灵（只有与她地位相同的第二基地分子看得穿）以及凶残的本性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, smiling, "First Speaker, do we wait longer?" (The meeting had not yet been formally called to order so that, strictly speaking, she could open the conversation, though another might have waited for Shandess to speak first by right of his title.)</p><p>她带着微笑说：“第一发言者，我们还要等下去吗？”由于会议尚未正式召开，因此严格说来，她的确可以首先打破沉默。不过，其他的发言者或许都会等桑帝斯先开口，因为根据头衔，他总是有这个权利。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shandess looked at her disarmingly, despite the slight breach in courtesy. "Ordinarily we would not, Speaker Delarmi, but since the Table meets precisely to hear Speaker Gendibal, it is suitable to stretch the rules."</p><p>桑帝斯以宽容的目光望着她，对她的轻微失礼并不在意。“德拉米发言者，通常我们不会再等下去。但这次召开圆桌会议，正是为了听取坚迪柏发言者的意见，最好稍微放松一点规定。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where is he, First Speaker?"</p><p>“第一发言者，他到哪里去了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That, Speaker Delarmi, I do not know."</p><p>“这一点，德拉米发言者，我并不知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi looked about the rectangle of faces. There was the First Speaker and what should have been eleven other Speakers. -Only twelve. Through five centuries, the Second Foundation had expanded its powers and its duties, but all attempts to expand the Table beyond twelve had failed.</p><p>德拉米望了望四周的脸孔。除了第一发言者，应该还有十一位发言者。也就是说，总共只有十二位。五个世纪以来，第二基地的势力与职责扩张了无数倍，但是增加圆桌会议席次的各种尝试，却始终没有成功。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Twelve it had been after Seldon's death, when the second First Speaker (Seldon himself had always been considered as having been the first of the line) had established it, and twelve it still was.</p><p>谢顿死后，第二代第一发言者（谢顿本人一向被奉为第一代第一发言者）就作出明确的规定，将发言者的名额定为十二名，从此一直沿袭至今。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Why twelve? That number divided itself easily into groups of identical size. It was small enough to consult as a whole and large enough to do work in subgroups. More would have been too unwieldy; fewer, too inflexible.</p><p>为什么是十二名呢？因为十二个人很容易等分成几组。而且这个数目不多不少，集体开会不至于乱成一团，也足够分成几组分别行事。再多一些就会大而无当，再少一点则将失去弹性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So went the explanations. In fact, no one knew why the number had been chosen-or why it should be immutable. But then, even the Second Foundation could find itself a slave to tradition.</p><p>这只不过是后人的解释罢了。事实上，谁也不知道选取这个数字的真正原因，也不懂为何应该一成不变。但即使是第二基地的成员，也难免成为传统的奴隶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It took Delarmi only a flashing moment to have her mind twiddle the matter as she looked from face to face, and mind to mind, and then, sardonically, at the empty seat-the junior seat.</p><p>当德拉米环视每一张脸孔，接触每一个心灵时，这个问题在她心中一闪即逝。最后，她以嘲讽的目光，凝视着那个空置的座位——那个地位最低的座位。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was satisfied that there was no sympathy at all with Gendibal. The young man, she had always felt, had all the charm of a centipede and was best treated as one. So far, only his unquestioned ability and talent had kept anyone from openly proposing trial for expulsion. (Only two Speakers had been impeached-but not convicted-in the hemimillennial history of the Second Foundation.)</p><p>她发现没有人对坚迪柏表示同情，这点令她十分满意。她始终觉得这个年轻人像蜈蚣一样可憎，早该一脚踩死。只是由于他具有显著的能力与才干，因此直到目前为止，还没有人公开提议将他交付审判，以取消他的发言权。在第二基地五百年的历史中，只有两位发言者遭到纠举，不过都没有被定罪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The obvious contempt, however, of missing a meeting of the Table was worse than many an offense and Delarmi was pleased to sense that the mood for trial had moved forward rather more than a notch.</p><p>今天坚迪柏无故不出席，显然是蔑视圆桌会议，这可要比其他犯众怒的举动更糟。此时，想要审判坚迪柏的意识陡然高涨，令德拉米觉得很高兴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, "First Speaker, if you do not know the whereabouts of Speaker Gendibal, I would be pleased to tell you."</p><p>她继续说：“第一发言者，您若不知坚迪柏发言者的下落，我很乐意告诉您。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Speaker?"</p><p>“请说，发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Who among us does not know that this young man" (she used no honorific in speaking of him, and it was something that everyone noted, of course) "finds business among the Hamish continually? What that business might be, I do not ask, but he is among them now and his concern with them is clearly important enough to take precedence over this Table."</p><p>“我们之间，有谁不知道这个年轻人，”她没有用正式的头衔称呼他，当然，这点大家都注意到了，“总是跟阿姆人牵扯不清？至于是些什么牵扯，我并不想过问，但他此刻正跟他们在一起，而且显然很关心他们，甚至将他们看得比圆桌会议更为重要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I believe," said another of the Speakers, "that he merely walks or jogs as a form of physical exercise."</p><p>“我相信，”另一位发言者说，“他只是到外面去散步或慢跑，做做运动而已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi smiled again. She enjoyed smiling. It cost her nothing. "The University, the Library, the Palace, and the entire region surrounding these are ours. It is small in comparison with the planet itself, but it contains room enough, I think, for physical exercise. -First Speaker, might we not begin?"</p><p>德拉米再度展露笑容，她很爱笑，反正无需任何成本。“大学、图书馆、皇宫，以及周围这一大片领域，都是我们的地盘。虽然跟整个行星比较起来，范围并不算大，可是要做做运动，我认为应该足够宽敞了。第一发言者，我们还不开始吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker sighed inwardly. He had the full power to keep the Table waiting-or, indeed, to adjourn the meeting until a time when Gendibal was present.</p><p>第一发言者在心中叹了一口气。他有全权让圆桌会议继续等待，甚至可以宣布暂时休会，直到坚迪柏出现了再说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No First Speaker could long function smoothly, however, without at least the passive support of the other Speakers and it was never wise to irritate them. Even Preem Palver had occasionally been forced into cajolery to get his way. -Besides, Gendibal's absence was annoying, even to the First Speaker. The young Speaker might as well learn he was not a law unto himself.</p><p>然而，身为第一发言者，必须得到其他发言者的支持，如果连消极的支持都没有，工作不可能会一帆风顺，因此得罪他们绝非明智之举。即使是普芮姆·帕佛，当年为了贯彻自己的计划，有时也不得不甜言蜜语一番。何况，坚迪柏的缺席确实令人恼火，连第一发言者自己都有这种感觉。这个年轻人应该受点教训，好让他知道不能为所欲为。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now, as First Speaker, he did speak first, saying, "We will begin. Speaker Gendibal has presented some startling deductions from Prime Radiant data. He believes that there is some organization that is working to. maintain the Seldon Plan more efficiently than we can and that it does so for its own purpose. We must, in his view therefore, learn more about it out of self-defense. You all have been informed of this, and this meeting is to allow you all a chance to question Speaker Gendibal, in order that we may come to some conclusion as to future policy."</p><p>因此，身为第一发言者，他率先正式发言：“我们开会吧。坚迪柏发言者从元光体资料中，推导出一些惊人的结果。他相信另外还有一个组织，以更高明的方法在维护谢顿计划，而且他们这么做，是为了他们自己。因此他的看法是，出于自卫，我们必须对这个组织多加了解。你们都已经收到这份报告，而召开这次会议的目的，正是让诸位有机会当面质询坚迪柏发言者，以便我们达成某种结论，作为未来政策的指导方针。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was, in fact, even unnecessary to say this much. Shandess held his mind open, so they all knew. Speaking was a matter of courtesy.</p><p>事实上，桑帝斯根本不必说那么多。他已经敞开自己的心灵，与会人士都能一目了然。开口发言只不过是一种礼貌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Delarmi looked about swiftly. The other ten seemed content to allow her to take on the role of anti-Gendibal spokesperson. She said, "Yet Gendibal" (again the omission of the honorific) "does not know and cannot say what or who this other organization is."</p><p>德拉米飞快环顾四周，其他十个人似乎都同意让她担任反坚迪柏的发言代表。于是她说：“但坚迪柏……”她又省掉了头衔，“并不知道也说不出那个组织是何方神圣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She phrased it unmistakably as a statement, which skirted the edge of rudeness. It was as much as to say: I can analyze your mind; you need not bother to explain.</p><p>这是一句不折不扣的直述句，而且语意已经接近无礼的程度。这句话的意思等于是说：我能分析你的心灵，你用不着费心多作解释。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker recognized the rudeness and made the swift decision to ignore it. "The fact that Speaker Gendibal" (he punctiliously avoided the omission of the honorific and did not even point up the fact by stressing it) "does not know and cannot say what the other organization is, does not mean it does not exist. The people of the First Foundation, through most of their history, knew virtually nothing about us and, in fact, know next to nothing about us now. Do you question our existence?"</p><p>第一发言者体会到她的言外之意，立刻决定不予理会。“虽然坚迪柏发言者不知道，”他一丝不苟地使用这个正式称谓，甚至并未故意加重语气来强调，“也说不出那个组织的究竟，这并不代表它不存在。第一基地的成员，在他们的历史上，大部分时间都对我们一无所知，事实上，现在也几乎不晓得我们的真相，难道你认为我们自己也不存在吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It does not follow," said Delarmi, "that because we are unknown and yet exist, that anything, in order to exist, need only be unknown." And she laughed lightly.</p><p>“虽然我们的存在是个秘密，”德拉米答道，“并不代表说，任何东西想要存在，也必须跟我们一样不为人知。”她轻轻笑了几声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"True enough. That is why Speaker Gendibal's assertion must be examined most carefully. It is based on rigorous mathematical deduction, which I have gone over myself and which I urge you all to consider. It is" (he searched for a cast of mind that best expressed his views) "not unconvincing."</p><p>“有道理。这就是为什么坚迪柏发言者的推论，必须以最审慎的态度加以检验。他的结论是基于严格的数学推导，我自己从头到尾看过一遍，我奉劝诸位也都能认真研究一下。它是，”他寻思着一个适当的心灵表达，“相当具说服力的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And this First Foundationer, Golan Trevize, who hovers in your mind but whom you do not mention?" (Another rudeness and this time the First Speaker flushed a bit.) "What of him?"</p><p>“那个第一基地人葛兰·崔维兹，他一直盘踞在您心中，您为何却只字不提？”（又一次无礼的冒犯，第一发言者这回有点光火）“他又是怎么回事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "It is Speaker Gendibal's thought that this man, Trevize, is the tool-perhaps an unwitting one-of this organization and that we must not ignore him."</p><p>第一发言者答道：“坚迪柏发言者认为这个人，崔维兹，是那个组织的工具，也许连他自己都蒙在鼓里，我们绝不能对他掉以轻心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If," said Delarmi, sitting back in her chair and pushing her graying hair backward and out of her eyes, "this organization-whatever it is - exists and if it is dangerously powerful in its mental capabilities and is so hidden, is it likely to be maneuvering so openly by way of someone as noticeable as an exiled Councilman of the First Foundation?"</p><p>“如果这个组织，”德拉米靠向椅背，将灰白的头发从眼前拨开，顺手推到脑后，“不管它是什么，如果的确存在，又具有恐怖的强大精神力量，而且如此隐密，那么，它有可能用这样公开的手段，假手一个相当抢眼的人物，一名遭到第一基地放逐的议员吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said gravely, "One would think not. And yet I have noticed something that is most disquieting. I do not understand it." Almost involuntarily he buried the thought in his mind, ashamed that others might see it.</p><p>第一发言者严肃地说：“照理应该不会。但我注意到一件令人极为不安的事，连我自己也不大了解。”他好像不知不觉将思绪埋藏起来，羞于让其他发言者看见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Each of the Speakers noted the mental action and, as was rigorously required, respected the shame. Delarmi did, too, but she did so impatiently. She said, in accordance with the required formula, "May we request that you let us know your thoughts, since we understand and forgive any shame you may feel?"</p><p>每位发言者都注意到了这个无形的举动，根据一项严格的要求，他们都对这种愧意表示尊重。德拉米也照做了，但是感到很不耐烦。然后，她遵循既定的公式说：“既然我们明白并且谅解您的愧意，可否请您让我们知道您的想法？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "Like you, I do not see on what grounds one should suppose Councilman Trevize to be a tool of the other organization, or what purpose he could possibly serve if he were. Yet Speaker Gendibal seems sure of it, and one cannot ignore the possible value of intuition in anyone who has qualified for Speaker. I therefore attempted to apply the Plan to Trevize."</p><p>于是第一发言者说：“我跟你一样，看不出有什么理由，可以假设崔维兹议员是另一个组织的工具。即使他真是工具，我也看不出他能达到什么目的。但是坚迪柏发言者好像十分肯定，而对于一位有资格担任发言者的人，我们绝对不能忽视他的直觉。因此，我做了一个尝试，将心理史学套用在崔维兹身上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To a single person?" said one of the Speakers in low voiced surprise, and then indicated his contrition at once for having accompanied the question with a thought that was clearly the equivalent of: What a fool!</p><p>“套用在单独一个人身上？”某位发言者以低沉惊讶的口气问道，同时心中伴随着一个想法，那等于是清清楚楚的一句：真是个笨蛋！但他立即表示了悔意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To a single person," said the First Speaker, "and you are right. What a fool I am! I know very well that the Plan cannot possibly apply to individuals, not even to small groups of individuals. Nevertheless, I was curious. I extrapolated the Interpersonal Intersections far past the reasonable limits, but I did it in sixteen different ways and chose a region rather than a point. I then made use of all the details we know about Trevize - a Councilman of the First Foundation does not go completely unnoticed-and of the Foundation's Mayor. I then threw it all together, rather higgledy-piggledy, I'm afraid." He paused.</p><p>“套用在单独一个人身上。”第一发言者说，“你的想法没错，我真是个笨蛋！我自己应该非常清楚，心理史学绝不可能用到个人身上，甚至对一小群人也不灵光。然而，我无法按捺自己的好奇心。我将‘人际交点’外推到超过极限很远的区域，可是我总共用了十六种不同的方法，而且选择的是一个区域，并非只是一个点。然后，我又分析了我们手中有关崔维兹的所有资料——第一基地的议员多少会受到我们的注意——此外再加上基地市长的资料。最后我将这些结果综合起来，只怕过程有些乱七八糟。”说到这里他突然住口。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>" Well?" said Delarmi. "I gather you- Were the results surprising?"</p><p>“怎么样？”德拉米追问，“我猜想您……结果出人意料之外吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There weren't any results, as you might all expect," said the First Speaker. "Nothing can be done with a single individual, and yet-and yet……"</p><p>“正如诸位预料的一样，根本没有任何结果。”第一发言者答道，“单独一个人的行为绝对无法预测，但是……但是……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And yet?"</p><p>“但是什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have spent forty years analyzing results and I have grown used to obtaining a clear feeling of what the results would be before they were analyzed-and I have rarely been mistaken. In this case, even though there were no results, I developed the strong feeling that Gendibal was right and that Trevize should not be left to himself."</p><p>“我在心理史学上花了四十年的时间，在分析任何问题之前，我都能对结果先有一个相当明确的预感，而且很少猜错。眼前这个问题，虽然没有答案，我却产生一种强烈的感觉，认为坚迪柏说对了，我们不能对崔维兹置之不理。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not, First Speaker?" asked Delarmi, clearly taken aback at the strong feeling in the First Speaker's mind.</p><p>“为什么呢，第一发言者？”德拉米问道。第一发言者心中强烈的情绪，显然令她大吃一惊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am ashamed," said the First Speaker, "that I have let myself be tempted into using the Plan for a purpose for which it is not fit. I am further ashamed now that I am allowing myself to be influenced by something that is purely intuitive. -Yet I must, for I feel this very strongly. If Speaker Gendibal is right-if we are in danger from an unknown direction-then I feel that when the time comes that our affairs are at a crisis, it will be Trevize who will hold and play the deciding card."</p><p>“我感到很羞愧，”第一发言者说，“自己竟然无法抗拒诱惑，将心理史学用在不适用的问题上。而更令我感到羞愧的是，我还允许纯粹的直觉左右我自己。但是我身不由己，因为这种感觉非常强烈。假如坚迪柏发言者说对了，如果我们正遭受到不知名的威胁，那么根据我的感觉，当我们的危机降临时，崔维兹将是扭转乾坤的决定性人物。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On what basis do you feel this?" said Delarmi, shocked.</p><p>“您这种感觉有什么根据呢？”德拉米十分惊讶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>First Speaker Shandess looked about the table miserably, "I have no basis. The psychohistorical mathematics produces nothing, but as I watched the interplay of relationships, it seemed to me that Trevize is the key to everything. Attention must be paid to this young man."</p><p>第一发言者桑帝斯愁眉苦脸地环视众人。“我毫无根据，心理史学的数学没有给出任何结果。可是我观察各种关系的交互作用，便感到崔维兹是一切事物的关键。对这个年轻人，我们一定要密切注意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal knew that he would not get back in time to join the meeting of the Table. It might be that he would not get back at all.</p><p>坚迪柏心里明白，他无法及时赶回参加圆桌会议，还有可能永远回不去了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was held firmly and he tested desperately about him to see how he could best manage to force them to release him.</p><p>他的四肢都被牢牢抓住，但他仍然拼命测试四周的心灵，试图找出迫使他们释放自己的最佳方案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rufirant stood before him now, exultant. "Be you ready now, scowler? Blow for blow, strike for strike, Hamish-fashion. Come then, art the smaller; strike then first."</p><p>这时，鲁菲南正站在他面前耀武扬威。“邪者，你准备好没？一拳换一拳，一掌换一掌，阿姆传统方式。来吧，你个子小，你先来打。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "Will someone hold thee, then, as I be held?"</p><p>坚迪柏说：“那么，是否有人同样抓住阁下？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rufirant said, "Let him go. Nah nah. His arms alane. Leave arms free, but hold legs strong. We want no dancing."</p><p>鲁菲南则说：“放开他。非也非也，光放开手臂，让他能挥动拳头。两只脚要抓牢，我们不要他再跳舞。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal felt himself pinned to the ground. His arms were free.</p><p>坚迪柏觉得双脚好像钉在地上，但是两只手可以活动了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Strike, scowler," said Rufirant. "Give us a blow."</p><p>“打呀，邪者。”鲁菲南说，“打一拳给咱们看。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then Gendibal's probing mind found something that answered - indignation, a sense of injustice and pity. He had no choice; he would have to run the risk of outright strengthening and then improvising on the basis of There was no need! He had not touched this new mind, yet it reacted as he would have wished. Precisely.</p><p>此时，坚迪柏向四处探出的精神感应，突然间发现一个合适的心灵，其中充满着愤怒、不平与怜悯的情绪。他毫无选择余地，必须冒险增强精神力量，然后随机应变……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He suddenly became aware of a small figure-stocky, with long, tangled black hair and arms thrust outward-careening madly into his field of view and pushing madly at the Hamish farmer.</p><p>他随即发觉没有这个必要！他尚未碰触这个新出现的心灵，它的反应却和他的预期一样，完全一模一样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The figure was that of a woman. Gendibal thought grimly that it was a measure of his tension and preoccupation that he had not noted this till his eyes told him so.</p><p>他眼前突然出现一个较小的身形——结实健壮，一头黑发又长又乱，两只手臂举在前面——疯狂地冲过来，疯狂地推开那名阿姆农夫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>那是一个女人。由于坚迪柏太过紧张，一心一意只想脱困，因此刚才浑然不觉，直到现在才凭视觉发现她是女人。想到这里，他不禁埋怨起自己来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Karoll Rufirant!" She shrieked at the farmer. "Art bully and coward! Strike for strike, Hamish-fashion? You be two times yon scowler's size. You'll be in more sore danger attacking me. Be there renown in pashing yon poor spalp? There be shame, I'm thinking. It will be a fair heap of finger-pointing and there'll be full saying, `Yon be Rufirant, renowned baby-smasher.' It'll be laughter, I'm thinking, and no decent Hamishman will be drinking with you-and no decent Hamishwoman will be ought with you."</p><p>“卡洛耳·鲁菲南！”她对农夫尖声叫道，“系大欺小的懦夫！一拳换一拳，哪门子阿姆传统方式？你系那邪者的两倍大，你打我都比打他危险多。揍一顿那可怜小子你很有名望吗？我想你不要脸。会有一大堆人指着你鼻子，大家全会说：‘那边有个鲁菲南，出了名的大欺小。’我想人人会笑你，再没一个要脸的阿姆男子会跟你喝酒，再没一个要脸的阿姆女子会跟你有牵扯。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rufirant was trying to stem the torrent, warding off the blows she was aiming at him, attempting weakly to answer with a placating, "Now, Sura. Now, Sura."</p><p>鲁菲南忙着阻止这一轮猛攻，一面挡开她落下的拳头，一面不停地讨饶：“好啦，苏拉。好啦，苏拉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal was aware that hands no longer grasped him, that Rufirant no longer glared at him, that the minds of all were no longer concerned with him.</p><p>坚迪柏感到抓着自己的手通通松掉了，鲁菲南不再对他横眉竖眼，每个人的心思都从他身上移开。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sura was not concerned with him, either; her fury was concentrated solely on Rufirant. Gendibal, recovering, now looked to take measures to keep that fury alive and to strengthen the uneasy shame flooding Rufirant's mind, and to do both so lightly and skillfully as to leave no mark. Again, there was no need.</p><p>苏拉同样没有理睬他，她的怒火全部集中在鲁菲南身上。坚迪柏此时回过神来，开始设想怎样才能一直维持那股怒火，并且更加增强鲁菲南心中的羞愧，而两者必须做得恰到好处，不能留下丝毫痕迹。不过，他再度发现这根本没有必要。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The woman said, "All of you back-step. Look here. If it be not sufficient that this Karoll-heap be like giant to this starveling, there must be five or six more of you ally-friends to share in shame and go back to farm with glorious tale of dewing-do in baby-smashing. `I held the spalp's arm,' you'll say, `and giant Rufirant-block pashed him in face when he was not to back-strike.' And you'll say, `But I held his foot, so give me also-glory.' And Rufirant-chunk will say, `I could not have kiln on his lane, so my furrow-mates pinned him and, with help of all six, I gloried on him.""</p><p>那女人又骂道：“你们全站远点，听好。假若大块头卡洛耳还对付不了这个营养不良的家伙，你们这五六个狐群狗党一定一起不要脸。你们等一下回到农场，一定会大大吹嘘这件大欺小的英勇行为。你会说：‘我抓住那小子的手臂，大块头鲁菲南打他的脸，他不敢还手。’你会说：‘可是我负责抓他的脚，所以光荣也有我一份。’大块头鲁菲南会说：‘我没法子逮到他，所以我的农友把他抓牢，有他们六个帮忙，我就在他身上获得胜利。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But Sura," said Rufirant, almost whining, "1 told scowler he might have first-shrike."</p><p>“可是苏拉，”鲁菲南以近乎呜咽的声音说，“我告诉邪者，他可以先打。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And fearful you were of the mighty blows of his thin arms, not so, Rufirant thickhead. Come. Let him go where he be going, and the rest of you to your homes back-crawl, if so be those homes will still find a welcome-making for you. You had all best hope the grand deeds of this day be forgotten. And they will not be, for I be spreading them far-wide, if you do make me any the more fiercely raging than I be raging now."</p><p>“你会怕他那两只细手臂的重拳头才怪，笨头鲁菲南。好啦，让他爱到哪儿就到哪儿，你们这些人赶紧爬回家，这样你们的家还会欢迎你们。你们最好祷告今日这件伟大事迹被人忘掉，假如你们要把我的火气再升高，那么你们就甭指望，因为我一定会把这个消息传到远方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They trooped off quietly, heads hanging, not looking back.</p><p>农夫们没有再说什么，全都垂头丧气，头也不回地离开了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal stared after them, then back at the woman. She was dressed in blouse and trousers, with roughmade shoes on her feet. Her face was wet with perspiration and she breathed heavily. Her nose was rather large, her breasts heavy (as best Gendibal could tell through the looseness of her blouse), and her bare arms muscular. -But then, the Hamishwomen worked in the fields beside their men.</p><p>坚迪柏看他们走远了，才转过头来盯着那个女人。她穿着宽松的工作服与长裤，脚上套着一双粗制的鞋子，满脸都是汗水，正在使劲喘气。她的鼻子稍嫌大些，胸部很厚实（由于她穿着宽大的工作服，坚迪柏无法百分之百确定），裸露在外的双臂肌肉发达。这是当然的事，阿姆女子总是跟男人一块下田干活。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was looking at him sternly, arms akimbo. "Well, scowler, why be lagging? Go on to Place of Scowlers. Be you feared? Shall I company you?"</p><p>她双手叉腰，以严肃的目光瞪着他。“好啦，邪者，干吗拖拖拉拉？赶快回到‘邪者之地’。你惧怕吗？想我陪你走吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal could smell the perspiration on clothes that were clearly not freshly laundered, but under the circumstances it would be most discourteous to show any repulsion.</p><p>她身上的衣服显然好久没洗了，坚迪柏闻得到上面的汗酸味。但在目前的情况下，露出任何嫌恶的表情，都会是最失礼的行为。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I thank you, Miss Sura……"</p><p>“我很感谢你，苏拉小姐……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The name be Novi," she said gruffly. "Sura Novi. You may say Novi. It be unneeded to moresay."</p><p>“我的姓氏系诺微，”她粗声说，“全名苏拉·诺微。你可以叫我诺微，不必多加什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I thank you, Novi. You have been very helpful. You be welcome to company me, not for fear o&euro; mine but for company-pleasure in you." And he bowed gracefully, as he might have bowed to one of the young women at the University.</p><p>“我很感谢你，诺微，你帮了我一个大忙。欢迎你陪我走一趟，并非系我惧怕，系有你作伴我感到荣幸。”他优雅地鞠了一个躬，如同对大学里的女郎致意一般。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novi flushed, seemed uncertain, and then tried to imitate his gesture. "Pleasure-be mine," she said, as though searching for words that would adequately express her pleasure and lend an air of culture.</p><p>诺微涨红了脸，似乎不知所措，只好也模仿他的动作。“荣幸，系我的。”她仿佛在脑海中翻找许久，才找到这句足以表达喜悦，又显得很有教养的话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They walked together. Gendibal knew well that each leisurely step made him the more unforgiveably late for the Table meeting, but by now he had had a chance to think on the significance of what had taken place and he was icily content to let the lateness grow.</p><p>于是他们一道往回走。坚迪柏很明白，每跨出悠闲的一步，就代表他会在圆桌会议上多迟到几秒钟，这是不可饶恕的行为。但是他现在有很好的机会，可以想想刚才的变故究竟有何深意，因此他镇定异常，并不在意时间一分一秒溜走。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The University buildings were looming ahead of them when Sura Novi stopped and said hesitantly, "Master Scowler?"</p><p>当大学的建筑遥遥在望之际，苏拉·诺微停下脚步，以迟疑的口气说：“邪者师傅？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Apparently, Gendibal thought, as she approached what she called the "Place of Scowlers," she grew mare polite. He had a momentary urge to say, "Address you not yon poor spalp?" -But that would embarrass her beyond reason.</p><p>坚迪柏想，显然是因为渐渐接近她口中的“邪者之地”，她的谈吐因此愈来愈文雅。他心中突然冒出一个冲动，想要说：“你不再叫我可怜小子？”可是那会害得她无地自容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Novi?"</p><p>“什么事，诺微？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Be it very fine like and rich in Place of Scowlers?"</p><p>“邪者之地非常美观、非常豪华吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's nice," said Gendibal.</p><p>“是很不错。”坚迪柏说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I once dreamed I be in Place. And-and I be scowler."</p><p>“我曾经做梦我在邪者之地，而且……而且我系一个邪者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Someday," said Gendibal politely, "I'll show it thee."</p><p>“改天，”坚迪柏客气地说，“我带你参观一下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her look at him showed plainly she didn't take it for mere politeness. She said, "I can write. I be taught by schoolmaster. If I write letter to thee," she tried to make it casual, "how do I mark it so it come to thee?"</p><p>由她望向他的眼神，看得出她绝不认为那只是客气话。“我会写字，学校师傅教过我。假如我写信给你，”她假装只是随口问问，“我该怎样标示，才能到你手上？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Just say, `Speaker's House, Apartment 27,' and it will come to me. But I must go, Novi."</p><p>“只要写‘发言者之家，第二十七栋’，我就能收到。但我得赶紧走了，诺微。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He bowed again, and again she tried to imitate the action. They moved off in opposite directions and Gendibal promptly put her out of his mind. He thought instead of the Table meeting and, in particular, of Speaker Delora Delarmi. His thoughts were not gentle.</p><p>他再向她鞠了一躬，而她又试着模仿了一次那个动作，两人就往相反的方向分道扬镳。坚迪柏很快便将她从心头挥去，现在他心中只有圆桌会议，尤其是黛洛拉·德拉米发言者。想到这里，他的心情突然分外沉重。</p></div>
