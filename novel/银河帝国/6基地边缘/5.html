<div class='layout'><p>CHAPTER FIVE SPEAKER</p><p>第5章 发言者</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>TRANTOR!</p><p>川陀！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For eight thousand years, it was the capital of a large and mighty political entity that spanned an ever-growing union of planetary systems. For twelve thousand years after that, it was the capital of a political entity that spanned the entire Galaxy. It was the center, the heart, the epitome of the Galactic Empire.</p><p>曾经有八千年的岁月，银河中一个强大的政治实体以它为首府。这个政体不断对外扩张，形成一个愈来愈庞大的行星系联盟。之后的一万两千年，一个掌控整个银河的政权定都于此，川陀就是银河帝国的中枢、心脏与缩影。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was impossible to think of the Empire without thinking of Trantor.</p><p>任何人想到帝国，绝不可能不联想到川陀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trantor did not reach its physical peak until the Empire was far gone in decay. In fact, no one noticed that the Empire had lost its drive, its forward look, because Trantor gleamed in shining metal.</p><p>帝国走了很长一段下坡路之后，川陀的物质文明才攀上巅峰。事实上，由于川陀表面的金属始终灿烂耀眼，当时谁也没注意到帝国业已失去原动力，前途已经毫无希望。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Its growth had peaked at the point where it was a planet-girdling city. Its population was stabilized (by law) at forty-five billion and the only surface greenery was at the Imperial Palace and the Galactic University/Library complex.</p><p>当川陀变成一个环球都会时，它的发展达到了极致。此时人口总数（依法）固定在四百五十亿，而行星表面唯一的绿地，只剩下皇宫的所在地，以及“银河大学／图书馆”的复合体。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trantor's land surface was metal-coated. Its deserts and its fertile areas were alike engulfed and made into warrens of humanity, administrative jungles, computerized elaborations, vast storehouses of food and replacement parts. its mountain ranges were beaten down; its chasms filled in. The city's endless corridors burrowed under the continental shelves and the oceans were turned into huge underground aquacultural cisterns-the only (and insufficient native source of food and minerals.</p><p>整个川陀表面皆被金属包覆，沙漠与沃土一视同仁被掩埋在金属之下。其上则是拥挤的住宅区、林林总总的行政机关、电脑化的精密工厂，以及储存粮食与零件的巨大仓库。所有的山脉皆被铲除，每一个断层都被填平，市区数不清的地下回廊一直延伸到大陆架。至于海洋，则变成巨大的地底水产养殖场，是这个世界唯一的粮食与矿物产地（当然无法自给自足）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The connections with the Outer Worlds, from which Trantor obtained the resources it required, depended upon its thousand spaceports, its ten thousand warships, its hundred thousand merchant ships, its million space freighters.</p><p>川陀所需的一切资源，绝大多数依靠与外围世界的交通。这个庞大的运输网，包括川陀的上千座太空航站、上万艘战舰、十万艘太空商船，以及百万艘太空货轮。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No city so vast was ever recycled so tightly. No planet in the Galaxy had ever made so much use of solar power or went to such extremes to rid itself of waste heat. Glittering radiators stretched up into the thin upper atmosphere upon the nightside and were withdrawn into the metal city on the dayside. As the planet turned, the radiators rose as night progressively fell around the world and sank as day progressively broke. So Trantor always had an artificial asymmetry that was almost its symbol.</p><p>银河中再也没有另一座大城市，新陈代谢如川陀这般频密，也没有任何行星的太阳能使用率超过此地，或是像它这般走极端地排放废热。在川陀世界的夜面，无数闪亮的散热器伸入稀薄的高层大气，而在另一侧的日面，同样的散热器尽数收进金属层中。随着这颗行星的自转，当某地渐渐夜幕低垂时，散热器便缓缓升起，而在黎明破晓时分，又一个接一个沉入地下。因此，川陀表面永远存在一种人工的不对称，几乎已经成为它的标志。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At this peak, Trantor ran the Empire?</p><p>在川陀的巅峰时期，它统治着整个帝国！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It ran it poorly, but nothing could have run the Empire well. The Empire was too large to be run from a single world-even under the most dynamic of Emperors. How could Trantor have helped but run it poorly when, in the ages of decay, the Imperial crown was traded back and forth by sly politicians and foolish incompetents and the bureaucracy had become a subculture of corruptibles?</p><p>它的统治不怎么样，不过也没有任何世界能将帝国治理得好。帝国实在疆域太过辽阔，无法让单一世界君临天下，即使最强而有力的皇帝也不例外。而在帝国走向败亡之际，当权者都是狡狯的政客与愚蠢无能之辈，他们将皇冠视为私相授受的囊中物，而官僚政治则发展成贪污和贿赂，在这种情况下，川陀又怎能将帝国治理得好？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But even at its worst, there was some self-propelled worth to the machinery. The Galactic Empire could not have been run without Trantor.</p><p>但即使一切跌到谷底，整个体制仍然需要一个引擎，因此，银河帝国绝对不能没有川陀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Empire crumbled steadily, but as long as Trantor remained Trantor, a core of the Empire remained and it retained an air of pride, of millennia, of tradition and power and-exaltation.</p><p>虽然帝国一步步土崩瓦解，但只要川陀仍旧是川陀，帝国的核心便依然存在，各种假象便能继续维持，诸如得意与骄傲，传统与权力，以及黄金时代。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Only when the unthinkable happened-when Trantor finally fell and was sacked; when its citizens were killed by the millions and left to starve by the billions; when its mighty metal coating was scarred and punctured and fused by the attack of the "barbarian" fleet-only then was the Empire considered to have fallen. The surviving remnants on the once-great world undid further what had been left and, in a generation, Trantor was transformed from the greatest planet the human race had ever seen to an inconceivable tangle of ruins.</p><p>意料不到的事竟然发生了，川陀终于陷落敌手，而且遭到烧杀掳掠。数百亿居民惨遭杀害，数百万幸存者面临大饥荒。“蛮子”的舰队将强固的金属表层炸得百孔千疮，甚至将许多处熔毁殆尽。直到这一天，大家才认为帝国真正灭亡。在这个曾经独步银河的世界上，幸存者为了活口，只好将剩余的金属表层逐一拆解。又过了一个世代，川陀便从人类有史以来最伟大的行星，转变成难以想象的一片废墟。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That had been nearly two and a half centuries ago. In the rest of the Galaxy, Trantor-as-it-had-been still was not forgotten. It would live forever as the favored site of historical novels, the favored symbol and memory of the past, the favored word for sayings such as "All starships land on Trantor," "Like looking for a person in Trantor," and "No more alike than this and Trantor."</p><p>“大浩劫”已经过去两百多年，但在银河其他各处的人，始终未能忘怀川陀当年的盛况。川陀永远是历史小说的热门题材，是集体记忆最珍贵的象征，也将永远保存在格言成语之中，例如“艘艘星舰落川陀”“大海捞针，川陀寻人”“这玩意跟川陀一样独一无二”等等。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In all the rest of the Galaxy - </p><p>在银河每一个角落……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But that was not true on Trantor itself! Here the old Trantor was forgotten. The surface metal seas gone, almost everywhere. Trantor was now a sparsely settled world of self-sufficient farmers, a place where trading ships rarely came and were not particularly welcome when they did come. The very word "Trantor," though still in official use, had dropped out of popular speech. By present-day Trantorians, it was called "Name," which in their dialect was what would be called "Home" in Galactic Standard.</p><p>可是唯独川陀不然！在这里，昔日的川陀已遭到遗忘，金属表层几乎完全消失。川陀现在成了一个农业世界，散居着一些自给自足的农民。难得有太空商船来到此地，即使偶尔真有一艘降落，也不见得特别受欢迎。而“川陀”这个名称，虽然正式场合仍然出现，但是在口语中已不再通用。根据今日川陀人使用的方言，这个世界称作“阿姆”，翻译成银河标准语，它的意思就是“母星”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Quindor Shandess thought of all this and much more as he sat quietly in a welcome state of half-drowse, in which he could allow his mind to run along a self-propelled and unorganized stream of thought.</p><p>这些思绪在昆多·桑帝斯的脑海中此起彼落，此外他还想到了更多更多。此时他正安稳地坐在那里，进入一种舒适的假寐状态。在这种境界中，他的心灵可以自动运作，产生许多杂乱无章的意识之流。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had been First Speaker of the Second Foundation for eighteen years, and he might well bold on for ten or twelve years more if his mind remained reasonably vigorous and if he could continue to fight the political wars.</p><p>他担任第二基地的第一发言者已有二十余年，只要他的心灵依旧强健，能够继续投入政治斗争，这个位子当然还能再坐上十年到十二年。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was the analog, the mirror image, of the Mayor of Terminus, who ruled over the First Foundation, but how different they were in every respect. The Mayor of Terminus was known to all the Galaxy and the First Foundation was therefore simply "the Foundation" to all the worlds. The First Speaker of the Second Foundation was known only to his associates.</p><p>他可算是端点市长的镜像，但是两者在各方面又大不相同。端点市长统治第一基地，威名响彻银河；对于其他世界而言，第一基地就是唯一的基地。而第二基地的第一发言者，只有身边的同僚才认识他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And yet it was the Second Foundation, under himself and his predecessors, who held the real power. The First Foundation was supreme in the realm of physical power, of technology, of war weapons. The Second Foundation was supreme in the realm of mental power, of the mind, of the ability to control. In any conflict between the two, what would it matter how many ships and weapons the First Foundation disposed of, if the Second Foundation could control the minds of those who controlled the ships and weapons?</p><p>事实上，真正掌握实权的是第二基地，而第二基地的领导人，便是历代的第一发言者。在有形力量、科技与武器的领域中，第一基地有着至高无上的成就。而在精神力量、心灵科学和心智控制这方面，第二基地无疑拥有绝对的权威。双方一旦发生冲突，就算第一基地拥有再多的星舰与武器，如果控制这些武力的人被第二基地控制着心智，一切又何足为惧？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But how long could he revel in this realization of secret power?</p><p>然而这个神秘的力量，还能再使他志得意满多久？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was the twenty-fifth First Speaker and his incumbency was already a shade longer than average. Ought he, perhaps, not be too keen on holding on and keeping out the younger aspirants? There was Speaker Gendibal, the keenest and newest at the Table. Tonight they would spend time together and Shandess looked forward to it. Ought he look forward also to Gendibal's possible accession some day?</p><p>他是第二十五代第一发言者，相较于历代第一发言者，他在位已经略微超过平均年数。他是否应当不再如此眷恋这个位子，让年轻一辈有出头的机会？例如那个坚迪柏发言者，他是圆桌会议上最新的成员，也是心灵最敏锐的一位。他们今晚将要碰面，桑帝斯欣然期待这个机会。而他是否也该欣然期待，坚迪柏有朝一日可能继任第一发言者？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The answer to the question was that Shandess had no real thought of leaving his post. He enjoyed it too much.</p><p>这个问题，标准答案是桑帝斯尚未认真考虑退位，他实在太喜欢这个职位了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He sat there, in his old age, still perfectly capable of performing his duties. His hair was gray, but it had always been light in color and he wore it cut an inch long so that the color scarcely mattered. His eyes were a faded blue and his clothing conformed to the drab styling of the Trantorian farmers.</p><p>现在，他默默坐在那里，虽然年纪一大把了，仍然能够完美地履行职务。他的头发已经灰白，可是由于发色一向很淡，又剪得只剩寸许，所以变化并不显着。此外，他的蓝眼珠也开始褪色。他一身朴素的服装，则是刻意模仿川陀农民。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker could, if he wished, pass among the Hamish people as one of them, but his hidden power nevertheless existed. He could choose to focus his eyes and mind at any time and they would then act according to his will and recall nothing about it afterward.</p><p>只要他愿意，这位第一发言者能够随意混迹阿姆人之间，不会露出任何马脚。可是，他的精神力量始终如影随形。他随时能将目光与心灵聚焦在某人身上，而那人便会遵循他的心意行事，事后根本毫无记忆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It rarely happened. Almost never. The Golden Rule of the Second Foundation was, "Do nothing unless you must, and when you must act - hesitate."</p><p>不过这种事很少发生，几乎从来没有。第二基地的金科玉律是：“什么都别做，除非万不得已；非做不可时，仍要三思而后行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker sighed softly. Living in the old University, with the brooding grandeur of the ruins of the Imperial Palace not too far distant, made one wonder on occasion how Golden the Rule might be.</p><p>想到这里，第一发言者轻叹了一声。他们生活在银河大学昔日的校园中，皇宫废墟的庄严古迹就在不远之处，偶尔环顾四周，难免令人怀疑金科玉律只是金玉其外罢了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the days of the Great Sack, the Golden Rule had been strained to the breaking point. There was no way of saving Trantor without sacrificing the Seldon Plan for establishing a Second Empire. It would have been humane to spare the forty-five billion, but they could not have been spared without retention of the core of the First Empire and that would have only delayed the reckoning. If would have led to a greater destruction some centuries later and perhaps no Second Empire ever</p><p>大浩劫发生之际，这条金科玉律差一点被放弃。想要保护川陀，必须牺牲建立第二帝国的谢顿计划。拯救四百五十亿生灵虽然符合人道，可是这样一来，第一帝国的核心就不会消失，整个计划便注定遭到延搁。数个世纪后，将会带来更大的灾难，也许第二帝国永远无法出现……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The early First Speakers had worked over the clearly foreseen Sack for decades but had found no solution-no way of assuring both the salvation of Trantor and the eventual establishment of the Second Empire. The lesser evil had to be chosen and Trantor had died!</p><p>早期几位第一发言者，曾经花了数十年光阴，研究这个早已预见的大浩劫，却苦于找不出解决之道。拯救川陀与建立第二帝国，是无法两全其美的事。两害相权取其轻，因此川陀必须毁灭！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Second Foundatianers of the time had managed-by the narrowest of margins-to save the University/Library complex and there had been guilt forever after because o&euro; that, too. Though no one had ever demonstrated that saving the complex had led to the of the Mule, there was always the intuition that there was a connection.</p><p>当时的第二基地分子，仍然冒了绝大的风险，设法把“银河大学／图书馆”保存下来，却因此带来无穷的后患。虽然从来没有人能证明，这个举动导致了骡在银河历史上的暴起，总有人直觉地认为两者必有关联。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How nearly that had wrecked everything!</p><p>差点就让一切前功尽弃！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yet following the decades of the Sack acrd the Mule came the Golden Age o&euro; the Second Foundation.</p><p>然而，经过大浩劫与骡乱的数十年动荡后，第二基地迈入黄金时代。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Prior to that, for over two and a half centuries after Seldon's death, the Second Foundation had burrowed like moles into the Library, intent only on staying out of the way of the Imperials. They served as librarians in a decaying society that cared less and less for the ever-more-misnamed Galactic Library, which fell into the desuetude that best suited the purpose of the Second Foundationers.</p><p>在此之前，亦即谢顿死后的两百五十多年间，第二基地如地鼠般躲在银河图书馆里，一心只想避开帝国的耳目。在日渐衰微的社会中，愈来愈名不符实的银河图书馆越来越不受重视，他们便以图书馆员的身份出现。这座遭人遗弃的图书馆，作为第二基地的大本营再适合不过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was an ignoble life. They merely conserved the Plan, while out at the end of the Galaxy, the First Foundation fought for its life against always greater enemies with neither help from the Second Foundation nor any real knowledge of it.</p><p>那是一种与世隔绝的生活，他们只需要全心全意保护谢顿计划。与此同时，在银河的某个端点，第一基地为了图存，必须跟一波强过一波的敌人奋战——完全未曾获得第二基地的协助，对它也几乎没有任何了解。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was the Great Sack that liberated the Second Foundation - another reason (young Gendibal - who had courage-had recently said that it was the chief reason) why the Sack was allowed to proceed.</p><p>正是大浩劫解放了第二基地，这也是第二基地默许大浩劫的另一个原因。一向勇于表达意见的年轻人坚迪柏最近曾说，其实这根本就是主因。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After the Great Sack, the Empire was gone and, in all the later times, the Trantorian survivors never trespassed on Second Foundation territory uninvited. The Second Foundationers saw to it that the University/Library complex which had survived the Sack also survived the Great Renewal. The ruins of the Palace were preserved, too. The metal was gone over almost all the rest of the world. The great and endless corridors were covered up, filled in, twisted, destroyed, ignored; all under rock and soil-all except here, where metal still surrounded the ancient open places.</p><p>经过大浩劫的洗礼，帝国正式宣告灭亡，从此之后，川陀上的幸存者从未擅自闯入第二基地的地盘。“银河大学／图书馆”既然躲过了大浩劫，第二基地更要让它免于“大复兴”的干扰，连皇宫废墟也顺便保存下来。除了这里，整个世界的金属表层几乎一块不剩。而地底无数盘根错节的巨大回廊，则全部遭到掩盖、填埋、扭曲、毁坏、弃置，通通埋葬在土石之下——唯有此地例外，昔日绿地的四周仍旧围绕着一大圈金属。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It might be viewed as a grand memorial of greatness, the sepulcher of Empire, but to the Trantorians - the Hamish people-these were haunted places, filled with ghosts, not to be stirred. Only the Second Foundationers ever set foot in the ancient corridors or touched the titanium gleam.</p><p>此地或可被视为一代伟业的巨大纪念碑、昔日帝国的衣冠冢。但在川陀人（阿姆人）心目中，该处却是不祥之地，充满冤死的亡魂，绝对不能随便惊扰。因此，只有第二基地分子穿梭在古代的回廊中，触摸得到闪闪发光的钛金属。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And even so, all had nearly come to nothing because of the Mule.</p><p>即使如此，由于骡的出现，第二基地的心血差点全部白费。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Mule had actually been on Trantor. What if he had found out the nature of the world he had been standing on? His physical weapons were far greater than those at the disposal of the Second Foundation, his mental weapons almost as great. The Second Foundation would have been hampered always by the necessity of doing nothing but what they must, and by the knowledge that almost any hope of tinning the immediate fight might portend a greater eventual loss.</p><p>骡曾经亲自到过川陀。假使当时他晓得这个世界的真面目，又会有什么结果？骡所拥有的传统武器比第二基地强大无数倍，他的精神力量也和对手旗鼓相当。然而，一来受到金科玉律的限制，二来由于充分了解眼前的胜利可能预示着更大的挫败，第二基地总是感到绑手绑脚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Had it not been for Banta Darell and her swift moment of action- And that, too, had been without the help of the Second Foundation?</p><p>如果不是贝泰·达瑞尔当机立断，后果真是不堪设想。而她那次的行动，也几乎没有第二基地的协助！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then-the Golden ?age, when somehow the First Speakers of the time found ways of becoming active, stopping the Mule in his career of conquest, controlling his mind at last; and then stopping the First Foundation itself when it grew wary and overcurious concerning the nature and identity of the Second Foundation. There was Preem Palver, nineteenth First Speaker and greatest of them all, who had managed to put an end to all danger-not without terrible sacrifice - and who had rescued the Seldon Plan.</p><p>接着便开始了黄金时代。前后几代的第一发言者，终于找到主动出击的方法，遏止了骡的泛银河攻势，进而控制住他的心灵。数十年之后，当第一基地对他们愈来愈好奇、愈来愈疑心的时候，第二基地经过一番努力，也总算成功地使对方收兵。其中，第十九代第一发言者（也是有史以来最伟大的一位）普芮姆·帕佛，完成一项精心设计的计划，一举消除了所有的危机；以重大牺牲为代价，拯救了谢顿计划未来的命运。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, for a hundred and twenty years, the Second Foundation was again as it once had been, hiding in a haunted portion of Trantor. They were hiding no longer from the Imperials, but from the First Foundation still-a First Foundation almost as large as the Galactic Empire had been and even greater in technological expertise.</p><p>过去一百二十年间，第二基地恢复往日的状态，隐匿在川陀某个鬼影幢幢的地方。他们不必再回避帝国，却仍然需要和第一基地躲迷藏。如今的第一基地，几乎已经和昔日的银河帝国一样强大，而科技更是青出于蓝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker's eyes closed in the pleasant warmth and he passed into that never-never state of relaxing hallucinatory experiences that were not quite dreams and not quite conscious thought.</p><p>想到这里，第一发言者慵懒地闭上眼睛，进入一种无我的境界，体会到一种如真似幻的松弛感。这并非全然是梦境，却也不是绝对的清醒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Enough of gloom. All would be well. Trantor was still capital of the Galaxy, for the Second Foundation was here and it was mightier and more in control than ever the Emperor had been.</p><p>雨过天晴，一切都会愈来愈好。川陀依旧是银河的首府，因为第二基地就在这里。比起当年那些皇帝，他们力量更强大，控制得更得心应手。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Foundation would be contained and guided and would move correctly. However formidable their ships and weapons, they could do nothing as long as key leaders could be, at need, mentally controlled.</p><p>第一基地始终只是傀儡，由第二基地负责操纵，使它的举动正确无误。不论他们如何船坚炮利，只要在必要的时候，关键人物都受到精神控制，他们也只有乖乖听命的份。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And the Second Empire would come, but it would not be like the first. It would be a Federated Empire, with its parts possessing considerable self-rule, so that there would be none of the apparent strength and actual weakness of a unitary, centralized government. The new Empire would be looser, more pliant, more flexible, more capable of withstanding strain, and it would be guided always-always-by the hidden men and women of the Second Foundation. Trantor would then be still the capital, more powerful with its forty thousand psychohistorians than ever it had been with its forty-five billion</p><p>有朝一日，第二帝国终将诞生，但不会是第一帝国的翻版。它将是一个联邦制帝国，成员都拥有相当的自治权，因此不会出现一个外强中干的中央集权政府。新帝国的结构将较为松散，较富有弹性和韧性，因而更具应变能力。隐藏在幕后的第二基地男女成员，将永永远远负责指导这个政体。那时，川陀仍会是帝国的首都，但四万名心理史学家的领导能力，强过当年的四百五十亿普通人……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker snapped awake. The sun was lower in the sky. Had he been mumbling? Had he said anything aloud'</p><p>第一发言者猛然惊醒，发现已是日落时分。刚才有没有自言自语？有没有大声说过什么话？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If the Second Foundation had to know much and say little, the ruling Speakers had to know mere and say less, and the First Speaker lead to know mist and say least.</p><p>如果说，第二基地成员要知道得比别人多，说得比别人少，那么身为领导阶层的发言者，就需要知道得更多，但是说得更少，而身为第一发言者，则需要知道得最多，而且说得最少。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He smiled wryly. It was always so tempting to become a Trantorian patriot-to see the whole purpose of the Second Empire as that of bringing about Trantorian hegemony. Seldon had warned of it; he had foreseen even that, five centuries before it could come to pass.</p><p>他露出一抹苦笑。诱惑始终那么强烈，令人忍不住想效忠川陀，忍不住将第二帝国的目标解释为帮川陀取得银河霸主的地位。早在五个世纪之前，谢顿已经预见这一点，并且曾经发出警告。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker had not slept too long, however. It was not yet time for Gendibal's audience.</p><p>然而，第一发言者并未睡着太久，他接见坚迪柏的时间还没到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shandess was looking forward to that private meeting. Gendibal was young enough to look at the Plan with new eyes, and keen enough to see what others might not. And it was not beyond possibility that Shandess would learn from what the youngster had to say.</p><p>桑帝斯对这次的私下会谈寄望颇高。坚迪柏年纪很轻，能用新的眼光审视谢顿计划，而他又有足够敏锐的心灵，足以见前人所未见。从这位最年轻的发言者言谈中，桑帝斯并非没有机会学到些什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No one would ever be certain how much Preem Palver - the great Palver himself-had profited from that day when the young Kol Benjoam, not yet thirty, came to talk to him about possible ways of handling the First Foundation. Benjoam, who was later recognized as the greatest theorist since Seldon, never spoke of that audience in later years, but eventually he became the twenty-first First Speaker. There were some who credited Benjoam, rather than Palver, for the great accomplishments of Palver's administration.</p><p>从来没有人能确定，当年伟大的普芮姆·帕佛接见年轻的寇尔·班裘姆，从那位后辈身上获益多少。当时班裘姆还不到三十岁，专程来向帕佛报告对付第一基地的可行方案。班裘姆后来从未提起那次觐见的经过，但他最后果然成为第二十一代第一发言者，而且被奉为谢顿之后最伟大的理论家。有些人甚至认为，在帕佛时代所完成的丰功伟业，真正的功臣其实是班裘姆，而不是帕佛本人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shandess amused himself with the thought of what Gendibal might say. It was traditional that keen youngsters, confronting the First Speaker alone for the first time, would place their entire thesis in the first sentence. And surely they would not ask for that precious first audience for something trivial-something that might ruin their entire subsequent career by convincing the First Speaker they were lightweights.</p><p>桑帝斯开始跟自己玩一个游戏，猜想坚迪柏将要说些什么。根据第二基地的传统，当一个杰出的年轻后辈，首次有机会与第一发言者单独会晤时，第一句话便要开宗明义。当然，他们绝不会为了芝麻蒜皮的琐事，便浪费掉宝贵的首次觐见机会。否则，第一发言者很可能会认为他们不够份量，这无异是自毁前程。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Four hours later, Gendibal faced him. The young man showed no sign of nervousness. He waited calmly for Shandess to speak first.</p><p>四小时后，坚迪柏终于出现在他面前。这个年轻人没有露出丝毫的紧张，只是默默等待桑帝斯先开口。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shandess said, "You have asked for a private audience, Speaker, on a matter of importance. Could you please summarize the matter for me?"</p><p>于是桑帝斯说：“发言者，你为了一件重要的事，请求私下觐见我。可否请你先扼要说明一下？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Gendibal, speaking quietly, almost as though he were describing what he had just eaten at dinner, said, "First Speaker, the Seldon Plan is meaningless!"</p><p>坚迪柏几乎像是在描述晚餐吃了些什么，以平静的口吻说道：“第一发言者，谢顿计划根本毫无意义！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Stor Gendibal did not require the evidence of others to give him a sense of worth. He could not recall a time when he did not !:now himself to be unusual. He had been recruited for the Second Foundation when he was only a ten-year-old boy by an agent who had recognized the potentialities of his mind.</p><p>史陀·坚迪柏从不需要任何人肯定他的价值，他自小即了解自己与众不同。年仅十岁，第二基地一名特工就发掘到他的心灵潜能，从此他便加入第二基地的行列。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had then done remarkably well at his studies and had taken to psychohistory as a spaceship responds to a gravitational field. Psychohistory had pulled at him and he had curved toward it, reading Seldon's text on the fundamentals when others his age were merely trying to handle differential equations.</p><p>他在学习过程中表现得极为优异。就像重力场吸引太空船一样，心理史学对他具有强大的吸引力，使他身不由己地一头栽进去。同龄弟子还在学习微分方程之际，他已经开始阅读谢顿的心理史学入门教材。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he was fifteen, he entered Trantor's Galactic University (as the University of Trantor had been officially renamed), after an interview during which, when asked what his ambitions were, he had answered firmly, "To be First Speaker before I am forty."</p><p>十五岁那年，他考进了银河大学（即昔日的川陀大学，如今已经正式改名）。接受入学面试时，面试委员问到他将来的志愿，他以坚定的口气答道：“在四十岁前成为第一发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had not bothered to aim for the First Speaker's chair without qualification. To gain it, one way or another, seemed to him to be a certainty. It was to do it in youth that seemed to him to be the goal. Even Preem Palver bad been forty-two on his accession.</p><p>他的目标不仅仅是第一发言者的宝座，对他而言，那几乎是唾手可得的囊中物。言下之意，他的目标是要向时间挑战，因为就连普芮姆·帕佛，也是四十二岁那年才就任的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The interviewer's expression had flickered when Gendibal had said that, but the young man already had the feel of psycholanguage and could interpret that flicker. He knew, as certainly as though the interviewer had announced it, that a small notation would go on his records to the effect that he would be difficult to handle.</p><p>坚迪柏这样回答之后，那名面试委员立刻动容。但是年轻的坚迪柏早已熟悉“心理语言”，懂得诠释那个骤变的神情。他非常清楚（就像那名委员当场宣布一样），自己的档案会加上一条小小的注记，大意是说他是个难缠的家伙。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Well, of course!</p><p>嗯，当然如此！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal intended to be difficult to handle.</p><p>坚迪柏就是打算做个难缠的家伙。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was thirty now. He would be thirty-one in a matter of two months and he was already a member of the Council of Speakers. He had nine years, at most, to become First Speaker and he knew he would make it. This audience with the present First Speaker was crucial to his plans and, laboring to present precisely the proper impression, he had. spared no effort to polish his command of psycholanguage.</p><p>现在他三十岁了，再过两个月，就要庆祝三十一岁生日。想要实现当初的雄心壮志，最多还有九年时间可资利用，但他知道自己一定能够成功。他如今已是发言者评议会的一员，而今天觐见现任的第一发言者，就是他计划中关键性的一步。为了得到最佳的结果，他曾不遗余力地勤练心理语言的沟通技巧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When two Speakers of the Second Foundation communicate with each other, the language is like no other in the Galaxy. It is as much a language of fleeting gestures as of words, as much a matter of detected mental-change patterns as anything else.</p><p>当第二基地两名发言者彼此沟通时，采用的语言是银河中独一无二的。他们除了开口之外，还会配合无数迅疾的手势，以及各种精神型样的变化。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>An outsider would hear little or nothing, but in a short time, much in the way of thought would be exchanged and the communication would be unreportable in its literal form to anyone but still another Speaker.</p><p>如果有外人在场，只能听到极少的语汇，甚至什么也听不见。事实上，在极短暂的时间内，他们已经交换大量的思想讯息。至于沟通的内容，则无法借用文字忠实重述给任何外人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The language of Speakers had its advantage in speed and in infinite delicacy, but it had the disadvantage of making it almost impossible to mask true opinion.</p><p>发言者所使用的语言，优点在于效率极高，而且无比细腻生动。不过它也有缺点，那就是几乎无法掩饰任何心意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal knew his own opinion of the First Speaker. He felt the First Speaker to be a man past his mental prime. The First Speaker -in Gendibal's assessment-expected no crisis, was not trained to meet one, and lacked the sharpness to deal with one if it appeared. With all Shandess's goodwill and amiability, he was the stuff of which disaster was made.</p><p>坚迪柏很了解自己对第一发言者的看法，他觉得第一发言者已经过了精神全盛期。根据坚迪柏的评估，第一发言者没有受过危机处理训练，也从未预见任何危机，万一真有危机出现，他将缺乏当机立断的能力。桑帝斯是个亲切和善的老好人，而这种人正是可怕的祸源。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All of this Gendibal had to hide not merely from words, gestures, and facial expressions, but even from his thoughts. He knew no way of doing so efficiently enough to keep the First Speaker from catching a whiff of it.</p><p>坚迪柏必须将这些想法都隐藏起来，不但在话语、动作、面部表情中不可流露任何迹象，甚至在思想上都要深藏不露。不过，他并不知道有任何有效的方法，能将这些想法掩饰得天衣无缝，不让第一发言者察觉半分蛛丝马迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nor could Gendibal avoid knowing something of the First Speaker's feeling toward him. Through bonhomie and goodwill - quite apparent and reasonably sincere-Gendibal could feel the distant edge of condescension and amusement, and tightened his own mental grip to avoid revealing any resentment in return-or as little as possible.</p><p>同理，坚迪柏也知道第一发言者对自己的感觉。从和蔼可亲的态度中——这相当明显，而且十分诚挚——坚迪柏能感到稍许卖账与玩味的意思。因此他将自己的精神控制收紧了些，以免显露任何憎恶的情绪，至少将它减至最低程度。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker smiled and leaned back in his chair. He did not actually lift his feet to the desk top, but he got across just the right mixture of self-assured ease and informal friendship-just enough of each to leave Gendibal uncertain as to the effect of his statement.</p><p>第一发言者微微一笑，仰身靠向椅背。他并没有把脚翘在书桌上，不过他的身体语言已经十分明确，一来表现出自信满满的安然，二来又显得和对方有些私交，刚好能让坚迪柏摸不着头脑，无法确定自己的话究竟产生了什么作用。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Since Gendibal had not been invited to sit down, the actions and attitudes available to him that might be designed to minimize the uncertainty were limited. It was impossible that the First Speaker did not understand this.</p><p>由于坚迪柏一直没有机会坐下，即使他想做些反应或行动，以便尽量减低这个疑虑，能够采取的方案也少得可怜。这一点，第一发言者绝不可能不了解。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shandess said, "The Seldon Plan is meaningless? What a remarkable statement! Have you looked at the Prime Radiant lately, Speaker Gendibal?"</p><p>桑帝斯终于再度开口：“谢顿计划毫无意义？多么惊人的说法！坚迪柏发言者，你最近观察过元光体吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I study it frequently, First Speaker. It is my duty to do so and my pleasure as well."</p><p>“我经常研究，第一发言者。这是我的职责，也是我的兴趣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you, by any chance, study only those portions of it that fall under your purview, now and then? Do you observe it in microfashion-an equation system here, an adjustment rivulet there? Highly important, of course, but I have always thought it an excellent occasional exercise to observe the whole course. Studying the Prime Radiant, acre by acre, has its uses-but observing it as a continent is inspirational. To tell you the truth, Speaker, I have not done it for a long time myself. Would you join me?"</p><p>“通常，你会不会只专注于自己负责的部分？你是否一律用微观方式观察，仔细审视某些方程组和微调路径？这样做当然极为重要，不过我一向认为，偶尔做一次整体观察，会是一个绝佳的练习。一寸寸地研究元光体自有其必要，但对它做一次鸟瞰，则是极具启发性的。告诉你一句老实话，发言者，我自己也有好久没这么做了。你愿意陪我温故知新吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal dared not pause too long. It had to be done, and it must be done easily and pleasantly or it might as well not be done. "It would be an honor and a pleasure, First Speaker."</p><p>坚迪柏不敢沉默太久。他一定得遵命，并且必须表现得欣然而从容，否则还不如根本别答应。“第一发言者，这是我的荣幸，也是一件乐事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker depressed a lever on the side of his desk. T here was one such in the office of every Speaker and the one in Gendibal's office was in no way inferior to that of the First Speaker. The Second Foundation was an equalitarian society in all its surface manifestations-the unimportant ones. In fact, the only official prerogative of the First Speaker was that which was explicit in his title he always spoke first.</p><p>第一发言者按下书桌旁的一个握柄。每位发言者的办公室都配备有这种装置，而相较于第一发言者的元光体，坚迪柏的那个在各方面都毫不逊色。表面上看来，第二基地是个人人平等的社会，只不过表面上的一切并不重要。事实上，第一发言者的正式特权只有一项而已，他的头衔已经说得很清楚，他总是最先发言的一位。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The room grew dark with the depression of the lever but, almost at once, the darkness lifted into a pearly dimness. Both long walls turned faintly creamy, then brighter and whiter, and finally there appeared neatly printed equations-so small that they could not be easily read.</p><p>闸柄按下之后，整个房间随即陷入一片黑暗，但几乎在同一瞬间，黑暗便转换成一种珍珠般的幽光。两侧的巨幅墙壁变成淡淡的乳黄色，接着愈来愈亮，愈来愈白，终于显出无数列印整齐的方程式，每一行都又细又小，几乎无法看得清楚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you have no objections," said the First Speaker, making it quite clear that there would be none allowed, "we will reduce the magnification in order to see as much at one time as we can."</p><p>“如果你不反对的话，”第一发言者的意思相当明显，根本不给对方反对的余地，“我们将放大率尽量缩小，以便一眼就能看到最多的内容。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The neat printing shrank down into fine hairlines, faint black meanderings over the pearly background.</p><p>一行行整齐的方程式迅速缩小，直到每行都细如发丝，在珍珠色的背景上，形成无数模糊的黑色曲线。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker touched the keys of the small console built into the arm of his chair. "We'll bring it back to the start-to the lifetime of Hari Seldon - and we'll adjust it to a small forward movement. We'll shutter it so that we can only see a decade of development at a time. It gives one a wonderful feeling of the flow of history, with no distractions by the details. I wonder if you have ever done this."</p><p>第一发言者的右手挪到座椅扶手上，按下小型控制板的某些按键。“让我们回到起点，回到哈里·谢顿的时代，然后调整成缓缓向前推进的模式。我们控制好视窗的大小，每次只看十年的发展，这样能有一种静观历史推移的奇妙感觉，不会因为细微末节而分神。不晓得你以前有没有试过？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Never exactly this way, First Speaker."</p><p>“从未真正这样做过，第一发言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You should. It's a marvelous feeling. Observe the sparseness of the black tracery at the start. There was not much chance for alternatives in the first few decades. The branch points, however, increase exponentially with time. Were it not for the fact that, as soon as a particular branch is taken, there is an extinction of a vast array of others in its future, all would soon become unmanageable. Of course, in dealing with the future, we must be careful what extinctions we rely upon."</p><p>“你该试试，这是一种绝妙的感受。注意看，起点处的黑色纹路十分稀疏，因为在最初几十年间，没有什么机会出现其他可能。然而，分枝点会以指数式的速度增加。每当选定一个特殊的分枝，其他分枝的发展就会大量减少，否则整个画面很快会变得无法处理。当然，在研究未来的发展时，我们必须谨慎选择应当取消哪些分枝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know, First Speaker." There was a touch of dryness in Gendibal's response that he could not quire remove.</p><p>“我知道，第一发言者。”坚迪柏的回答带着一丝冷淡，他实在无法百分之百掩饰。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker did not respond to it. "Notice the winding lines of symbols in red. There is a pattern to them. To all appearances, they should exist randomly, as even- Speaker earns his place by adding refinements to Seldon's original Plan. It would seem there is no way, after all, of predicting where a refinement can be added easily or where a particular Speaker will find his interests or his ability tending, and yet I have long suspected that the admixture of Seldon Black and Speaker Red follows a strict law that is strongly dependent on time and on very little else."</p><p>对此，第一发言者并没有任何反应。“注意那些红色符号形成的曲线，它们的图样具有某种规律。照理说，它们显然应该随机出现；每位发言者在获得发言权之前，都必须对原始的谢顿计划做一点补充，这些红线就是补充的内容。想要预测哪里比较容易补充，或是发言者由于个人的兴趣和能力，倾向于选择哪一部分，似乎都是不可能的事。然而，长久以来我一直怀疑，‘谢顿黑线’和‘发言者红线’的混合体，图样变化遵循着某种严格规律。这种规律和时间有很重大的关联，和其他因素则几乎无关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal watched as the years passed and as the black and red hairlines made an almost hypnotic interlacing pattern. The pattern meant nothing in itself, of course. What counted were the symbols of which it was composed.</p><p>坚迪柏仔细盯着墙上的画面，随着“时间”一年一年流逝，黑线与红线交织成愈来愈复杂的图样，看久了几乎令人昏昏欲睡。当然，图样本身一点意义也没有，真正有意义的，是其中的无数符号。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Here and there a bright-blue rivulet made its appearance, bellying out; branching, and becoming prominent, then falling in upon itself and fading into the black or red.</p><p>不久，各处出现一些明亮的蓝线，逐渐向外扩张，生出许多分枝，变得愈来愈显眼，最后又汇聚在一起，尽数没入黑线或红线之中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "Deviation Blue," and the feeling of distaste, originating in each, filled the space between them. "We catch it over and over, and we'll be coming to the Century of Deviations eventually."</p><p>第一发言者说：“这是‘偏逸蓝线’。”两人心中不约而同生出嫌恶的情绪，充塞在周遭的空间。“我们注意跟踪它，最后就会来到‘偏逸世纪’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They did. One could tell precisely when the shattering phoneme- non of the Mule momentarily filled the Galaxy, as the Prime Radiant suddenly grew thick with branching rivulets of blue-more starting than could be closed down-until the room itself seemed to turn blue as the lines thickened and marked the wall with brighter and brighter pollution. (It was the only word.)</p><p>他们果然看到了，甚至能精确指出骡乱何时骤然震撼银河。在那个时间点，元光体射出的蓝色线条突然加速繁衍，几乎暴涨到无法收拾的地步。随着蓝线继续不断开枝散叶，蓝色光芒愈来愈强，整个房间似乎都变成蓝色，整幅墙壁也都遭到蓝线的污染（也只有“污染”一词能够形容）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It reached its peak and then faded, thinned, and came together for a long century before it trickled to its end at last. When it was gone, and when the Plan had returned to black and red, it was clear that Preem Palver's hand had been there.</p><p>蓝线终于达到猖獗的极限，随即开始消退，愈来愈稀疏，并逐渐聚在一起。又过了一个世纪，才终于消失殆尽。蓝线消失之处，显然就是普芮姆·帕佛的心血结晶所在，从此，谢顿计划又恢复了黑线与红线的构图。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Onward, onward</p><p>继续前进，继续前进……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's the present," said the First Speaker comfortably.</p><p>“这里就是现在的情况。”第一发言者以轻松的口气说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Onward, onward</p><p>继续向前，继续向前……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then a narrowing into a veritable knot of close-knit black with little red in it.</p><p>然后所有的线条汇集一处，像是一个紧密的黑色绳结，其间装饰着少许红线。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's the establishment of the Second Empire," said the First Speaker.</p><p>“那代表第二帝国的建立。”第一发言者解释道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He shut off the Prime Radiant and the room was bathed in ordinary light.</p><p>这时，他关掉了元光体，整个房间再度沐浴在普通灯光下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said, "That was an emotional experience."</p><p>坚迪柏说：“实在是个动人的经验。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," smiled the First Speaker, "and you are careful not to identify the emotion, as far as you can manage to fail to identify it. It doesn't matter. Let me make the points I wish to make.</p><p>“没错。”第一发言者微微一笑，“而你一直很小心，尽可能不让情绪展现出来。但这并不重要，让我跟你把话说明白吧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You will notice, first, the all-but-complete absence of Deviation Blue after the time of Preem Palver - over the last twelve decades, in other words. You will notice that there are no reasonable probabilities of Deviations above the fifth-class over the next five centuries. You will notice, too, that we have begun extending the refinements of psychohistory beyond the establishment of the Second Empire. As you undoubtedly know, Hari Seldon - although a transcendent genius-is not, and could not, be all-knowing. We have improved on him. We know more about psychohistory than he could possibly have known.</p><p>“首先你应该注意到，在普芮姆·帕佛的时代之后，偏逸蓝线就几乎完全消失。换句话说，蓝线已经有一百二十年未曾出现。你也应该注意到，未来五个世纪内，再度出现高于五级的‘偏逸现象’几率实在太小。此外你还应该注意到，我们已经开始拓展谢顿计划，也就是进行第二帝国建立之后的心理史学计算。你一定明白，虽然哈里·谢顿是个超越时代的天才，却不可能无所不知无所不晓。我们不断改良他的成就，如今，我们对于心理史学的认识，是谢顿当年绝对无法达到的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Seldon ended his calculations with the Second Empire and we have continued beyond it. Indeed, if I may say so without offense, the new Hyper-Plan that goes past the establishment of the Second Empire is very largely my doing and has earned me my present post.</p><p>“谢顿的计算终止于第二帝国的诞生，我们则继续推算下去。其实，我可以大言不惭地说，这个涵盖第二帝国往后发展的‘超谢顿计划’，绝大部分内容出自我的手笔，这也是我今天坐在这个位子上的主因。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I tell you all this so that you can spare me unnecessary talk. With all this, how do you manage to conclude that the Seldon Plan is meaningless? It is without flaw. The mere fact that it survived the Century of Deviations-with all due respect to Palver's genius-is the best evidence we have that it is without flaw. Where is its weakness, young man, that you should brand the Plan as meaningless?"</p><p>“我告诉你这么多，是要你别跟我说没有必要的废话。我们拥有这么完善的计算，你怎么能说谢顿计划毫无意义？它根本就是完美无瑕的。谢顿计划能够安然渡过偏逸世纪，便是它毫无瑕疵的最佳证明，当然，帕佛的天才也功不可没。年轻人，谢顿计划究竟有什么缺陷，你竟敢把它贴上毫无意义的标签？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal stood stiffly upright. "You are right, First Speaker. The Seldon Plan has no flaw."</p><p>坚迪柏僵直地站在那里。“您说得很对，第一发言者，谢顿计划的确毫无瑕疵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You withdraw your remark, then?"</p><p>“那么，你愿收回自己的成见？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, First Speaker. Its lack of flaw is its flaw. Its flawlessness is fatal!"</p><p>“不，第一发言者。毫无瑕疵正是它的瑕疵，完美无瑕乃是它的致命伤！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker regarded Gendibal with equanimity. He had learned to control his expressions and it amused him to watch Gendibal's ineptness in this respect. At every exchange, the young man did his best to hide his feelings, but each time, he exposed them completely.</p><p>第一发言者仍然平静地望着坚迪柏。他对自己的表情早已练到收放自如，看到坚迪柏这方面的笨拙表现，他感到十分有趣。每一次的讯息交换，这个年轻人都尽量掩饰住自己的情感，但每次却毫无例外地暴露无遗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shandess studied him dispassionately. He was a thin young man, not much above the middle height, with thin lips and bony, restless hands. He had dark, humorless eyes that tended to smolder.</p><p>桑帝斯以不带感情的目光打量着他。坚迪柏是个瘦削的年轻人，仅仅比一般人略高一点，他的嘴唇很薄，一双瘦骨嶙峋的手总是闲不下来。他的一双黑眼睛显得冰冷无情，还微微透着忧郁的目光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He would be, the First Speaker knew, a hard person to talk out of his convictions.</p><p>第一发言者心知肚明，他是一个难以说服的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You speak in paradoxes, Speaker," he said.</p><p>“你讲的是一种诡论，发言者。”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It sounds like a paradox, First Speaker, because there is so much about Seldon's Plan that we take for granted and accept in so unquestioning a manner."</p><p>“只是听起来像个诡论，第一发言者。因为我们一向将谢顿计划的种种都视为理所当然，大家照单全收，从来未曾置疑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what is it you question, then?"</p><p>“那么，你的疑问又在哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Plan's very basis. We all know that the Plan will not work if its nature-or even its existence-is known to too many of those whose behavior it is designed to predict."</p><p>“在于该计划的最根本。我们都知道，如果该计划所试图预测的对象，其中有太多人知晓计划的本质，甚至只是知晓它的存在，这个计划就不可能成功。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I believe Hari Seldon understood that. I even believe he made it one of his two fundamental axioms of psychohistory."</p><p>“我相信哈里·谢顿了解这一点。我甚至相信，他将这个事实定为心理史学两大基本公设之一。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He did not anticipate the Mule, First Speaker, and therefore he could not anticipate the extent to which the Second Foundation would become an obsession with the people of the First Foundation, once they had been shown its importance by the Mule."</p><p>“可是他并未预见骡，第一发言者。因此他也无法预见，当骡证明了第二基地的重要性之后，我们竟然会成为第一基地成员的眼中钉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari Seldon……" and for one moment, the First Speaker shuddered and fell silent.</p><p>“哈里·谢顿……”第一发言者忽然打了一个冷战，闭上了嘴巴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon's physical appearance was known to all the members of the Second Foundation. Reproductions of him in two and in three dimensions, photographic and holographic, in bas-relief and in the round, sitting and standing, were ubiquitous. They all represented him in the last few years of his life. All were of an old and benign man, face wrinkled with the wisdom of the aged, symbolizing the quintessence of well-ripened genius.</p><p>哈里·谢顿的容貌，第二基地所有的成员都很熟悉。在第二基地大本营中，处处可见谢顿的肖像，不论是二维或三维、照片或全息、浅浮雕或圆雕，坐姿或站姿。这些肖像一律取材自晚年的谢顿，一律是一位慈祥的老者，脸上布满代表成熟智慧的皱纹，以表现出这位天才最圆熟的神韵。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the First Speaker now recalled seeing a photograph reputed to be Seldon as a young man. The photograph was neglected, since the thought of a young Seldon was almost a contradiction in terms. Yet Shandess had seen it, and the thought had suddenly come to him that Stor Gendibal looked remarkably like the young Seldon.</p><p>第一发言者现在却想起来，他曾经看过一张据说是谢顿年轻时的相片。那张相片从未受到重视，因为“年轻的谢顿”几乎就像是个矛盾的名词。但桑帝斯的确看过那张相片，如今他心中突然冒出的念头，是史陀·坚迪柏和年轻的谢顿极为相像。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Ridiculous? It was the sort of superstition that afflicted everyone, now and then, however rational they might be. He was deceived by a fugitive similarity. If he had the photograph before him, he would see at once that the similarity was an illusion. Yet why should that silly thought have occurred to him now?</p><p>荒唐！根本就是迷信。不论何时何地，不论多么理智的人，有时也难免会被这种迷信纠缠。自己只是被一种飘忽的神似所欺骗，如果现在那张相片就在眼前，他立刻能发现这只是一种幻象。然而，此时此刻为什么会冒出这个傻念头呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He recovered. It had been a momentary quaver-a transient derailment of thought-too brief to be noticed by anyone but a Speaker. Gendibal might interpret it as he pleased.</p><p>他很快回过神来。那只是极短暂的悸动，只是思绪的瞬间脱轨，除了发言者，其他人不可能察觉得到。不过，不晓得坚迪柏会如何诠释。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari Seldon," he said very firmly the second time, "knew well that there were an infinite number of possibilities he could not foresee, and it was for that reason that he set up the Second Foundation. We did not foresee the Mule either, but tie recognized him once he was upon us and we stopped him. We did not foresee the subsequent obsession of the First Foundation with ourselves, but we saw it when it came and we stopped it. What is it about this that you can possibly find fault with?"</p><p>“哈里·谢顿，”这次他的语气非常坚定，“明白未来有无数种可能，都是他所无法预见的，由于这个缘故，他才设立第二基地。我们自己也没有预测到骡，但是当他威胁到我们的时候，我们立刻觉察到他的危险，及时阻止了他。我们也未曾料到，自己后来竟会成为第一基地的眼中钉，但是危机浮现之际，我们便及时发现，终究阻止了这个发展。在这些历史事件中，你能找到任何错误吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For one thing," said Gendibal, "the obsession of the First Foundation with us is not yet over."</p><p>“第一点，”坚迪柏说，“第一基地对我们的戒心，至今仍未解除。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was a distinct ebb in the deference with which Gendibal had been speaking. He had noted the quaver in the First Speaker's voice (Shandess decided) and had interpreted it as uncertainty. That had to be countered.</p><p>坚迪柏语气中的敬意明显地减少。（根据桑帝斯的判断）他已经注意到对方声音中那一下悸动，并且将它诠释为一种迟疑。这一定要想办法纠正，桑帝斯这么想。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said briskly, "Let me anticipate. There would be people on the First Foundation, who-comparing the hectic difficulties of the first nearly four centuries of existence with the placidity of the last twelve decades-will come to the conclusion that this cannot be unless the Second Foundation is taking good care of the Plan-and, of course, they will be right in so concluding. They will decide that the Second Foundation may not have been destroyed after all-and, of course, they will be right in so deciding. In fact, we've received reports that there is a young man on the First Foundation's capital world of Terminus, an official of their government, who is quite convinced of all this. -1 forget his name……"</p><p>第一发言者流畅地说：“让我来推测一下。第一基地的某些人，将最初四个世纪的艰困历史，与过去一百二十年的太平岁月作比较，得出一项结论：除非第二基地仍旧好好守护着谢顿计划，否则不可能有这种结果，当然，他们这个结论完全正确。而且，他们会进而推断，第二基地根本没有被摧毁，当然，他们这样推断也完全正确。事实上，根据我们收到的一些报告，第一基地的首都世界端点星上，有一个年轻人，一名政府官员，他就十分相信这个说法。我忘了他的名字……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Golan Trevize," said Gendibal softly. "It was I who first noted the matter in the reports, and it was I who directed the matter to your office."</p><p>“葛兰·崔维兹。”坚迪柏轻声说，“是我首先从报告中发现这件事，也是我将这个报告转到您的办公室。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh?" said the First Speaker with exaggerated politeness. "And how did your attention come to be focused on him?"</p><p>“哦？”第一发言者用夸张的礼貌口气应道，“你是怎么注意到他的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"One of our agents on Terminus sent in a tedious report on the newly elected members of their Council-a perfectly routine matter usually sent to and ignored by all Speakers. This one caught my eye because of the nature of the description of one new Councilman, Golan Trevize. From the description, he seemed unusually self-assured and combative."</p><p>“我们派驻在端点星的某位特工，不久前送回一份冗长的报告，内容是基地新科议员的背景资料。这纯粹是一件例行报告，发言者通常都不会留意。不过这份报告却吸引了我，因为上面有那位新当选的议员葛兰·崔维兹的详细描述。我从那些记述中看出来，他似乎过分自信，而且斗志昂扬。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You recognized a kindred spirit, did you?"</p><p>“你发现有人和你臭味相投，是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not at all," said Gendibal, stiffly. "He seemed a reckless person who enjoyed doing ridiculous things, a description which does not apply to me. In any case, I directed an in-depth study. It did not take long for me to decide that he would have made good material for us if he had been recruited at an early age."</p><p>“完全不是那么回事。”坚迪柏僵硬地答道，“他似乎是个莽撞的人，喜欢做些荒唐的事，这点和我很不一样。总之，我主导了一次深入调查。我很快就发现，他如果年轻时被我们吸收，会是第二基地的一位优秀成员。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps," said the First Speaker, "but you know that we do not recruit on Terminus."</p><p>“也许吧，”第一发言者说，“但是你也晓得，我们从不吸收端点星的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know that well. In any case, even without our training, he has an unusual intuition. It is, of course, thoroughly undisciplined. I was, therefore. not particularly surprised that he ??ad grasped the fact that the Second Foundation still exists. I felt it important enough, however, to direct a memo on the matter to your office."</p><p>“这点我很明白。总之，虽然没有接受过我们的训练，他却拥有不凡的直觉。当然，那种直觉完全未经剪裁。因此，虽说他猜到第二基地仍然存在，我也并不感到特别惊讶。然而，我觉得这点已经足够重要，所以送了一份备忘录到您的办公室。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And I take it from your manner that there is a new development?"</p><p>“从你的态度看来，我猜一定又有什么新发展。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Having grasped the fact that we still exist, thanks to his highly developed intuitive abilities, he then used it in a characteristically undisciplined fashion and has, as a result, been exiled from Terminus."</p><p>“由于具有很强的直觉，他猜中了我们仍旧存在的事实，然后便肆无忌惮地拿来大做文章，结果被逐出了端点星。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker lifted his eyebrows. "You stop suddenly. You want me to interpret the significance. Without using my computer, let me mentally apply a rough approximation of Seldon's equations and guess that a shrewd Mayor, capable of suspecting that the Second Foundation exists, prefers not to have an undisciplined individual shout it to the Galaxy and thus alert said Second Foundation to the danger. I take it Branno the Bronze decided that Terminus is safer with Trevize off the planet."</p><p>第一发言者扬起双眉。“你突然停下来，是想要我来诠释其中的意义。我暂且不动用电脑，以心算大致推估一下谢顿方程式。我猜那个机灵的市长，也有足够的智慧怀疑我们的存在，因此不希望那个不守纪律的家伙惊动整个银河，令她心目中那个第二基地提高警觉。我猜，根据铜人布拉诺的判断，将崔维兹逐出端点星，才能确保自身的安全。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She might have imprisoned Trevize or had him quietly assassinated."</p><p>“她大可将崔维兹囚禁，或悄悄将他处决。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The equations are not reliable when applied to individuals, as you well know. They deal only with humanity in mass. Individual behavior is therefore unpredictable and it is possible to assume that the Mayor is a humane individual who feels imprisonment, let alone assassination, is unmerciful."</p><p>“想必你很清楚，将谢顿方程式用到个人身上，得到的结果根本不可靠，那些方程式只适用于人类群体。由于个人行为无法预测，我们可以假设市长是个人道主义者，认为囚禁是一种残酷的做法，更遑论处决。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal said nothing for a while. It was an eloquent nothing, and he maintained it just long enough for the First Speaker to grow uncertain of himself but not so long as to induce a defensive anger.</p><p>坚迪柏好一阵子没有再讲话，但是这段沉默抵得上滔滔雄辩。他将沉默的时间拿捏得恰到好处，足以令第一发言者动摇自信，又不至于引起对方的反感。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He timed it to the second and then he said, "That is not my interpretation. I believe that Trevize, at this moment, represents the cutting edge of the greatest threat to the Second Foundation in its history-a greater danger even than the Mule!"</p><p>他在心中倒数读秒，时间一到，他立刻说：“这并不是我心目中的诠释。我相信，那个崔维兹此时扮演的是个前锋，而他背后的力量，会对第二基地构成史无前例的威胁——甚至比骡还要危险！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>4</p><p>4</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal was satisfied. The force of the statement had worked well. The First Speaker had not expected it and was caught off-balance. From this moment, the whip hard was Gendibal's. If he had any doubt of that at all, it vanished with Shandess's next remark.</p><p>坚迪柏感到很满意，这番话的确发挥了预期的威力。第一发言者并未料到这种惊人之语，一听之下方寸大乱。从此刻开始，坚迪柏抢到了主动权。即使他对这个逆转还有丝毫存疑，一旦桑帝斯再度开口，存疑也立时消失无踪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does this have anything to do with your contention that Seldon's Plan is meaningless?"</p><p>“这和你认为谢顿计划毫无意义的主张，又有什么关系？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal gambled on complete certainty, driving in with a didacticism that would not allow the First Speaker to recover. He said, "First Speaker, it is an article of faith that it was Preem Palver who restored the Plan to its course after the wild aberrance of the Century of Deviations. Study the Prime Radiant and you will see that the Deviations did not disappear till two decades after Palver's death and that not one Deviation has appeared since. The credit might rest with the First Speakers since Palver, but that is improb-</p><p>坚迪柏自认稳操胜算，他不让第一发言者有喘息的机会，随即以训人的口气说：“第一发言者，一般人都深信，谢顿计划经过偏逸世纪的重大扭曲后，是普芮姆·帕佛又令它回到正轨。但只要仔细研究元光体，您就会发现，直到帕佛死后二十年，偏逸蓝线才完全消失，从此再也没有任何蓝线出现。这一点，虽然可归功于帕佛之后的诸位第一发言者，事实上却不大可能。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Improbable? Granted none of us have been Palvers, but-why</p><p>“不大可能？纵使我们几位都比不上帕佛，可是——为何不大可能？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Will you allow me to demonstrate, First Speaker? Using the mathematics of psychohistory, I can clearly show that the chances of total disappearance of Deviation are too microscopically small to have taken place through anything the Second Foundation can do. You need not allow me if you lack the time or the desire for the demonstration, which will take half an hour of close attention. I can, as an alternative, call for a full meeting of the Speaker's Table and demonstrate it there. But that would mean a loss of time for me and unnecessary controversy."</p><p>“第一发言者，能否准许我示范一下？利用心理史学的数学，我能清楚地证明，偏逸现象完全消失的几率太小太小了，无论第二基地如何努力，也几乎无法实现。我的示范得花半个小时，而您必须聚精会神，如果您没有时间，或者没有兴趣，大可不必答应我的要求。我还有另一个机会，就是请求召开发言者圆桌会议，向所有的发言者公开示范。但是这样会浪费我的时间，还会引起不必要的争辩。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, and a possible loss of face for me. -Demonstrate the matter to me now. But a word of warning." The First Speaker was making a heroic effort to recover. "If what you show me is worthless, I will not forget that."</p><p>“对，而且可能会让我丢脸。现在就示范给我看吧，不过我要先警告你，”第一发言者力图挽回颓势，“假如你给我看的东西毫无价值，我一辈子不会忘记。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If it proves worthless," said Gendibal with an effortless pride that overrode the other, "you will have my resignation on the spot."</p><p>“果真毫无价值的话，”坚迪柏以骄傲的口气，轻松地化解对方的攻势，“我会当场向您辞职。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It took, actually, considerably more than half an hour, for the First Speaker questioned the mathematics with near-savage intensity.</p><p>示范过程比预定时间超出许多，因为从头到尾，第一发言者都在紧紧逼问数学内容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal made up some of the time by his smooth use of his MicroRadiant. The device-which could locate any portion of the vast Plan holographically and with required n either wall nor desk sized console-had come into use only a decade ago and the First Speaker had never learned the knack of handling it. Gendibal was aware of that. The First Speaker knew that he was.</p><p>坚迪柏使用“微光体”极为熟练，因此其实还节省了一点时间。微光体能将谢顿计划任何部分以全息画面显示，无需以墙壁当屏幕，也不必书桌那么大的控制台。这种装置在十年前才正式启用，第一发言者从未学会操作的诀窍。坚迪柏明白这一点，第一发言者也知道瞒不过他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal hooked it over his rigth thumb and manipulated it with his four fingers, using his hand deliberately as though it were a musical instrument. (Indeed, he had written a small paper on the analogies. )</p><p>坚迪柏将微光体挂在右手拇指上，用其他四根指头操作控制键钮。他的手指从容地挪移，仿佛是在演奏某种乐器。他还真写过一篇短文，讨论两者的类似之处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The equations Gendibal produced (and found with sure ease) moved back and forth snakily to accompany his commentary. He could obtain definitions, if necessary; set up axioms; and produce graphics, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional (to say nothing of projections of multidimensional relationships).</p><p>坚迪柏用微光体产生的（并轻易找到的）方程式，随着他的解说，不断蜿蜿蜒蜒地前后运动。必要的时候，他可以随时叫出定义，列出公设，画出二维与三维图表（当然也能将“多维关系式”投影到这些图表上）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gendibal's commentary was clear and incisive and the First Speaker abandoned the game. He was won over and said, "I do not recall having seen annnnalysis of this nature. Whose work is it?"</p><p>坚迪柏的解说清晰而精辟，终于使得第一发言者甘拜下风。他心悦诚服地问道：“我不记得看过这样的分析，这是什么人的成果？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"First Speaker, it is my own. I have published the basic mathematics involved."</p><p>“第一发言者，这是我自己的成果。我已经发表过有关这方面的数学了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Very clever, Speaker Gendibal. Something like this will put you in line for the First Speakership, should I die-or retire."</p><p>“非常杰出，坚迪柏发言者。你有这样的成就，一旦我死了，或者退位的话，下一代第一发言者很可能就是你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have given that matter no thought, First Speaker-but since there's no chance of your believing that, I withdraw the comment. I have given it thought and I hope I will be First Speaker, since whoever succeeds to the post must follow a procedure that only I see clearly."</p><p>“我从未想过这一点，第一发言者——可是既然您绝无可能相信，我索性收回这个说法。事实上，我的确想过这件事，并且希望自己能够成为第一发言者。因为不论是谁继任这个职位，都得遵行一个唯有我才看得清楚的方案。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said the First Speaker, "inappropriate modesty can be very dangerous. What procedure? Perhaps the present First Speaker may follow it, too. If I am too old to have made the creative leap you have, I am not so old that I cannot follow your direction."</p><p>“很好，”第一发言者说，“不当的谦虚其实非常危险。究竟是什么样的方案？或许现任的第一发言者也能遵行。即使我已经老得无法作出像你那样的突破，我至少还有能力接受你的指导。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a graceful surrender and Gendibal's heart warned, rather unexpectedly, toward the older man, even as he realized that this was precisely the First Speaker's intention.</p><p>这实在是相当大方的让步，坚迪柏完全没有料到，顿时心中充满温暖，虽然他明知这正在老前辈的意料中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you, First Speaker, for I will need your help badly. I cannot expect to sway the Table without your enlightened leadership." (Grace for grace.) "I assume, then, that you have already seen from what I have demonstrated that it is impossible for the Century of Deviations to have been corrected under our policies or for all Deviations to have ceased since then."</p><p>“谢谢您，第一发言者，因为我太需要您助我一臂之力。没有您的英明领导，我自己不可能支配圆桌会议。”这就叫礼尚往来，“所以说，我想，您已经从我刚才的示范中看出来，我们采取的对策不可能矫正偏逸世纪，也无法使所有的偏逸现象从此消失。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This is clear to me," said the First Speaker. "If your mathematics is correct, then in order for the Plannto have recovered as it did and to work as perfectly as it seems to be working, it would be necessary for us to be able to predict the reactions of small groups of people - even of individuals-with some degree of assurance."</p><p>“这点我很清楚。”第一发言者说，“假定你的数学推导正确无误，那么，为了让谢顿计划真的完全回到正轨，而且继续完美无缺地发展下去，我们必须能够相当准确地预测少数人的反应，甚至是个人的反应。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quite so. Since the mathematics of psychohistory does not allow this, the Deviations should not have vanished and, even more so, should not have remained absent. You see, then, what I meant when I said earlier that the flaw in the Seldon Plannwas its flawlessness."</p><p>“非常正确。既然心理史学的数学做不到这一点，偏逸现象就不可能消失，更不可能永远不再出现。现在您应该明白，我刚才为什么会说：谢顿计划的瑕疵就在于完美无瑕。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The First Speaker said, "Either the Seldon Planndoes possess Deviations, then, or there is something wrong in your mathematics. Since I must admit that the Seldon Plan has not shown Deviations in a century and more, it follows that there is something wrong with your mathematics-except that I detected no fallacies or missteps."</p><p>第一发言者说：“现在只有两种可能，一是谢顿计划中确实还有偏逸现象，二是你的数学推导犯了错误。由于我必须承认，一个多世纪以来，谢顿计划并未显现任何偏逸，因此你的推导一定出了问题。可是，我又找不出任何谬误或无心之失。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You do wrong," said Gendibal, "to exclude a third alternative. It is quite possible for the Seldon Plan to possess no Deviations and yet for there to be nothing wrong in my mathematics when it predicts that to be impossible."</p><p>“您犯了一个错误，”坚迪柏说，“您排除了第三种可能性。上述两者确有可能同时成立，谢顿计划不再有任何偏逸，而我的数学推导也完全正确，虽然后者否定了前者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I fail to see the third alternative."</p><p>“我看不出有第三种可能。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Suppose the Seldon Plan is being controlled by means of a psychohistorical method so advanced that the reactions of small groups of people-even perhaps of individual persons-can be predicted, a method that we of the Second Foundation do not possess. Then, and only then, my mathematics would predict that the Seldon Plan should indeed experience no Deviations?"</p><p>“假如谢顿计划被某种先进的心理史学方法所控制，这个方法超越了我们现有的成就，可以预测一小群人的反应，甚至个人的反应也许都能预测。当且仅当在此前提下，根据我的数学推导，谢顿计划会摆脱任何偏逸现象！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a while (by Second Foundation standards) the First Speaker made no response. He said, "There is no such advanced psychohistorical method that is known to me or, I am certain from your manner, to you. If you and I know of none, the chance that any other Speaker, or any group of Speakers, has developed such a micropsychohistory-if I may call it that-and has kept it secret from the rest of the Table is infinitesimally small. Don't you agree?"</p><p>第一发言者沉默不语，过了好一阵子（以第二基地的标准而言），他才说：“那种先进的心理史学方法，我从未听说过，而听你的口气，我确定你也没有概念。如果连你我都不知情，那么，某位或某些发言者发展出这种‘微观心理史学’——让我暂且这样称呼——而能对圆桌会议其他成员保密，这种机会是无限小。你同意吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I agree."</p><p>“我同意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then either your analysis is wrong or else micropsychohistory is in the hands of some group outside the Second Foundation."</p><p>“那么又只剩下两种可能，一是你的分析有误，二是微观心理史学的确存在，却并非掌握在第二基地手中。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly, First Speaker, the latter alternative must be correct."</p><p>“完全正确，第一发言者，第二种可能一定就是事实。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Can you demonstrate the truth of such a statement?"</p><p>“你能证明这个立论的真实性吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I cannot, in any formal way; but consider- Has there not already been a person who could affect the Seldon Plan by dealing with individual people?"</p><p>“我无法以正式的方法证明，但是请您回想一下：不是早已出现过一个人，可以通过操纵个人，而影响整个谢顿计划吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I presume you are referring to the Mule."</p><p>“我猜你指的是骡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, certainly."</p><p>“没错，正是他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Mule could only disrupt. The problem here is that the Seldon Plan is working too well, considerably closer to perfection than your mathematics would allow. You would need an Anti-Mule-someone who is as capable of overriding the Plan as the Mule was, but who acts for the opposite motive-overriding not to disrupt but to perfect."</p><p>“骡专事破坏，如今的问题则是谢顿计划进行得太顺利，太过接近完美，而你的推导证明这是不可能的。你现在要找的是一个‘反骡’——他能像骡一样改写谢顿计划，可是动机完全相反，并不是要破坏，而是要精益求精。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly, First Speaker. I wish I had thought of that expression. What was the Mule? A mutant. But where did he come from? How did he come to be? No one really knows. Might there not be more?"</p><p>“正是如此，第一发言者，只恨我自己无法表达得这样精辟。骡是何方神圣？是个突变异种。但他是从哪里冒出来的？为什么具有那种异能？谁也不知道真正的答案。难道不可能有更多类似的人吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Apparently not. The one thing that is best known about the Mule is that he was sterile. Hence his name. Or do you think that is a myth?"</p><p>“显然不会有。骡最着名的一点就是他无法生育，他的名字便是由此而来。莫非你认为那只是个传说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am not referring to descendants of the Mule. Might it not be that the Mule was an aberrant member of what is-or has now become-a sizable group of people with Mulish powers who-for some reason of their own-are not disrupting the Seldon Plan but supporting it?"</p><p>“我并不是指骡的后人。我的意思是，可能有一大群人——或是现在变成了一大群——全都具有和骡相近的能力，而骡只是那个团体的叛徒。那群人为了自己的理由，非但不想破坏谢顿计划，反而在尽力维护它。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why in the Galaxy should they support it?"</p><p>“银河在上，他们为何要维护谢顿计划？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why do we support it? We plan a Second Empire in which we -or, rather, our intellectual descendants-will be the decision makers. If, some other group is supporting the Plan even more efficiently than we are, they cannot be planning to leave the decision-making to us. They will make the decisions-but to what end? Ought we not try to find out what kind of a Second Empire they are sweeping us into?"</p><p>“我们又为何要维护它？我们计划中的第二帝国，是由我们，或者应该说由我们的传人，来担任决策者。倘若有更高明的组织在维护这个计划，他们绝不会把决策权留给我们。他们会自己当家做主，但最终目标又是什么？他们准备为我们打造什么样的第二帝国，难道我们不该设法搞清楚吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And how do you propose to find out?"</p><p>“你又打算如何进行？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, why has the Mayor of Terminus exiled Golan Trevize? By doing so, she allows a possibly dangerous person to move freely about the Galaxy. That she does it out of motives of humanity, I cannot believe. Historically the rulers of the First Foundation have always acted realistically, which means, usually, without regard for `morality.' One of their heroes-Salvor Hardin-counseled against morality, in fact. No, I think the Mayor acted under compulsion from agents of the Anti-Mules, to use your phrase. I think Trevize has been recruited by them and I think he is the spearhead of danger to us. Deadly danger."</p><p>“嗯，端点市长为何要放逐葛兰·崔维兹？这么一来，就让那个具有潜在危险的人物，在银河中自由自在地横冲直撞。若说她这样做是出于人道的动机，我绝对不相信。证诸历史，第一基地的领导人全是现实主义者，这就是说，他们的行为通常都不顾及道德。事实上，他们的一位传奇英雄塞佛·哈定，甚至公开挑战道德观念。所以说，我认为那些反骡——我也借用您的说法——一定控制住了那个市长。我相信崔维兹已经被他们吸收，而且我还相信，他是攻击我们的先锋部队，将带给我们极大的危险。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And the First Speaker said, "By Seldon, you may be right. But how will we ever convince the Table of this?"</p><p>第一发言者说：“谢顿在上，你也许说对了。但是我们要怎样说服圆桌会议？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"First Speaker, you underestimate your eminence."</p><p>“第一发言者，您太低估您的权威了。”</p></div>
