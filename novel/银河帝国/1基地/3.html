<p>PART III <a href="http://www.doc88.com/p-1406546637809.html" title="pdf p57">THE MAYORS</a></p>
<p>第三章 市长</p></div>
<h4>3.1</h4>
<div class='layout'>
<p>THE FOUR KINGDOMS:……The name given to those portions of the Province of Anacreon which broke away from the First Empire in the early years of the Foundational Era to form independent and short-lived kingdoms. The largest and most powerful of these was Anacreon itself which in area……</p>
<p>四王国：……在“基地纪元”早期，安纳克里昂星省自“第一帝国”脱离，形成这四个寿命甚短的独立王国。其中幅员最广、势力最强的，就是安纳克里昂王国，其版图为……</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>……Undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of the history of the Four Kingdoms involves the strange society forced temporarily upon it during the administration of Salvor Hardin……</p>
<p>……四王国的历史中最有趣的局面，无疑是塞佛·哈定执政期间，强行加诸其上的奇异社会形式……</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p>
<p>——《银河百科全书》</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>A deputation!</p>
<p>代表团要来了！</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>That Salvor Hardin had seen it coming made it none the more pleasant. On the contrary, he found anticipation distinctly annoying.</p>
<p>塞佛·哈定早就知道他们会来，这却于事无补。反之，他还感到这种等待十分恼人。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Yohan Lee advocated extreme measures. "I don't see, Hardin," he said, "that we need waste any time. They can't do anything till next election--legally, anyway-- and that gives us a year. Give them the brush-off."</p>
<p>约翰·李主张采取极端手段。“哈定，我认为不该浪费这个时间。”他说，“下次选举之前，他们还不可能有什么作为——我是指合法的作为——所以我们还有一年的缓冲期。现在大可对他们置之不理。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin pursed his lips. "Lee, you'll never learn. In the forty years I've known you, you've never once learned the gentle art of sneaking up from behind."</p>
<p>哈定努起嘴。“约翰，你从来学不会。你认识我已经有四十年，从来没有学会迂回路线的艺术。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It's not my way of fighting," grumbled Lee.</p>
<p>“那可不是我的战略。”约翰发起牢骚。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, I know that. I suppose that's why you're the one man I trust." He paused and reached for a cigar. "We've come a long way, Lee, since we engineered our coup against the Encyclopedists way back. I'm getting old. Sixty-two. Do you ever think how fast those thirty years went?"</p>
<p>“是啊，我知道。我想正因为如此，我才会这么信任你。”说到这里他停了一下，取出一根雪茄，“约翰，自从我们发动政变，罢黜了编纂百科全书的学者，至今已经有好长一段时间。我已经老了，六十二岁了。你有没有想过，这三十年过得有多快？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee snorted. "I don't feel old, and I'm sixty-six."</p>
<p>约翰哼了一声。“我倒不觉得自己老，而我六十六岁了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, but I haven't your digestion." Hardin sucked lazily at his cigar. He had long since stopped wishing for the mild Vegan tobacco of his youth. Those days when the planet, Terminus, had trafficked with every part of the Galactic Empire belonged in the limbo to which all Good Old Days go. Toward the same limbo where the Galactic Empire was heading. He wondered who the new emperor was--or if there was a new emperor at all-- or any Empire. Space! For thirty years now, since the breakup of communications here at the edge of the Galaxy, the whole universe of Terminus had consisted of itself and the four surrounding kingdoms.</p>
<p>“是吗？我可没有像你那么高昂的斗志。”哈定懒洋洋地抽着雪茄——他已经很久未曾妄想来自织女星系的烟草。端点星与银河帝国各处保持贸易的黄金时期，早已成为尘封的记忆，就连银河帝国本身也快要被人遗忘。他不知道帝国现任的皇帝是谁，以及现在究竟还有没有皇帝——甚至，帝国是否还存在呢？太空啊！自从银河系这个角落与其他地区通讯中断，至今已有三十年了，端点星的整个世界，仅仅剩下本身与周围的四个王国而已。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>How the mighty had fallen! Kingdoms! They were prefects in the old days,all part of the same province, which in turn had been part of a sector,which in turn had been part of a quadrant, which in turn had been part of the all embracing Galactic Empire. And now that the Empire had lost control over the farther reaches of the Galaxy, these little splinter groups of planets became kingdoms-- with comic-opera kings and nobles, and petty,meaningless wars, and a life that went on pathetically among the ruins.</p>
<p>帝国的没落太戏剧化了！什么四王国！这些所谓的“王国”，当年只是同一个星省的星郡而已。星省上面还有星区，星区又只是象限的一部分，而各象限集合起来，才是无所不包、无所不容的银河帝国。如今，帝国的统治已经无法到达银河系最外围，这些零落稀疏的行星便组成王国——还产生了滑稽可笑的王公贵族，发生了许多毫无意义的小小战争，造成了废墟中的无数悲惨岁月。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>A civilization falling. Nuclear power forgotten. Science fading tomythology-- until the Foundation had stepped in. The Foundation that Hari Seldon had established for just that purpose here on Terminus.</p>
<p>文明不断衰退，核能已被遗忘，科学变质为神话——直到基地步入这个历史舞台。这个基地，正是哈里·谢顿为了那个长远的目标，而在端点星所建立的“基地”。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee was at the window and his voice broke in on Hardin's reverie. "They've come," he said, "in a late-model ground car, the young pups." He took a few uncertain steps toward the door and then looked at Hardin.</p>
<p>约翰站在窗口，他的声音打断哈定的沉思。“他们来了，”他说，“驾着新式的地面车来的，这些乳臭未干的小子。”他以犹豫的步伐向门口走了几步，又回头望了望哈定。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin smiled, and waved him back. "I've given orders to have them brought up here."</p>
<p>哈定微微一笑，挥手要他回来。“我已下令把他们带到这里来。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Here! What for? You're making them too important."</p>
<p>“这里！为什么？你这样做太抬举他们了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Why go through all the ceremonies of an official mayor's audience? I'mgetting too old for red tape. Besides which, flattery is useful when dealing with youngsters-- particularly when it doesn't commit you to anything." He winked. "Sit down, Lee, and give me your moral backing. I'll need it with this young Sermak."</p>
<p>“何必要他们循官方礼仪，正式拜见市长呢？我太老了，吃不消那些繁文缛节。此外，和年轻人打交道，多捧捧他们还是有好处的——尤其是惠而不费的时候。”他眨眨眼，“约翰，坐下来，给我一点精神上的支持。应付瑟麦克这个年轻人的时候，我还真需要呢。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That fellow, Sermak," said Lee, heavily, "is dangerous. He's got a following, Hardin, so don't underestimate him."</p>
<p>“瑟麦克那家伙非常危险，”约翰以沉重的语气说，“哈定，他有一批追随者，你千万别小看他。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Have I ever underestimated anybody?"</p>
<p>“我什么时候小看过任何人？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well, then, arrest him. You can accuse him of something or other afterward."</p>
<p>“好，那就把他逮捕。你可以事后再找罪名控告他。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin ignored that last bit of advice. "There they are, Lee." In response to the signal, he stepped on the pedal beneath his desk, and the door slid aside.</p>
<p>哈定并未理会最后这句劝告。“约翰，他们来了。”此时叩门的讯号响起，哈定踩下书桌底下的踏板，办公室的门便向一侧滑开。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>They filed in, the four that composed the deputation, and Hardin waved them gently to the armchairs that faced his desk in a semicircle. They bowed and waited for the mayor to speak first.</p>
<p>代表团总共四个人，他们鱼贯走了进来。哈定亲切地挥手，示意他们坐在书桌前排成半圆形的扶手椅上。四位代表鞠躬后就坐，等着市长先开口。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin flicked open the curiously carved silver lid of the cigar box that had once belonged to Jord Fara of the old Board of Trustees in the long-dead days of the Encyclopedists. It was a genuine Empire product from Santanni, though the cigars it now contained were home-grown. One by one,with grave solemnity, the four of the deputation accepted cigars and lit up in ritualistic fashion.</p>
<p>哈定却先打开雪茄盒的银质盖子。这个雪茄盒原本属于当年“百科全书时代”的理事会成员裘德·法拉所有，它是圣塔尼出品的道地帝国货，盖子上面还有精致的雕刻，不过现在里面的雪茄当然是本地产品。四位代表一个个庄重地接过雪茄，并以仪式化的动作点着火。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sef Sermak was second from the right, the youngest of the young group--and the most interesting with his bristly yellow mustache trimmed precisely,and his sunken eyes of uncertain color. The other three Hardin dismissed almost immediately; they were rank and file on the face of them. It was on Sermak that he concentrated, the Sermak who had already, in his first term in the City Council, turned that sedate body topsy-turvy more than once,and it was to Sermak that he said: "I've been particularly anxious to see you, Councilman, ever since your very excellent speech last month. Your attack on the foreign policy of this government was a most capable one."</p>
<p>赛夫·瑟麦克坐在右首第二个位置，他是这批年轻人中年纪最轻，也是看起来最有意思的一位。他蓄着修剪得整整齐齐的金黄色八字胡，深陷的眼珠色泽并不明显。哈定几乎立刻忽略另外三人，由他们的神情看来，就知道他们只是跟班而已。哈定将注意力集中在瑟麦克身上——他是一位新科市议员，却不只一次将严肃的市议会搞得鸡飞狗跳。哈定对着瑟麦克说：“议员先生，自从上个月你发表了那场精彩演说，我就非常希望见见你。你对于政府对外政策所作的攻击，可真是强而有力。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak's eyes smoldered. "Your interest honors me. The attack may or maynot have been capable, but it was certainly justified."</p>
<p>瑟麦克的眼神显得很不满。“能引起你的注意，令我感到很荣幸。姑且不论我作的攻击是否精辟，无论如何它十分正确。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Perhaps! Your opinions are yours, of course. Still you are rather young.</p>
<p>“或许吧！当然，那只是你的个人意见，你还太年轻了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Dryly. "It is a fault that most people are guilty of at some period of their life. You became mayor of the city when you were two years younger than I am now."</p>
<p>对方冷淡地答道：“年轻若是缺点，那么这个缺点，大多数人一生中难免都会经历一阵子。而你比我现在还小两岁的时候，就已经当上市长了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin smiled to himself. The yearling was a cool customer. He said, "I take it now that you have come to see me concerning this same foreign policy that annoys you so greatly in the Council Chamber. Are you speaking for your three colleagues, or must I listen to each of you separately?"</p>
<p>哈定在心里暗笑，这个年轻人的确厉害。他又说：“我想你要见我的目的，仍然是为了你在市议厅拼命反对的对外政策吧。你要代表其余三位同仁呢？还是我得听你们一个个分别发言？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>There were quick mutual glances among the four young men, a slight flickering of eyelids.</p>
<p>四个年轻人互相望了望，迅速交换了几个眼神。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak said grimly, "I speak for the people of Terminus--a people who are not now truly represented in the rubber stamp body they call the Council."</p>
<p>瑟麦克以严肃的口吻说：“我代表端点星的人民发言——如今所谓的议会不能真正代表人民，它只是政府的橡皮图章。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I see. Go ahead, then!"</p>
<p>“我知道了。好，继续说下去！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It comes to this, Mr. Mayor. We are dissatisfied?</p>
<p>“市长先生，事情是这样的，我们并不满意……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"By 'we' you mean 'the people,' don't you?"</p>
<p>“你所谓的‘我们’是指‘人民’，对不对？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak stared hostilely, sensing a trap, and replied coldly, "I believe that my views reflect those of the majority of the voters of Terminus. Does that suit you?"</p>
<p>瑟麦克感到这句话中有陷阱，遂满怀敌意地瞪着对方，然后冷静地答道：“我相信我的意见，反映了端点星大多数选民的心声。这样说你满意吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well, a statement like that is all the better for proof, but go on,anyway. You are dissatisfied."</p>
<p>“嗯，这种说法最好能有真凭实据，但你还是说下去吧。你说你们并不满意？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, dissatisfied with the policy which for thirty years had been stripping Terminus defenseless against the inevitable attack from outside."</p>
<p>“是的，面对必将降临的外来攻击，三十年来，端点星却一直处于不设防的状态，我们就是对这种政策不满。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I see. And therefore? Go on, go on."</p>
<p>“我懂了。因此怎么样？继续，继续。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It's nice of you to anticipate. And therefore we are forming a new political party; one that will stand for the immediate needs of Terminus and not for a mystic 'manifest destiny' of future Empire. We are going to throw you and your lick-spittle clique of appeasers out of City Hall-and that soon."</p>
<p>“感谢你愿意继续听我说。因此，我们决定组成一个新的政党。这个政党是为了应付端点星眼前的需要，而不是为那个未来帝国神秘的‘自明命运’服务。我们要把你以及支持你的姑息人士赶出市政厅——并会速战速决。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Unless? There's always an 'unless,' you know."</p>
<p>“除非？凡事都要附带一句‘除非’，你知道吧。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Not much of one in this case: Unless you resign now. I'm not asking you to change your policies-- I wouldn't trust you that far. Your promises are worth nothing. An outright resignation is all we'll take."</p>
<p>“在这件事里面没什么分别：‘除非’你立刻辞职。我不是来要求你改变政策的——我并没有那么信任你。你的保证一文不值，我们只接受你的无条件辞职。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I see." Hardin crossed his legs and teetered his chair back on two legs."That's your ultimatum. Nice of you to give me warning. But, you see, I rather think I'll ignore it."</p>
<p>“我懂了。”哈定翘起二郎腿，还翘起椅子的两只脚前后摇晃，“这就是你的最后通牒。谢谢你好心来警告我。但是，你知道吗，我决定不加理会。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Don't think it was a warning, Mr. Mayor. It was an announcement of principles and of action. The new party has already been formed, and it will begin its official activities tomorrow. There is neither room nor desire for compromise, and, frankly, it was only our recognition of your services to the City that induced us to offer the easy way out. I didn't think you'd take it, but my conscience is clear. The next election will be a more forcible and quite irresistible reminder that resignation is necessary."</p>
<p>“市长先生，别将它当成警告。这是一项有关原则和行动的宣告。新的政党已经成立，明天就要开始正式活动。我们已经没有妥协的余地和兴趣了，而且坦白说，由于我们体认到你对这个城市的贡献，才特地来向你提出这个简单的解决方案。我也知道你不会接受，但这样我就问心无愧了。下次选举之后，我们所形成的强大压力，就会逼得你非辞职不可。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He rose and motioned the rest up.</p>
<p>他站了起来，并示意其他人一起行动。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin lifted his arm. "Hold on! Sit down!"</p>
<p>哈定马上举起手。“等一等！坐下来！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sef Sermak seated himself once more with just a shade too much alacrity and Hardin smiled behind a straight face. In spite of his words, he was waiting for an offer.</p>
<p>瑟麦克重新坐下，但是动作似乎太急切了些。哈定板着脸，心中却不禁暗笑。他虽然说得那么坚决，其实仍在等待妥协的条件。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin said, "In exactly what way do you want our foreign policy changed? Do you want us to attack the Four Kingdoms, now, at once, and all four simultaneously?"</p>
<p>哈定说：“你们究竟希望我们的对外政策如何改变？要我们攻击各王国吗？立刻同时攻击这四个王国吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I make no such suggestion, Mr. Mayor. It is our simple proposition that all appeasement cease immediately. Throughout your administration, you have carried out a policy of scientific aid to the Kingdoms. You have given them nuclear power. You have helped rebuild power plants on their territories. You have established medical clinics, chemical laboratories and factories."</p>
<p>“市长先生，我并没有那个意思。我们只是主张立刻停止姑息政策，就这么简单。在你执政这段时期，你一直在进行科援诸王国的政策。你提供他们核能，协助他们在域内重建发电厂。此外，你还替他们成立医疗诊所、化学实验室和工厂。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well? And your objection?"</p>
<p>“怎样？你反对什么呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You have done this in order to keep them from attacking us. With these as bribes, you have been playing the fool in a colossal game of blackmail, in which you have allowed Terminus to be sucked dry--with the result that now we are at the mercy of these barbarians."</p>
<p>“你这么做，是为了防止他们攻击我们。在这个大规模的勒索把戏中，你一直扮演着傻子的角色，只知道不断贿赂他们。你默许端点星被他们吃干抹净——结果，那些蛮子现在视我们为囊中物。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"In what way?"</p>
<p>“这话怎么说？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Because you have given them power, given them weapons, actually serviced the ships of their navies, they are infinitely stronger than they were three decades ago. Their demands are increasing, and with their new weapons, they will eventually satisfy all their demands at once by violent annexation of Terminus. Isn't that the way blackmail usually ends?"</p>
<p>“因为你给他们能源、给他们武器，实际上等于协助他们维修星际舰队，让他们比三十年前强大得太多了。他们的胃口也越来越大，最后他们一定会用新式武器吞并端点星，一口气满足所有的需索。勒索行动的结局大都如此，对不对？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And your remedy?"</p>
<p>“那么你们的补救办法呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Stop the bribes immediately and while you can. Spend your effort in strengthening Terminus itself--and attack first!"</p>
<p>“趁着还来得及的时候，立刻停止贿赂。将你的心力用在强化端点星的武装上，然后主动出击！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin watched the young fellow's little blond mustache with an almost morbid interest. Sermak felt sure of himself or he wouldn't talk so much. There was no doubt that his remarks were the reflection of a pretty huge segment of the population, pretty huge.</p>
<p>哈定用近乎诡异的目光，看着这个年轻人的金黄八字胡。瑟麦克很有自信，否则不会这么滔滔不绝。而他所提出的主张，无疑反映了相当多人的想法——一定相当多。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>His voice did not betray the slightly perturbed current of his thoughts. If was almost negligent. "Are you finished?"</p>
<p>哈定的思绪稍微有些混乱，但他仍然装得若无其事，声音听来满不在乎。“你说完了吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"For the moment."</p>
<p>“暂时告一段落。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well, then, do you notice the framed statement I have on the wall behind me? Read it, if you will!"</p>
<p>“那么，你可看到我后面的墙上框着的那句话？劳驾你念一下！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak's lips twitched. "It says: 'Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' That's an old man's doctrine, Mr. Mayor."</p>
<p>瑟麦克撇着嘴念道：“那上面写着：‘武力是无能者最后的手段’。市长先生，这是老年人的信条。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>I applied it as a young man, Mr. Councilman--and successfully. You were busily being born when it happened, but perhaps you may have read something of it in school.</p>
<p>“议员先生，我在年轻时就奉行这个信条——而且非常成功。那时你正忙着从妈妈肚子里爬出来，但或许你在学校里读过这段历史吧。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He eyed Sermak closely and continued in measured tones, "When Hari Seldon established the Foundation here, it was for the ostensible purpose of producing a great Encyclopedia, and for fifty years we followed that will-of-the-wisp, before discovering what he was really after. By that time, it was almost too late. When communications with the central regions of the old Empire broke down, we found ourselves a world of scientists concentrated in a single city, possessing no industries, and surrounded by newly created kingdoms, hostile and largely barbarous. We were a tiny island of nuclear power in this ocean of barbarism, and an infinitely valuable prize.</p>
<p>哈定紧盯着瑟麦克，以慎重的语气继续说：“当年哈里·谢顿在这里建立基地，表面上的目的是编纂一套伟大的百科全书，我们为这个影子目标努力了五十年，然后才发现他真正的目的。那时，几乎已经太迟了。当我们和帝国核心区域失去联络之后，我们成了由科学家聚集的单一城市所构成的世界，完全没有任何工业。我们周围是新兴的野蛮王国，个个对我们充满敌意。我们是蛮荒汪洋中的核能小岛，当然成了邻邦觊觎的珍贵目标。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Anacreon, then as now, the most powerful of the Four Kingdoms, demanded and later actually established a military base upon Terminus, and the then rulers of the City, the Encyclopedists, knew very well that this was only a preliminary to taking over the entire planet. That is how matters stood when I ... uh ... assumed actual government. What would you have done?"</p>
<p>“在四王国中，安纳克里昂始终是最强大的。当年他们曾经要求在端点星建立军事基地，不久也的确实现了。当时统治端点市的那些百科全书编者，完全明白那只是他们占领整个行星的第一步。就是在这种情况下，我……嗯……实际接管了政府。换成你会怎么做呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak shrugged his shoulders. "That's an academic question. Of course, I know what you did."</p>
<p>瑟麦克耸耸肩。“这纯粹是个理论上的问题，我当然知道你是怎么做的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I'll repeat it, anyway. Perhaps you don't get the point. The temptation was great to muster what force we could and put up a fight. It's the easiest way out, and the most satisfactory to self-respect--but, nearly invariably, the stupidest. You would have done it; you and your talk of'attack first.' What I did, instead, was to visit the three other kingdoms,one by one; point out to each that to allow the secret of nuclear power to fall into the hands of Anacreon was the quickest way of cutting their own throats; and suggest gently that they do the obvious thing. That was all. One month after the Anacreonian force had landed on Terminus, their king received a joint ultimatum from his three neighbors. In seven days, the last Anacreonian was off Terminus.</p>
<p>“让我再说一遍，也许你还不了解其中的关键。当时谁都不禁会想到，最好集结所有的力量和敌人作殊死战。这是最简单的，也是最能满足自尊的做法——但是，也必然是最愚笨的。换成你，很可能就会这么做，正如你刚才所谓的‘主动出击’。但是我的做法，却是轮流拜访其他三个王国，向他们指出，如果让核能的机密落入安纳克里昂手中，无疑等于割断他们自己的喉咙。然后，我又委婉地建议他们采取一个明显的措施，如此而已。结果在安纳克里昂的军队登陆端点星一个月之后，他们的国王就接到其他三国的联合最后通牒。七天内，安纳克里昂人就全部撤离了端点星。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Now tell me, where was the need for violence?"</p>
<p>“请你告诉我，又何尝需要用到武力？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The young councilman regarded his cigar stub thoughtfully and tossed it into the incinerator chute. "I fail to see the analogy. Insulin will bringa diabetic to normal without the faintest need of a knife, but appendicitis needs an operation. You can't help that. When other courses have failed,what is left but, as you put it, the last refuge? It's your fault that we're driven to it."</p>
<p>年轻议员若有所思地盯着雪茄头，然后将它丢进焚化槽。“我不觉得这两件事能相提并论。糖尿病患可以用胰岛素治疗，根本不用开刀，阑尾炎却一定需要动手术。这是谁都无法改变的。当其他办法通通失效时，最后剩下的一条路，不就是你所谓的‘最后的手段’？都是由于你的错误，才把我们逼上这条路。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I? Oh, yes, again my policy of appeasement. You still seem to lack grasp of the fundamental necessities of our position. Our problem wasn't over with the departure of the Anacreonians. They had just begun. The Four Kingdoms were more our enemies than ever, for each wanted nuclear power-and each was kept off our throats only for fear of the other three. We are balanced on the point of a very sharp sword, and the slightest sway in any direction-- If, for instance, one kingdom becomes too strong; or if two form a coalition--You understand?"</p>
<p>“我？喔，又是指我的姑息政策。你似乎仍不了解我们当时的情况和基本需要。安纳克里昂人离去后，我们的问题并未结束，而是刚刚开始。从此，四王国变得比以前更具敌意，因为每个王国都想夺取核能——由于害怕其他三国，才不敢对我们下手。我们在利刃的尖端保持平衡，倘若有丝毫偏差——例如某王国变得太强，或有两个王国结盟——你懂我的意思吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Certainly. That was the time to begin all-out preparations for war."</p>
<p>“当然懂。那时就应该全力准备应战。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"On the contrary. That was the time to begin all-out prevention of war. I played them one against the other. I helped each in turn. I offered them science, trade, education, scientific medicine. I made Terminus of more value to them as a flourishing world than as a military prize. It worked for thirty years."</p>
<p>“正好相反，那时应该全力防止开启战端。我让他们互相对立，并且分别协助他们，提供他们科学、贸易、教育、正统医疗等等。我使他们感到，让端点星成为一个繁荣的世界，要比作为一个战利品更有价值。这个政策维持了三十年的和平。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, but you were forced to surround these scientific gifts with the most outrageous mummery. You've made half religion, half balderdash out of it. You've erected a hierarchy of priests and complicated, meaningless ritual."</p>
<p>“是的，但你被迫用最可耻的形式来包装那些科援。你把它弄成宗教和鬼话的混合体，你还扶植了教士阶级，并且发明繁琐而毫无意义的仪典。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin frowned. "What of that? I don't see that it has anything to do with the argument at all. I started that way at first because the barbarians looked upon our science as a sort of magical sorcery, and it was easiest to get them to accept it on that basis. The priesthood built itself and if we help it along we are only following the line of least resistance. It is a minor matter."</p>
<p>哈定皱皱眉。“那又怎么样？我看不出它跟这个问题有什么关系。我最初那样做，是因为那些蛮子把我们的科学视为魔法，所以那种形式最容易让他们接受。教士阶级是自然形成的，若说我们出过力，也只是因势利导而已。这实在是微不足道的小事。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"But these priests are in charge of the power plants. That is not a minor matter."</p>
<p>“但是由那些教士来掌管发电厂，就不是小事了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"True, but we have trained them. Their knowledge of their tools is purely empirical; and they have a firm belief in the mummery that surrounds them."</p>
<p>“没错，可是仍由我们来训练。他们对于各种机器的知识全是经验法则，对于包在机器外面的宗教外衣深信不疑。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And if one pierces through the mummery, and has the genius to brush aside empiricism, what is to prevent him from learning actual techniques, and selling out to the most satisfactory bidder? What price our value to the kingdoms, then?"</p>
<p>“万一有人识破了宗教的外衣，并且超越了经验法则呢，你又如何制止他学习到真正的科技，再兜售给出价最高的一方？那时候，我们对各王国还有什么价值呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Little chance of that, Sermak. You are being superficial. The best men on the planets of the kingdoms are sent here to the Foundation each year and educated into the priesthood. And the best of these remain here as research students. If you think that those who are left, with practically no knowledge of the elements of science, or worse, still, with the distorted knowledge the priests receive, can penetrate at a bound to nuclear power,to electronics, to the theory of the hyperwarp-- you have a very romanticand very foolish idea of science. It takes lifetimes of training and an excellent brain to get that far."</p>
<p>“瑟麦克，几乎没有这个可能。你只看到了表面。四王国每年都选派最优秀的人员，来端点星接受教士培训教育，成绩最佳的还会留在这里继续深造。假如你以为那些留下来的教士——他们不但连一点科学基础都没有，更糟的是，所学到的还是刻意扭曲的知识——居然能参透核能工程、电子学和超曲速的理论，那么你对科学的看法就太浪漫、太愚蠢了。要达到这种境界，必须接受一辈子的训练，再加上一个聪明的脑袋才行。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Yohan Lee had risen abruptly during the foregoing speech and left the room. He had returned now and when Hardin finished speaking, he bent to his superior's ear. A whisper was exchanged and then a leaden cylinder. Then,with one short hostile look at the deputation, Lee resumed his chair.</p>
<p>当哈定滔滔不绝时，约翰·李曾经突然站起来走出去，现在才又回来。哈定刚说完话，约翰便凑到这位上司耳边，说了一句耳语，并交给哈定一根铅筒。然后，约翰狠狠地瞪了代表团一眼，才坐回他的原位。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin turned the cylinder end for end in his hands, watching th edeputation through his lashes. And then he opened it with a hard, sudden twist and only Sermak had the sense not to throw a rapid look at the rolled paper that fell out.</p>
<p>哈定双手来回转弄那根圆筒，又眯着眼看了看代表团的成员。然后他突然用力一扭，将圆筒打开来。只有瑟麦克一个人忍住好奇心，没有向滚出的纸卷瞄上一眼。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"In short, gentlemen," he said, "the Government is of the opinion that it knows what it is doing."</p>
<p>“各位，总而言之，”哈定说，“政府自认了解自己在做什么。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He read as he spoke. There were the lines of intricate, meaningless code that covered the page and the three penciled words scrawled in one comer that carried the message. He took it in at a glance and tossed it casually into the incinerator shaft.</p>
<p>他一面说一面读着。纸卷上写满许多行复杂而无意义的符号，但只有在一角用铅笔写的三个字，才传递了真正的讯息。哈定只瞄了一眼，就随手将它丢进焚化槽。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That," Hardin then said, "ends the interview, I'm afraid. Glad to have met you all. Thank you for coming." He shook hands with each in perfunctory fashion, and they filed out.</p>
<p>“只怕会面该结束了。”哈定说，“很高兴见到各位，谢谢你们的光临。”他敷衍地跟四个人一一握手，他们便鱼贯而出。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin had almost gotten out of the habit of laughing, but after Sermak and his three silent partners were well out of earshot, he indulged in a dry chuckle and bent an amused look on Lee.</p>
<p>哈定几乎忍不住又要哈哈大笑，但直到瑟麦克与三名年轻伙伴走远之后，他才放纵地“咯咯”干笑几声，并对约翰露出愉快的笑容。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"How did you like that battle of bluffs, Lee?"</p>
<p>“约翰，你喜欢刚才那场吹牛比赛吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee snorted grumpily. "I'm not sure that he was bluffing. Treat him with kid gloves and he's quite liable to win the next election, just as he says."</p>
<p>约翰不高兴地哼了一声。“我可不认为他在吹牛。你得小心对付他，下次选举他很可能会胜利，正如他所声称的那样。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Oh, quite likely, quite likely-- if nothing happens first."</p>
<p>“嗯，很可能，很可能——如果在此之前，什么也没发生的话。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Make sure they don't happen in the wrong direction this time, Hardin. I tell you this Sermak has a following. What if he doesn't wait till the next election? There was a time when you and I put things through violently, inspite of your slogan about what violence is."</p>
<p>“哈定，这次要小心别弄巧成拙。我说过，这个瑟麦克拥有一批追随者。万一他在下次选举之前就采取行动呢？你我也曾使用武力达到目的，虽然你口口声声反对武力。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin cocked an eyebrow. "You are pessimistic today, Lee. And singularly contrary, too, or you wouldn't speak of violence. Our own little putsch was carried through without loss of life, you remember. It was a necessary measure put through at the proper moment, and went over smoothly,painlessly, and all but effortlessly. As for Sermak, he's up against a different proposition. You and I, Lee, aren't the Encyclopedists. We stand prepared. Order your men onto these youngsters in a nice way, old fellow. Don't let them know they're being watched--but eyes open, you understand."</p>
<p>哈定扬起一边的眉毛。“约翰，你今天非常悲观。而且也非常矛盾，否则你不会提到武力。还记得吧，当年我们的小小政变，没有令任何人丧命。那是在适当时机所采取的必要手段，过程平和、毫无痛苦，几乎不费吹灰之力。至于瑟麦克，他反对的和我们当年完全不同。你我可不是百科全书编者，我们有万全准备。老战友，派你的部下好好盯着他们。别让他们知道自己受到监视——但眼睛放亮点，明白吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee laughed in sour amusement. "I'd be a fine one to wait for your orders,wouldn't I, Hardin? Sermak and his men have been under surveillance for a month now."</p>
<p>约翰苦笑几声。“哈定，我如果事事要等你下令，那也太差劲了，对不对？瑟麦克和他的手下，已经被监视一个月了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The mayor chuckled. "Got in first, did you? All right. By the way," he observed, and added softly, "Ambassador Verisof is returning to Terminus. Temporarily, I hope."</p>
<p>市长咯咯笑了起来。“你先下手为强啊？很好。对了，”他又轻声补充道，“维瑞索夫大使即将回到端点星，我希望他只是暂时停留。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>There was a short silence, faintly horrified, and then Lee said, "Was that the message? Are things breaking already?"</p>
<p>约翰沉默了一下子，似乎有点担心，然后才问：“刚才收到的讯息就是这件事吗？事情已经爆发了吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Don't know. I can't tell till I hear what Verisof has to say. They may be,though. After all, they have to before election. But what are you looking so dead about?"</p>
<p>“我不知道。在没见到维瑞索夫之前，我什么都不清楚。不过，也许真的爆发了吧。毕竟，那些事必须在选举之前发生。你怎么脸色那么难看？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Because I don't know how it's going to turn out. You're too deep, Hardin,and you're playing the game too close to your chest."</p>
<p>“因为我不知道事情会有什么结果。哈定，你太深沉了，什么事都藏在心底。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Even you?" murmured Hardin. And aloud, "Does that mean you're going to join Sermak's new party?"</p>
<p>“连你也这么说？”哈定喃喃道，接着又提高音量说：“这是否代表你也要参加瑟麦克的新政党？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee smiled against his will. "All right. You win. How about lunch now?"</p>
<p>约翰只好勉强挤出笑容。“好吧，好吧，算你赢了。我们去吃午餐如何？”</p></div>
<h4>3.2</h4>


<div class='layout'>
<p>There are many epigrams attributed to Hardin--a confirmed epigrammatist--a good many of which are probably apocryphal. Nevertheless, it is reported that on a certain occasion, he said:</p>
<p>哈定被公认是一位出口成章的人，不少格言警语据说都出自其口，不过有许多可能是伪托的。无论如何，据说他曾在某个场合，说过下面这句话：</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety.</p>
<p>“光明磊落总有好处，尤其对那些以卖弄玄虚着称的人。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Poly Verisof had had occasion to act on that advice more than once for he was now in the fourteenth year of his double status on Anacreon--a double status the upkeep of which reminded him often and unpleasantly of a dance performed barefoot on hot metal.</p>
<p>波利·维瑞索夫曾经多次遵照这句忠告行事，因为他已经以双重身份在安纳克里昂待了十四年——维持那种双重身份就好像是赤脚在灼热的金属上跳舞。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>To the people of Anacreon he was high priest, representative of that Foundation which, to those "barbarians," was the acme of mystery and the physical center of this religion they had created--with Hardin's help--in the last three decades. As such, he received a homage that had become horribly wearying, for from his soul he despised the ritual of which he wasthe center.</p>
<p>对于安纳克里昂人民而言，他是一位教长，是基地派来的代表。在他们那些“蛮子”心目中，基地是一切神秘的根源，也是他们的宗教圣地——这个宗教是借着哈定的助力，在过去三十年间所建立的。由于这个身份，维瑞索夫自然受到极度的尊敬。他却觉得无聊得可怕，因为他打心底讨厌那些以他自己为中心的宗教仪典。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>But to the King of Anacreon-- the old one that had been, and the young grandson that was now on the throne-- he was simply the ambassador of a power at once feared and coveted.</p>
<p>但是安纳克里昂的国王——不论是已去世的老国王或是他目前在位的孙子，他们都将维瑞索夫视为基地这个强权派来的大使，对他的态度是又迎又惧。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>On the whole, it was an uncomfortable job, and his first trip to the Foundation in three years, despite the disturbing incident that had made it necessary, was something in the nature of a holiday.</p>
<p>整体而言，这是一份吃力不讨好的工作。今天是三年来第一次回基地，他是抱着度假的心情回来的，虽然那些麻烦的意外也非要他回来一趟不可。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And since it was not the first time he had had to travel in absolute secrecy, he again made use of Hardin's epigram on the uses of the obvious.</p>
<p>由于并非首次必须在绝对机密的情况下旅行，他又采取了哈定“光明磊落”的策略。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He changed into his civilian clothes--a holiday in itself--and boarded a passenger liner to the Foundation, second class. Once at Terminus, he threaded his way through the crowd at the spaceport and called up City Hall at a public visiphone.</p>
<p>他脱下神职人员的法衣，换上了便服——这样做已经算是度假。然后他搭乘定期太空客船回到基地，还故意坐二等舱。刚抵达端点星的太空航站，他就赶紧穿过拥挤的人潮，走到公共影像电话亭，打电话到市政厅去。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He said, "My name is Jan Smite. I have an appointment with the mayor this afternoon."</p>
<p>他说：“我名叫简·史迈，今天下午和市长有约。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The dead-voiced but efficient young lady at the other end made a second connection and exchanged a few rapid words, then said to Verisof in dry,mechanical tone, "Mayor Hardin will see you in half an hour, sir," and the screen went blank.</p>
<p>接电话的是一位声调平板无力、办事效率却很高的年轻女子。她立即打了另一通电话请示，然后用干涩、单调的声音告诉维瑞索夫说：“先生，哈定市长将在半小时后见您。”然后荧光屏上的画面便消失了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Whereupon the ambassador to Anacreon bought the latest edition of the Terminus City Journal, sauntered casually to City Hall Park and, sitting.down on the first empty bench he came to, read the editorial page, sportsection and comic sheet while waiting. At the end of half an hour, he tucked the paper under his arm, entered City Hall and presented himself in the anteroom.</p>
<p>挂上电话后，这位驻安纳克里昂大使买了一份最新的《端点市日报》，悠闲地踱到市政厅公园，坐在他找到的第一张长椅上，阅读报上的新闻评论、体育版与漫画来打发时间。半小时后，他把报纸挟在腋下，走进了市政厅的会客室。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>In doing all this he remained safely and thoroughly unrecognized, for since he was so entirely obvious, no one gave him a second look.</p>
<p>在此期间，根本没有任何人认出他来。因为他的一切行动光明磊落，谁也没有想要多看他一眼。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin looked up at him and grinned. "Have a cigar! How was the trip?"</p>
<p>哈定抬起头，咧嘴一笑。“请抽根雪茄吧！旅途愉快吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Verisof helped himself. "Interesting. There was a priest in the next cabinon his way here to take a special course in the preparation of radioactive synthetics--for the treatment of cancer, you know--"</p>
<p>维瑞索夫取了一根雪茄。“很有趣。我的邻舱有位教士，他要来基地接受放射性合成物质使用的特别训练——你知道吧，那是用来治疗癌症的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Surely, he didn't call it radioactive synthetics, now?"</p>
<p>“想必他不会称之为‘放射性合成物质’吧？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I guess not! It was the Holy Food to him."</p>
<p>“我想一定不会！对他来说，那是一种‘圣粮’。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The mayor smiled. "Go on."</p>
<p>市长微微一笑。“请继续。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"He inveigled me into a theological discussion and did his level best to elevate me out of sordid materialism."</p>
<p>“他诱使我跟他讨论灵学问题，并且想尽办法，要使我从卑鄙龌龊的唯物主义中得救。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And never recognized his own high priest?"</p>
<p>“而他一直没有发觉你是他的教长？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Without my crimson robe? Besides, he was a Smyrnian. It was an interestingexperience, though. It is remarkable, Hardin, how the religion of sciencehas grabbed hold. I've written an essay on the subject--entirely for myown amusement; it wouldn't do to have it published. Treating the problemsociologically, it would seem that when the old Empire began to rot at thefringes, it could be considered that science, as science, had failed theouter worlds. To be reaccepted it would have to present itself in anotherguise and it has done just that. It works out beautifully."</p>
<p>“我没穿深红色法衣，他怎么认得出来？何况，他是司密尔诺人。不过，那是一次有趣的经历。哈定，这实在太神奇了，科学性宗教已经牢固地深植人心。我写过一篇文章讨论这个现象——纯粹是自己写着好玩，并不适合发表。我以社会学的眼光来研究这个问题，当旧帝国在银河外缘开始瓦解时，就科学本身而言，它似乎也开始在这些世界消失。为了使科学再度为人接受，它就必须以另一种面貌出现——这正是我们的做法，它的确很成功。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Interesting!" The mayor placed his arms around his neck and said suddenly,"Start talking about the situation at Anacreon!"</p>
<p>“真有意思！”市长把两手交叉放在颈后，突然说：“谈谈安纳克里昂的情况吧！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The ambassador frowned and withdrew the cigar from his mouth. He looked atit distastefully and put it down. "Well, it's pretty bad."</p>
<p>大使皱起眉头，把雪茄从口中取出来，不以为然地看了看，再放到一旁。“嗯，情况很不好。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You wouldn't be here, otherwise."</p>
<p>“否则，你也不会赶回来。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Scarcely. Here's the position. The key man at Anacreon is the PrinceRegent, Wienis. He's King Lepold's uncle."</p>
<p>“差不多。情况是这样的：安纳克里昂的关键人物是摄政王温尼斯，他是列普德国王的叔父。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I know. But Lepold is coming of age next year, isn't he? I believe he'llbe sixteen in February."</p>
<p>“我知道。但列普德不是明年就成年了吗？我记得他明年二月就满十六岁了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes." Pause, and then a wry addition. "If he lives. The king's father diedunder suspicious circumstances. A needle bullet through the chest during ahunt. It was called an accident."</p>
<p>“没错。”维瑞索夫顿了顿，再以挖苦的语气补充：“前提是他能活到那时候。他父亲的死因极为可疑，是在狩猎时被针弹射穿胸部，官方的说法是意外丧生。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Hmph. I seem to remember Wienis the time I was on Anacreon, when we kickedthem off Terminus. It was before your time. Let's see now. If I remember,he was a dark young fellow, black hair and a squint in his right eye. Hehad a funny hook in his nose."</p>
<p>“唔。我在安纳克里昂的时候，好像也见过温尼斯。那时我们刚把安纳克里昂人赶出端点星，而你还没有上任。让我想一想，如果我记得没错，他是个皮肤黝黑的小伙子，黑发，右眼斜视，还有一个滑稽的鹰勾鼻。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Same fellow. The hook and the squint are still there, but his hair's graynow. He plays the game dirty. Luckily, he's the most egregious fool on theplanet. Fancies himself as a shrewd devil, too, which mades his folly themore transparent."</p>
<p>“就是他。鹰勾鼻和斜眼都还在，但是头发如今灰白了。他行事卑鄙无耻，但好在他是那颗行星上的头号大笨蛋。他同样自以为聪明机灵，却使得他的愚蠢更加透明。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That's usually the way."</p>
<p>“通常都是这样。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"His notion of cracking an egg is to shoot a nuclear blast at it. Witnessthe tax on Temple property he tried to impose just after the old king diedtwo years ago. Remember?"</p>
<p>“他的信念是杀鸡也得用核炮。最明显的例子是两年前老国王刚死的时候，他试图对灵殿的财产课税。你还记得吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin nodded thoughtfully, then smiled. "The priests raised a howl."</p>
<p>哈定感慨万千地点点头，然后露出微笑。“教士们曾经反弹。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"They raised one you could hear way out to Lucreza. He's shown more cautionin dealing with the priesthood since, but he still manages to do things thehard way. In a way, it's unfortunate for us; he has unlimitedself-confidence."</p>
<p>“他们的反弹声浪，在银河另一端都听得见。自从那次事件之后，他就对教士更加提防，不过还是不改他的强硬作风。就某方面来说，这对我们不利，他实在是无限度地自信。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Probably an over-compensated inferiority complex. Younger sons of royaltyget that way, you know."</p>
<p>“也许是一种过度补偿的自卑情结吧。王储的弟弟往往有这种倾向，你知道的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"But it amounts to the same thing. He's foaming at the mouth with eagernessto attack the Foundation. He scarcely troubles to conceal it. And he's in aposition to do it, too, from the standpoint of armament. The old king builtup a magnificent navy, and Wienis hasn't been sleeping the last two years.In fact, the tax on Temple property was originally intended for furtherarmament, and when that fell through he increased the income tax twice."</p>
<p>“但两者殊途同归。他就像只疯狗，极力主张进攻基地，自己从不掩饰这个企图。从军备观点而言，他也的确有这个能力。老国王生前建立了强大的星际舰队，温尼斯这两年也没闲着。事实上，他当初想对灵殿的财产课税，也是为了扩充军备。这个企图失败之后，他竟然把所得税提高了一倍。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Any grumbling at that?"</p>
<p>“有没有人抱怨呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"None of serious importance. Obedience to appointed authority was the textof every sermon in the kingdom for weeks. Not that Wienis showed anygratitude."</p>
<p>“并没有任何激烈的抗议。服从圣灵所属意的威权，是王国内每场布道必有的讲题。但是温尼斯并不领情。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"All right. I've got? the background. Now what's happened?"</p>
<p>“好，我知道背景了。现在告诉我，究竟发生了什么事？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Two weeks ago an Anacreonian merchant ship came across a derelict battlecruiser of the old Imperial Navy. It must have been drifting in space forat least three centuries."</p>
<p>“两星期之前，安纳克里昂商船发现了一艘帝国星际舰队弃置的巡弋舰，它在太空里至少飘荡了三个世纪。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Interest flickered in Hardin's eyes. He sat up. "Yes, I've heard of that. The Board of Navigation has sent me a petition asking me to obtain the shipfor purposes of study. It is in good condition, I understand."</p>
<p>哈定眼中闪耀出兴致勃勃的光芒，他立刻坐直身子。“对，我也听说了。宇航局曾经向我提出申请，希望能得到那艘星舰作研究之用。它的情况良好，我很清楚。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"In entirely too good condition," responded Verisof, dryly. "When Wienisreceived your suggestion last week that he turn the ship over to theFoundation, he almost had convulsions."</p>
<p>“完全处于最佳状况。”维瑞索夫冷冷地应道，“上星期，你写信建议他把那艘巡弋舰交给基地，温尼斯收信后，简直要气炸了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"He hasn't answered yet."</p>
<p>“他还没有答复呢。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"He won't--except with guns, or so he thinks. You see, he came to me onthe day I left Anacreon and requested that the Foundation put this battlecruiser into fighting order and turn it over to the Anacreonian navy. Hehad the infernal gall to say that your note of last week indicated a planof the Foundation's to attack Anacreon. He said that refusal to repair thebattle cruiser would confirm his suspicions; and indicated that measuresfor the self-defense of Anacreon would be forced upon him. Those are hiswords. Forced upon him! And that's why I'm here."</p>
<p>“他不会答复的——除非用枪炮答复你。你可知道，在我离开安纳克里昂那一天，他曾经来找我，要求基地把那艘巡弋舰整修至战备状态，再交还安纳克里昂星际舰队。他厚颜无耻地说，你上星期送去的信，代表基地有攻击安纳克里昂的企图。他还说假如我们拒绝修理巡弋舰，就证明他的怀疑是事实。为了安纳克里昂的安全，他将被迫采取自卫行动。他就是这么说的——被迫采取自卫行动！所以我只好赶回来了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin laughed gently.</p>
<p>哈定轻轻笑了几声。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Verisof smiled and continued, "Of course, he expects a refusal, and itwould be a perfect excuse-- in his eyes-- for immediate attack."</p>
<p>维瑞索夫也微微一笑，继续说：“当然，他在等待我们拒绝。在他看来，那是立即进军的最佳借口。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I see that, Verisof. Well, we have at least six months to spare, so havethe ship fixed up and present it with my compliments. Have it renamed theWienis as a mark of our esteem and affection."</p>
<p>“维瑞索夫，我了解了。好吧，我们至少还有六个月的时间，所以不妨把巡弋舰修理好，再恭敬地送还给他们。为了表示我们的敬意和友善，把它重新命名为‘温尼斯号’吧。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He laughed again.</p>
<p>哈定又笑了几声。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And again Verisof responded with the faintest trace of a smile, "I supposeit's the logical step, Hardin--but I'm worried."</p>
<p>维瑞索夫仍然以一丝笑意回应。“哈定，我相信这是合理的做法——但我有些担心。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"What about?"</p>
<p>“担心什么？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It's a ship! They could build in those days. Its cubic capacity is halfagain that of the entire Anacreonian navy. It's got nuclear blasts capableof blowing up a planet, and a shield that could take a Q-beam withoutworking up radiation. Too much of a good thing, Hardin?--</p>
<p>“那是一艘星舰！是帝国当年才能建造的星际巡弋舰。它的容量相当于安纳克里昂舰队总容量的1.5倍；它配备有足以摧毁整个行星的核炮，还有能抵抗Ｑ能束、完全不产生辐射的防护罩。哈定，那艘星舰实在太好了……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Superficial, Verisof, superficial. You and I both know that the armamenthe now has could defeat Terminus handily, long before we could repair thecruiser for our own use. What does it matter, then, if we give him thecruiser as well? You know it won't ever come to actual war."</p>
<p>“维瑞索夫，那只是表面上，表面上如此。你我都知道，以他现有的兵力，想要攻击端点星是轻而易举，我们根本来不及修好那艘巡弋舰当防御武器。那么，把它送给温尼斯又有什么关系呢？而且你也知道，根本不会发生真正的战争。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I suppose so. Yes." The ambassador looked up. "But Hardin--</p>
<p>“没错，我也这么想。”大使抬起头，“可是，哈定……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well? Why do you stop? Go ahead."</p>
<p>“怎样？为什么停下来？继续说啊。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Look. This isn't my province. But I've been reading the paper." He placedthe Journal on the desk and indicated the front page. "What's this allabout?"</p>
<p>“好的，虽然这不是我的份内之事。但是我从报纸上看到……”他把日报放在桌上，指着第一版说：“这到底是怎么回事？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin dropped a casual glance. "'A group of Councilmen are forming a newpolitical party."'</p>
<p>哈定随便瞄了一眼。“一群市议员准备组建一个新的政党。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That's what it says." Verisof fidgeted. "I know you're in better touchwith internal matters than I am, but they're attacking you with everythingshort of physical violence. How strong are they?"</p>
<p>“上面是这么写的。”维瑞索夫坐立不安，“我知道内政方面你比我清楚，但是除了尚未诉诸武力，他们用尽一切方法在攻击你。他们的势力究竟多大？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Damned strong. They'll probably control the Council after next election."</p>
<p>“还真他妈的强。下次选举之后，他们可能就会控制议会。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Not before?" Verisof looked at the mayor obliquely. "There are ways ofgaining control besides elections."</p>
<p>“不是选举之前？”维瑞索夫斜眼望着市长，“除了选举之外，还有不少夺取政权的办法。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Do you take me for Wienis?"</p>
<p>“你把我看成温尼斯了？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No. But repairing the ship will take months and an attack after that iscertain. Our yielding will be taken as a sign of appalling weakness and theaddition of the Imperial Cruiser will just about double the strength ofWienis' navy. He'll attack as sure as I'm a high priest. Why take chances? Do one of two things. Either reveal the plan of campaign to the Council, or force the issue with Anacreon now!"</p>
<p>“当然没有。可是修理星舰需要好几个月，而且修好后攻击必然随之而来。我们的让步会被当成一种极度懦弱的迹象，何况一旦拥有帝国巡弋舰，温尼斯的舰队会增强一倍实力。到时候他一定会发动攻击，这就跟我的教长头衔一样确凿。我们何必冒险呢？你现在只有两个选择，一是把我们的计划告知议会，二是现在就逼安纳克里昂摊牌！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin frowned. "Force the issue now? Before the crisis comes? It's the onething I mustn't do. There's Hari Seldon and the Plan, you know."</p>
<p>哈定皱起眉头。“现在就逼他们摊牌？在危机来临之前？我绝不会那样做。你别忘了哈里·谢顿和他的计划。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Verisof hesitated, then muttered, "You're absolutely sure, then, that thereis a Plan?"</p>
<p>维瑞索夫犹豫了一下，然后喃喃道：“这么说，你绝对相信有那个计划的存在？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"There can scarcely be any doubt," came the stiff reply. "I was present atthe opening of the Time Vault and Seldon's recording revealed it then."</p>
<p>“这几乎是不容怀疑的。”哈定断然地回答，“当年‘时光穹窿’开启时我也在场，而谢顿的录像透露了这个秘密。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I didn't mean that, Hardin. I just don't see how it could be possible tochart history for a thousand years ahead. Maybe Seldon overestimatedhimself." He shriveled a bit at Hardin's ironical smile, and added, "Well,I'm no psychologist,"</p>
<p>“哈定，我不是指那个。我只是不懂，他怎么可能预测往后一千年的历史。也许只是谢顿过于自信吧。”看到哈定露出讥讽的微笑，维瑞索夫有点心虚，补充了一句：“好吧，我又不是心理学家。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Exactly. None of us are. But I did receive some elementary training in myyouth--enough to know what psychology is capable of, even if I can'texploit its capabilities myself. There's no doubt but that Seldon didexactly what he claims to have done. The Foundation, as he says, wasestablished as a scientific refuge--the means by which the science andculture of the dying Empire was to be preserved through the centuries ofbarbarism that have begun, to be rekindled in the end into a secondEmpire."</p>
<p>“没错，我们都不是。但我在年轻的时候，的确受过一些基本训练——足以让我了解心理学的能耐，即使我自己无法善加利用。哈里·谢顿的确做到了他所宣称的事，这点无庸置疑。正如他所说，基地的建立是为科学提供一个避难所——在新兴的蛮荒世纪中，用以保存逝去帝国的科学和文化，以待重新发扬光大，建立第二帝国。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Verisof nodded, a trifle doubtfully. "Everyone knows that's the way thingsare supposed to go. But can we afford to take chances? Can we risk thepresent for the sake of a nebulous future?"</p>
<p>维瑞索夫点点头，但还是有点怀疑。“每个人都知道事情应该会演变成那样，但是我们能冒这个险吗？为了虚无飘渺的未来，我们能拿现在当赌注吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"We must--because the future isn't nebulous. It's been calculated out bySeldon and charted. Each successive crisis in our history is mapped andeach depends in a measure on the successful conclusion of the onesprevious. This is only the second crisis and Space knows what effect even atrifling deviation would have in the end."</p>
<p>“我们必须这么做——因为未来并非虚无飘渺。谢顿已经计算并描述得很清楚。他已经预先设定未来将连续不断发生的危机；每一次危机，多少都取决于上一个危机的圆满解决。目前的危机只是第二个，天晓得倘若稍有偏差，最后会造成什么结果。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That's rather empty speculation."</p>
<p>“这算是空洞的臆测。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No! Hari Seldon said in the Time Vault, that at each crisis our freedom ofaction would become circumscribed to the point where only one course ofaction was possible."</p>
<p>“不！是哈里·谢顿在时光穹窿中这么说的。每次遇到危机时，我们的行动自由便会受限，只剩下唯一的一条路可走。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"So as to keep us on the straight and narrow?"</p>
<p>“为了使我们维持在这条窄路上？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"So as to keep us from deviating, yes. But, conversely, as long as morethan one course of action is possible, the crisis has not been reached. Wemust let things drift so long as we possibly can, and by space, that's whatI intend doing."</p>
<p>“或者说，为了避免我们走到岔路上。反之，假如行动方案不止一个，就表示危机尚未来临。我们必须尽可能让事情自然发展，太空在上，这正是我打算要做的事。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Verisof didn't answer. He chewed his lower lip in a grudging silence. Ithad only been the year before that Hardin had first discussed the problemwith him--the real problem; the problem of countering Anacreon's hostilepreparations. And then only because he, Verisof, had balked at furtherappeasement.</p>
<p>维瑞索夫并没有回答。他只是咬着下唇，不情愿地沉默不语。去年，哈定才头一次跟他讨论这个问题——这个实际的问题：如何化解安纳克里昂进攻基地的意图。因为那个时候，连维瑞索夫也开始主张停止姑息政策。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin seemed to follow his ambassador's thoughts. "I would much rathernever to have told you anything about this."</p>
<p>哈定似乎能猜到这位大使的想法。“我倒宁愿从来没有告诉过你这些事。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"What makes you say that?" cried Verisof, in surprise.</p>
<p>“你为何这么说？”维瑞索夫吃惊地吼道。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Because there are six people now--you and I, the other three ambassadorsand Yohan Lee-- who have a fair notion of what's ahead; and I'm damnedafraid that it was Seldon's idea to have no one know."</p>
<p>“因为现在总共有六个人——你、我、另外三位大使以及约翰·李——对于将要发生的事有了相当的概念，我真担心谢顿其实希望瞒着每个人。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Why so?"</p>
<p>“为什么？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Because even Seldon's advanced psychology was limited. It could not handletoo many independent variables. He couldn't work with individuals over anylength of time; any more than you could apply kinetic theory of gases tosingle molecules. He worked with mobs, populations of whole planets, andonly blind mobs who do not possess foreknowledge of the results of theirown actions."</p>
<p>“因为谢顿的心理学虽然先进，却有先天的限制。它不能处理太多的独立变量。它也无法用在个人身上，不论想要预测的时间是长是短，就像‘气体运动论’不适用于个别分子一样。谢顿的研究对象是群众，是整个行星上的居民。这些群众还必须不知情；对于行动将产生什么结果，他们完全没有任何预知。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That's not plain."</p>
<p>“我听不太懂。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I can't help it. I'm not psychologist enough to explain it scientifically. But this you know. There are no trained psychologists on Terminus and nomathematical texts on the science. It is plain that he wanted no one onTerminus capable of working out the future in advance. Seldon wanted us toproceed blindly--and therefore correctly-- according to the law of mobpsychology. As I once told you, I never knew where we were heading when Ifirst drove out the Anacreonians. My idea had been to maintain balance of power, no more than that. It was only afterward that I thought I saw apattern in events; but I've done my level best not to act on that knowledge. Interference due to foresight would have knocked the Plan out of kilter."</p>
<p>“我也没办法。我并不是真正的心理学家，不能用科学的语言来详细说明。可是你也知道，端点星上没有训练有素的心理学家，也没有这方面的数学参考书。显然，谢顿不要让端点星上的人具有任何预测未来的能力。他希望我们盲目发展——因而也就能正确地根据群众心理学的原则来发展。正如我曾经告诉过你的，当初我赶走安纳克里昂人的时候，根本不知道我们应该何去何从。当时我的想法只是保持势力均衡，如此而已。直到后来我才发觉，各个事件之间有个微妙的模式；但是我采取行动时，尽量不考虑这一点。因为一旦被先见之明所干扰，整个计划就会被破坏了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Verisof nodded thoughtfully. "I've heard arguments almost as complicated inthe Temples back on Anacreon. How do you expect to spot the fight moment ofaction?"</p>
<p>维瑞索夫若有所悟地点点头。“我在安纳克里昂的灵殿中，也曾听过同样复杂的理论。然而，你要如何判断正确的行动时机？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It's spotted already. You admit that once we repair the battle cruisernothing will stop Wienis from attacking us. There will no longer be anyalternative in that respect."</p>
<p>“时机早已决定了。你也承认，一旦我们修复了巡弋舰，温尼斯势必会对我们发动攻击。这件事绝无任何回旋余地。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes"All right. That accounts for the external aspect. Meanwhile, you'llfurther admit that the next election will see a new and hostile Councilthat will force action against Anacreon. There is no alternative there."</p>
<p>“好，所以外在因素已经确定了。另一方面你也承认，下次选举后，会产生一个由反对党主控的新议会，它会迫使我们对安纳克里昂采取行动。这也没有任何回旋余地。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>“没错。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And as soon as all the alternatives disappear, the crisis has come. Just the same--I get worried.</p>
<p>“当所有余地都消失时，危机就来临了。话说回来，我有点担心。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He paused, and Verisof waited. Slowly, almost reluctantly, Hardincontinued, "I've got the idea--just a notion--that the external andinternal pressures were planned to come to a head simultaneously. As it is,there's a few months difference. Wienis will probably attack before spring,and elections are still a year off."</p>
<p>哈定停了下来，维瑞索夫耐心地等着。哈定却慢慢吞吞、几乎很勉强地继续说：“我有一个想法——只能算是个人见解——根据谢顿的计划，内外的压力应该在同时升到顶点。如今看来，却有几个月的出入。温尼斯可能在春天之前就打过来，而距离选举却还有一年的时间。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That doesn't sound important."</p>
<p>“这好像并不重要。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I don't know. It may be due merely to unavoidable errors of calculation,or it might be due to the fact that I knew too much. I tried never to letmy foresight influence my action, but how can I tell? And what effect willthe discrepancy have? Anyway," he looked up, "there's one thing I'vedecided."</p>
<p>“我不知道。也许只是不可避免的计算误差，或者由于我知道得太多使然。我尽量避免让自己的预感左右自己的行动，但我又如何确定呢？那一点点时间上的差异，会带来什么样的影响？无论如何，”他抬起头来，“至少有一件事我已经决定了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And what's that?"</p>
<p>“什么事？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"When the crisis does begin to break, I'm going to Anacreon. I want to beon the spot ... Oh, that's enough, Verisof. It's getting late. Let's go outand make a night of it. I want some relaxation."</p>
<p>“当危机爆发时，我要到安纳克里昂去。我要亲自到现场去……喔，维瑞索夫，我们谈得够多了。时候不早了，我们出去喝杯酒，我想轻松轻松。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Then get it right here,' said Verisof. "I don't want to be recognized, oryou know what this new party your precious Councilmen are forming wouldsay. Call for the brandy."</p>
<p>“那就在这里喝吧，”维瑞索夫说，“我可不想被认出来。否则你也知道，那些伟大的议员新组的政党会怎么说。叫人送些白兰地来吧。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And Hardin did--but not for too much.</p>
<p>哈定接受了他的建议——但没有叫得太多。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p></p>
<p>市长(3)</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>In the ancient days when the Galactic Empire had embraced the Galaxy, andAnacreon had been the richest of the prefects of the Periphery, more thanone emperor had visited the Viceregal Palace in state. And not one had leftwithout at least one effort to pit his skill with air speedster and needlegun against the feathered flying fortress they call the Nyakbird.</p>
<p>古时候，当银河帝国统治着整个银河系，而安纳克里昂是银河外缘最富裕的星郡时，曾有不少皇帝正式访问过安纳克里昂的总督官邸。而且，每一位莅临的皇帝都曾经一试身手，也就是驾着高速空中飞车，用针枪猎杀如同空中堡垒般的巨鸟。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The fame of Anacreon had withered to nothing with the decay of the times. The Viceregal Palace was a drafty mass of ruins except for the wing thatFoundation workmen had restored. And no Emperor had been seen in Anacreonfor two hundred years.</p>
<p>如今，安纳克里昂的声望已随着光荣时代一起走入历史。现在那座总督官邸，除了由基地工人修复的一侧之外，其余全是一片断垣残壁的废墟。而最近两百年间，也从来没有皇帝驾临此地了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>But Nyak hunting was still the royal sport and a good eye with the needlegun still the first requirement of Anacreon's kings.</p>
<p>不过，猎杀巨鸟仍是此间王室钟爱的狩猎活动，而身为安纳克里昂国王的首要条件，就是要善用猎射巨鸟的针枪。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lepold I, King of Anacreon and--as was invariably, but untruthfully added?Lord of the Outer Dominions, though not yet sixteen had already provedhis skill many times over. He had brought down his first Nyak when scarcelythirteen; had brought down his tenth the week after his accession to thethrone; and was returning now from his forty-sixth.</p>
<p>列普德一世是当今的安纳克里昂国王，并且照例冠上“银河外围之主”这个名不副实的封号。虽然他还不满十六岁，已经是猎杀巨鸟的高手。他在不到十三岁时就首开纪录，即位刚满一周，就打下生平第十只巨鸟。今天他猎杀到第四十六只，正高高兴兴踏上归途。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Fifty before I come of age," he had exulted. "Who'll take the wager?"</p>
<p>“在我成年之前，要射下五十只。”他欢欣鼓舞地说，“谁敢跟我打赌？”</p></div>

<p>But Courtiers don't take wagers against the king's skill. There is thedeadly danger of winning. So no one did, and the king left to change his clothes in high spirits.</p>
<p>朝臣们都不敢跟国王打赌，因为赢了反倒有杀身之祸，所以没有人敢做声。于是国王得意洋洋地准备回房换衣服。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Lepold!"</p>
<p>“列普德！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The king stopped mid-step at the one voice that could cause him to do so. He turned sulkily.</p>
<p>听到这声强有力的叫唤，国王停下迈出一半的脚步，闷闷不乐地转过头来。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis stood upon the threshold of his chambers and beetled at his young nephew.</p>
<p>温尼斯站在自己的书房门口，以严厉的目光瞪着年轻的侄子。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Send them away," he motioned impatiently. "Get rid of them."</p>
<p>“让他们退下，”温尼斯做着不耐烦的手势，“快让他们退下。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The king nodded curtly and the two chamberlains bowed and backed down thestairs. Lepold entered his uncle's room.</p>
<p>国王生硬地点点头，两名侍从便赶紧鞠躬并退到楼下去。列普德自己则走进叔父的书房。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis stared at the king's hunting suit morosely. "You'll have moreimportant things to tend to than Nyak hunting soon enough."</p>
<p>温尼斯忧心忡忡地瞪着国王的猎装。“要不了多久，你就得把心思放在比猎鸟更要紧的事情上。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He turned his back and stumped to his desk. Since he had grown too old forthe rush of air, the perilous dive within wing-beat of the Nyak, the rolland climb of the speedster at the motion of a foot, he had soured upon thewhole sport.</p>
<p>他转身蹒跚地走向书桌。温尼斯自从上了年纪，受不了气流的冲击，也无法冒险俯冲到巨鸟的翼下，更不能以单脚操纵空中飞车翻滚爬升，他就对这项运动产生了反感。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lepold appreciated his uncle's sour-grapes attitude and it was not withoutmalice that he began enthusiastically, "But you should have been with ustoday, uncle. We flushed one in the wilds of Sarnia that was a monster. Andgame as they come. We had it out for two hours over at least seventy squaremiles of ground. And then I got to Sunwards--"</p>
<p>列普德深知叔父的酸葡萄心理，却不怀好意，故意兴冲冲地说：“叔叔，你今天真该跟我一起去。我们在沙米亚草原赶起一只巨鸟，简直大得像个妖怪，于是游戏便开始了。我们追赶了它两个小时，至少横跨七十平方英里。然后，我到了向阳高原。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>he was motioning graphically,as though he were once more in his speedster--and dived torque-wise. Caught him on the rise just under the left wing at quarters. It maddenedhim and he canted athwart. I took his dare and veered a-left, waiting forthe plummet. Sure enough, down he came. He was within wing-beat before Imoved and then--</p>
<p>国王一面说，一面比手划脚，好像他还在高速空中飞车上。“我开始盘旋俯冲。趁它往上飞的时候，我射击它的左翼下方。结果将它激怒了，打横翻滚出去。我勇敢迎战，向左急转，等着它笔直落下。果然不出我所料，它真的下来了。可是我还来不及行动，它已经冲到翅膀打得到我……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Lepold!" </p>
<p>“列普德！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well!?I got him." </p>
<p>“喔——我就射中它了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I'm sure you did. Now will you attend?"</p>
<p>“我不怀疑这一点，现在你注意听我说好吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The king shrugged and gravitated to the end table where he nibbled at aLera nut in quite an unregal sulk. He did not dare to meet his uncle'seyes.</p>
<p>国王耸耸肩，随即被桌上的食物吸引，拿起一颗莉菈坚果咬了几口。他露出国王不该有的愠怒，也不敢正视叔父的眼睛。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis said, by way of preamble, "I've been to the ship today." </p>
<p>温尼斯先说了一句开场白：“我今天上了那艘星舰。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"What ship?" </p>
<p>“什么星舰？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"There is only one ship. The ship. The one the Foundation is repairing forthe navy. The old Imperial cruiser. Do I make myself sufficiently plain?" </p>
<p>“星舰只有一艘，只有那一艘！就是基地正在替我们舰队修复的那艘，它是当年帝国的巡弋舰。我这样说够清楚了吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That one? You see, I told you the Foundation would repair it if we askedthem to. It's all poppycock, you know, that story of yours about theirwanting to attack us. Because if they did, why would they fix the ship? Itdoesn't make sense, you know." </p>
<p>“就是那艘吗？你瞧，我早就告诉你，只要我们叫基地帮忙修理，他们绝不敢抗命。你说什么他们想攻击我们，你瞧，那只是你神经过敏。假使他们有那个意思，又怎么会替我们修理星舰呢？你瞧，这根本说不通。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Lepold, you're a fool!"</p>
<p>“列普德，你是个笨蛋！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The king, who had just discarded the shell of the Lera nut and was liftinganother to his lips, flushed.</p>
<p>国王刚把坚果壳扔掉，正拿起另一颗准备塞进嘴里，听了这句话，他满脸涨得通红。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well now, look here," he said, with anger that scarcely rose abovepeevishness, "I don't think you ought to call me that. You forget yourself. I'll be of age in two months, you know." </p>
<p>“好啊，请你注意，”国王的声音虽然不悦，但是仍然跟撒娇差不多，“我想你不应该那样骂我，你忘了自己是什么身份。你瞧，我再过两个月就成年了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, and you're in a fine position to assume regal responsibilities. Ifyou spent half the time on public affairs that you do on Nyak hunting, I'dresign the regency directly with a clear conscience." </p>
<p>“对，你就要当一国之主，承担起国王的重责大任。假如你把打鸟的时间分一半来处理公务，我马上心安理得地辞去摄政的职位。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I don't care. That has nothing to do with the case, you know. The fact isthat even if you are the regent and my uncle, I'm still king and you'restill my subject. You oughtn't to call me a fool and you oughtn't to sit inmy presence, anyway. You haven't asked my permission. I think you ought tobe careful, or I might do something about it pretty soon."</p>
<p>“我不在乎。你瞧，这根本是毫不相干的两码事。事实是，即使你是摄政王，又是我的叔叔，但我仍是国王，而你仍是我的臣民。无论如何，你不应该骂我笨蛋，也不应该在我面前坐下；你还没有请求我的恩准。我认为你该小心点，否则我会有所反应——很快就会。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis' gaze was cold. "May I refer to you as 'your majesty'?" </p>
<p>温尼斯以冷峻的目光望着国王。“我应该尊称你‘陛下’吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes." </p>
<p>“是的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Very well! You are a fool, your majesty!"</p>
<p>“很好！陛下，你是个笨蛋！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>His dark eyes blazed from beneath his grizzled brows and the young king satdown slowly. </p>
<p>在斑白的眉毛下，温尼斯的黑眼珠冒出怒火，吓得年轻的国王慢慢坐下来。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>For a moment, there was sardonic satisfaction in the regent'sface, but it faded quickly. His thick lips parted in a smile and one handfell upon the king's shoulder.</p>
<p>一时之间，温尼斯脸上浮现出得意的嘲讽神色，但只是一闪而过。他很快咧开厚厚的嘴唇笑了笑，并伸出一只手搭着国王的肩膀。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Never mind, Lepold. I should not have spoken harshly to you. It isdifficult sometimes to behave with true propriety when the pressure ofevents is such as--You understand?" But if the words were conciliatory,there was something in his eyes that had not softened. </p>
<p>“列普德，别介意。我不该对你那么凶。但是压力那么大的时候，有时很难让言行合乎礼数——你懂吗？”他的语气虽然温和，目光却没有软化。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lepold said uncertainly, "Yes. Affairs of State are deuced difficult, youknow." He wondered, not without apprehension, whether he were not in for adull siege of meaningless details on the year's trade with Smyrno and thelong, wrangling dispute over the sparsely settled worlds on the RedCorridor. </p>
<p>列普德犹豫不决地说：“是啊。你瞧，国家大事相当艰难。”他开始有点担心，会不会又得听叔父提起无聊的对司密尔诺本年贸易细节，或是红廊区各零星世界间的长期纠纷等等问题。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis was speaking again. "My boy, I had thought to speak of this to youearlier, and perhaps I should have, but I know that your youthful spiritsare impatient of the dry detail of statecraft."</p>
<p>温尼斯继续说：“孩子，我早就想跟你谈这件事，也许我早该跟你谈谈。但是我知道你太年轻，不耐烦听这些繁琐的政务。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lepold nodded. "Well, that's all right? </p>
<p>列普德点点头。“嗯，没关系……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>His uncle broke in firmly and continued, "However, you will come of age in two months. Moreover, in the difficult times that are coming, you will haveto take a full and active part. You will be king henceforward, Lepold."</p>
<p>这位叔父断然地抢着说：“然而，再过两个月你就成年了。更重要的是，面对将来的挑战，你必须扮演一个积极主动的角色。列普德，你即将成为一位真正的国王了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Again Lepold nodded, but his expression was quite blank. </p>
<p>列普德又点点头，表情却相当茫然。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>There will be war, Lepold. </p>
<p>“列普德，战争很快就要来临。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"War! But there's been truce with Smyrno?</p>
<p>“战争！但我们已经和司密尔诺休战……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Not Smyrno. The Foundation itself." </p>
<p>“不是司密尔诺，而是跟基地作战。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"But, uncle, they've agreed to repair the ship. You said?</p>
<p>“但是，叔叔，他们已经同意为我们修理星舰。你说……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>His voice choked off at the twist of his uncle's lip.</p>
<p>看见叔父的嘴唇一撇，他赶紧把下面的话硬生生咽回去。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Lepold"-- some of the friendliness had gone--we are to talk man to man. There is to be war with the Foundation, whether the ship is repaired ornot; all the sooner, in fact, since it is being repaired. The Foundation isthe source of power and might. All the greatness of Anacreon; all its shipsand its cities and its people and its commerce depend on the dribbles andleavings of power that the Foundation have given us grudgingly. I rememberthe time-- I, myself--when the cities of Anacreon were warmed by theburning of coal and oil. But never mind that; you would have no conceptionof it." </p>
<p>“列普德，”温尼斯的语气不再那么友善，“我把你当大人在跟你讨论问题。不管基地愿不愿意修理星舰，我们都要和他们作战；事实上，既然修理正在进行，战争反而爆发得更快。基地是一切有形和无形力量的根源。安纳克里昂的一切伟大成就，包括船舰、城市、百姓、贸易等等，样样都仰赖基地的鼻息，而基地施舍给我们的，只不过是它的九牛一毛，一些不要的残渣剩菜。我自己还记得当年，安纳克里昂的城市都只能靠油和煤来取暖。但不提这些了，你不会有任何概念的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It seems," suggested the king timidly, "that we ought to be grateful?</p>
<p>“我们似乎，”国王战战兢兢地说，“应该感激……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Grateful?" roared Wienis. "Grateful that they begrudge us the merestdregs, while keeping space knows what for themselves--and keeping it withwhat purpose in mind? Why, only that they may some day rule the Galaxy."</p>
<p>“感激？”温尼斯吼道，“他们只肯施舍一点渣滓给我们，天晓得他们自己藏了多少宝贝——他们藏起来是在打什么主意？哈，他们想要有朝一日统治整个银河。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>His hand came down on his nephew's knee, and his eyes narrowed. "Lepold,you are king of Anacreon. Your children and your children's children may bekings of the universe--if you have the power that the Foundation iskeeping from us!" </p>
<p>他将手移到侄子的膝盖上，眯起了眼睛。“列普德，你是安纳克里昂的国王。你的儿子或儿子的儿子，有可能成为宇宙之王——只要你能得到基地隐藏起来的力量！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"There's something in that." Lepold's eyes gained a sparkle and his backstraightened. "After all, what right have they to keep it to themselves? Not fair, you know. Anacreon counts for something, too." </p>
<p>“你说得有些道理。”列普德的眼睛亮了起来，脊背也挺直了，“毕竟，他们有什么权利独占呢？你瞧，这不公平。安纳克里昂也该有一份。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You see, you're beginning to understand. And now, my boy, what if Smyrnodecides to attack the Foundation for its own part and thus gains all thatpower? How long do you suppose we could escape becoming a vassal power? Howlong would you hold your throne?"</p>
<p>“看，你开始了解了。那么，孩子，万一司密尔诺决定抢先攻占基地，夺取所有的力量，那该怎么办？我们逃得过成为藩属的命运吗？你自己还能当多久的国王呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lepold grew excited. "Space, yes. You're absolutely right, you know. Wemust strike first. It's simply self-defense."</p>
<p>列普德变得激动起来。“太空啊，有道理。你瞧，你说得完全正确。我们必须先发制人，这只是自卫罢了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis' smile broadened slightly. "Furthermore, once, at the very beginningof the reign of your grandfather, Anacreon actually established a militarybase on the Foundation's planet, Terminus--a base vitally needed fornational defense. We were forced to abandon that base as a result of themachinations of the leader of that Foundation, a sly cur, a scholar, withnot a drop of noble blood in his veins. You understand, Lepold? Yourgrandfather was humiliated by this commoner. I remember him! He wasscarcely older than myself when he came to Anacreon with his devil's smileand devil's brain--and the power of the other three kingdoms behind him,combined in cowardly union against the greatness of Anacreon."</p>
<p>温尼斯的笑容扩大了一点。“此外，在你的祖父称王之初，安纳克里昂的确曾在基地所在的端点星上，建立过一个军事基地——它对我们的国防极为重要。但是，由于基地领导者的阴谋诡计，逼得我们被迫撤离。那人是个狡滑的无赖，只是一名学者，全身上下没有一滴贵族血液。列普德，你懂吗？你的祖父被那个平民羞辱过。我还记得他！他差不多跟我同年，当年他带着恶魔似的微笑和恶魔似的头脑来到安纳克里昂——拿着另外三个王国当后盾，他们组成了反抗安纳克里昂伟业的懦夫联盟。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lepold flushed and the sparkle in his eyes blazed. "By Seldon, if I hadbeen my grandfather, I would have fought even so."  </p>
<p>列普德满脸通红，眼睛也更亮了。“我向谢顿发誓，假使我是祖父，无论如何我都决心一战。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>No, Lepold. We decided to wait--to wipe out the insult at a fitter time. It had been your father's hope, before his untimely death, that he might bethe one to-- Well, well! Wienis turned away for a moment. Then, as ifstifling emotion, "He was my brother. And yet, if his son were?</p>
<p>“不，列普德。我们当时决定等待——等待更恰当的时机再雪耻。在你父亲没有猝然辞世之前，他曾经希望自己就是……唉！唉！”温尼斯把脸转开一会儿，再用似乎很伤痛的口吻说：“他是我的兄长，假如他的孩子……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, uncle, I'll not fail him. I have decided. It seems only proper thatAnacreon wipe out this nest of troublemakers, and that immediately." </p>
<p>“对，叔叔，我不会辜负他。我已经下定决心，安纳克里昂一定要扫荡那个制造麻烦的祸源，而且要马上。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No, not immediately. First, we must wait for the repairs of the battlecruiser to be completed. The mere fact that they are willing to undertakethese repairs proves that they fear us. The fools attempt to placate us,but we are not to be turned from our path, are we?"</p>
<p>“不，不能马上。首先，我们必须等巡弋舰修好。他们接下修理的工作，唯一的原因是害怕我们。那些傻瓜想讨好我们，但我们并不会改变心意，对不对？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And Lepold's fist slammed against his cupped palm. "Not while I am king in Anacreon."</p>
<p>列普德一手握拳，猛捶另一只手的掌心。“只要我还是安纳克里昂王，绝对不会。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis' lip twitched sardonically. "Besides which we must wait for Salvor Hardin to arrive." </p>
<p>温尼斯的嘴唇扯出一个嘲讽的神情。“此外，我们必须等塞佛·哈定来到这里。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Salvor Hardin!" The king grew suddenly round-eyed, and the youthful contour of his beardless face lost the almost hard lines into which theyhad been compressed.</p>
<p>“塞佛·哈定！”国王突然睁大眼睛，光洁稚嫩的脸上原本堆满的凶悍线条消失无踪。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, Lepold, the leader of the Foundation himself is coming to Anacreon onyour birthday--probably to soothe us with buttered words. But it won'thelp him." </p>
<p>“对，列普德，基地的领导人要亲自到安纳克里昂来祝贺你的生日——或许是想来巴结我们。但是他这样做毫无用处。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Salvor Hardin!" It was the merest murmur.</p>
<p>“塞佛·哈定！”国王只是喃喃低语。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis frowned. "Are you afraid of the name? It is the same Salvor Hardin,who on his previous visit, ground our noses into the dust. You're notforgetting that deadly insult to the royal house? And from a commoner. The dregs of the gutter." </p>
<p>温尼斯皱起眉头。“你怕这个名字吗？就是这个塞佛·哈定，他上次来的时候，简直就是踩在我们头上。王室曾经遭到这种奇耻大辱，你不会忘记吧？而且他只是一个平民，是贫民窟里的垃圾。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No. I guess not. No, I won't. I won't! We'll pay him back--but...but--I'm afraid--a little."</p>
<p>“我想我不会忘记，不会忘记的，绝对不会忘记！我们要以牙还牙……但是……但是……我有点……有点害怕……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The regent rose. "Afraid? Of what? Of what, you young? He choked off.</p>
<p>摄政王站了起来。“害怕？怕什么，你怕什么？你这个小王……”他及时把下面的话吞回去。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It would be...uh...sort of blasphemous, you know, to attack theFoundation. I mean? He paused.</p>
<p>“那会是……呃……一种亵渎，你瞧，竟然去攻击基地。我的意思是……”他停了下来。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Go on."</p>
<p>“说下去。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lepold said confusedly, "I mean, if there were really a Galactic Spirit,he...uh...it mightn't like it. Don't you think? </p>
<p>列普德以困惑的口吻说：“我的意思是，假如真有‘银河圣灵’，它……呃……它可能会不高兴的。你不觉得吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No, I don't," was the hard answer. Wienis sat down again and his lipstwisted in a queer smile. "And so youreally bother your head a great deal over the Galactic Spirit, do you? That's what comes of letting you run wild. You've been listening to Verisofquite a bit, I take it." </p>
<p>“不，我可不那么想。”温尼斯答得非常冷酷。说完他再度坐下，嘴唇扭曲成一个诡异的笑容。“你的脑袋真的为银河圣灵这么担心吗？所以你才会这么胡思乱想，优柔寡断。我认为，你是听多了维瑞索夫的鬼话。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"He's explained a great deal……"</p>
<p>“他对我解释了很多……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"About the Galactic Spirit?" </p>
<p>“有关银河圣灵的事吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes." </p>
<p>“是啊。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Why, you unweaned cub, he believes in that mummery a good deal less than Ido, and I don't believe in it at all. How many times have you been toldthat all this talk is nonsense?" </p>
<p>“哎呀，你这个乳臭未干的娃儿。他对于自己所说的那一套惑众妖言，比我更不相信千百倍，而我呢，则是一点也不相信。那些都是无稽之谈，我告诉过你多少次了？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well, I know that. But Verisof says……"</p>
<p>“嗯，我知道。但是维瑞索夫说……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Pay no heed to Verisof. It's nonsense."</p>
<p>“别听维瑞索夫的，那都是胡说八道。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>There was a short, rebellious silence, and then Lepold said, "Everyonebelieves it just the same. I mean all this talk about the Prophet HariSeldon and how he appointed the Foundation to carry on his commandmentsthat there might some day be a return of the Galactic Paradise: and howanyone who disobeys his commandments will be destroyed for eternity. Theybelieve it. I've presided at festivals, and I'm sure they do." </p>
<p>接着是短短一段抗议性的沉默，然后列普德才说：“反正大家都相信。我是说关于先知哈里·谢顿，以及他如何指定基地完成他的圣训——在未来的某一天，‘银河乐园’将重返人间；不服从圣训的人将永远形神俱灭。老百姓都相信这个说法，我主持过庆典，所以我知道他们都相信。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, they do; but we don't. And you may be thankful it's so, for accordingto this foolishness, you are king by divine right--and are semi-divineyourself. Very handy. It eliminates all possibilities of revolts andinsures absolute obedience in everything. And that is why, Lepold, you musttake an active part in ordering the war against the Foundation. I am onlyregent, and quite human. You are king, and more than half a god--to them." </p>
<p>“没错，他们相信，但是我们不相信。其实你应当感激这件事实，由于这套愚民政策，你才能根据神的旨意当上国王——让你自己变成半人半神。这简直轻而易举。这套说法也消除了所有叛变的可能，保证老百姓绝对服从每一件事。所以说，列普德，你必须主动对基地宣战。我只是摄政王，是个凡人。而你是国王，对老百姓而言，是半个神。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"But I suppose I'm not really," said the king reflectively.</p>
<p>“但我自己觉得不是。”国王深思熟虑地说。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No, not really," came the sardonic response, "but you are to everyone butthe people of the Foundation. Get that? To everyone but those of theFoundation. Once they are removed there will be no one to deny you thegodhead. Think of that!" </p>
<p>“对，其实不是。”温尼斯以挖苦的语气答道，“但在别人眼中你就是，只有基地的人例外。懂了吗？基地以外的人都认为你是半个神。假如把他们除去，就再也没有人否认你的神性。你想想清楚！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And after that we will ourselves be able to operate the power boxes of thetemples and the ships that fly without men and the holy food that curescancer and all the rest? Verisof said only those blessed with the Galactic Spirit could?</p>
<p>“到那个时候，我们就能自己控制灵殿的发电机、无人太空船、治癌的圣粮和其他一切？维瑞索夫说，只有银河圣灵祝福过的人才能……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes, Verisof said! Verisof, next to Salvor Hardin, is your greatest enemy. Stay with me, Lepold, and don't worry about them. Together we will recreatean empire-not just the kingdom of Anacreon-but one comprising every one ofthe billions of suns of the Empire. Is that better than a wordy 'GalacticParadise'?" </p>
<p>“对，维瑞索夫那么说！除了哈定，维瑞索夫就是你最大的敌人。列普德，你和我站在一起，不用担心他们。让我们叔侄联手，共同重建一个帝国——不只是安纳克里昂王国，而是包括整个银河系上千亿颗恒星的帝国。这样总比口头上的‘银河乐园’更好吧？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Ye-es." </p>
<p>“是……是的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Can Verisof promise more?" </p>
<p>“维瑞索夫能保证更多吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No." </p>
<p>“不能。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Very well." His voice became peremptory. "I suppose we may consider thematter settled." He waited for no answer. "Get along. I'll be down later.</p>
<p>“好极了。”温尼斯的语气变得更加蛮横，“我想，这个问题可以算解决了。”他不等国王回答，又说：“你走吧，我等会儿再下去。列普德，还有一件事。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And just one thing, Lepold."The young king turned on the threshold.</p>
<p>年轻的国王刚走到门槛，又回过头来。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis was smiling with all but his eyes. "Be careful on these Nyak hunts,my boy. Since the unfortunate accident to your father, I have had thestrangest presentiments concerning you, at times. In the confusion, withneedle guns thickening the air with darts, one can never tell. You will becareful, I hope. And you'll do as I say about the Foundation, won't you?"Lepold's eyes widened and dropped away from those of his uncle. "Yes--</p>
<p>温尼斯面露微笑，眼里却没有一丝笑意。“孩子，你打巨鸟的时候要小心。自从你父亲不幸意外身亡，有些时候，我对你的安危有很奇怪的预感。针枪射出的针弹在空中乱飞时，混乱之中，谁也说不准会发生什么事。我希望你要多加小心。有关基地的问题，你会照我说的去做，对吧？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>certainly." </p>
<p>列普德睁大眼睛，却避开叔父的视线。“对……当然。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Good!" He stared after his departing nephew, expressionlessly, andreturned to his desk.</p>
<p>“很好！”他面无表情地瞪着侄子的背影，然后走回自己的书桌。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And Lepold's thoughts as he left were somber and not unfearful. Perhaps itwould be best to defeat the Foundation and gain the power Wienis spoke of. But afterward, when the war was over and he was secure on his throne?Hebecame acutely conscious of the fact that Wienis and his two arrogant sonswere at present next in line to the throne.</p>
<p>而列普德离开时，内心却充满忧虑与恐惧。攻击基地、取得温尼斯所说的力量，或许的确是最好的策略。但是他又有一种强烈的感觉——当战争结束，自己的王权巩固之后，温尼斯与他那两个高傲的儿子就会等着继承王位。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>But he was king. And kings could order people executed.</p>
<p>但他是国王，国王能下令处死任何子民。</p></div>

<p>Next to Sermak himself, Lewis Bort was the most active in rallying thosedissident elements which had fused into the now-vociferous Action Party. Yet he had not been one of the deputation that had called on Salvor Hardinalmost half a year previously. That this was so was not due to any lack ofrecognition of his efforts; quite the contrary. He was absent for the verygood reason that he was on Anacreon's capital world at the time.</p>
<p>除了瑟麦克本人，路易斯·玻特是反对阵营中最活跃的一员。他一直积极地召集异议分子，进而促成如今声势浩大的“行动党”。但他并未参加大约半年前去拜见塞佛·哈定的代表团。这并不表示他的努力未被认可，事实上正好相反。他不能参加是因为另有重要任务，当时他正在安纳克里昂的首都世界。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He visited it as a private citizen. He saw no official and he did nothingof importance. He merely watched the obscure comers of the busy planet andpoked his stubby nose into dusty crannies.</p>
<p>那次他是以私人身份去的。他没有拜会任何达官贵人，也没有其他什么大动作。他只是去观察那个忙碌世界的各个幽暗角落，并且透过各种管道刺探情报。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He arrived home toward the end of a short winter day that had started withclouds and was finishing with snow and within an hour was seated at theoctagonal table in Sermak's home.</p>
<p>他回到端点星时已是冬季，那个短暂的白昼始于乌云而终于瑞雪。玻特是在傍晚抵达的，不到一小时后，他已经坐在瑟麦克家中的八角桌旁。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>His first words were not calculated to improve the atmosphere of agathering already considerably depressed by the deepening snow-filledtwilight outside..</p>
<p>薄暮中厚厚的积雪，像压在所有人的心头，令气氛相当凝重。玻特却没有委婉的开场白，一开口就开门见山。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I'm afraid," he said, "that our position is what is usually termed, inmelodramatic phraseology, a 'Lost Cause.'"</p>
<p>“恐怕，”他说，“我们目前的处境，套用夸张的说法，就是‘徒劳一场空’。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You think so?" said Sermak, gloomily.</p>
<p>“你真的这么想吗？”瑟麦克沮丧地问。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It's gone past thought, Sermak. There's no room for any other opinion."</p>
<p>“瑟麦克，这还用说吗，没有别的可能了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Armaments? began Dokor Walto, somewhat officiously, but Bort broke in atonce.</p>
<p>“关于军备……”托卡·渥图有些急切地说，却马上被玻特阻止。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Forget that. That's an old story." His eyes traveled round the circle. "I'm referring to the people. I admit that it was my idea originally thatwe attempt to foster a palace rebellion of some sort to install as kingsomeone more favorable to the Foundation. It was a good idea. It still is. The only trifling flaw about it is that it is impossible. The great SalvorHardin saw to that."</p>
<p>“忘了它吧。这是个司空见惯的老把戏，”玻特环顾四周每一个人，“我指的是如何控制安纳克里昂的人民。我承认最初是我提出那个构想，由我们来资助一场宫廷革命，扶植一个亲基地的人为王。这是很好的想法，至今仍是如此。它唯一的缺点就是无法实现，伟大的塞佛·哈定早就防到了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak said sourly, "If you'd give us the details, Bort?</p>
<p>瑟麦克不悦地说：“玻特，你能不能告诉我们详情？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Details! There aren't any! It isn't as simple as that. It's the wholedamned situation on Anacreon. It's this religion the Foundation hasestablished. It works!"</p>
<p>“详情！没有详情！事情可没那么单纯。安纳克里昂的整个情势，都他妈的牵扯在内。都是因为基地在那里所设立的宗教，它还真有效！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well!"</p>
<p>“喔！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You've got to see it work to appreciate it. All you see here is that wehave a large school devoted to the training of priests, and thatoccasionally a special show is put on in some obscure comer of the city forthe benefit of pilgrims and that's all. The whole business hardly affectsus as a general thing. But on Anacreon?</p>
<p>“必须亲眼见到，你才会相信效果有多好。你在这里能看到的，只有我们为了训练教士所设立的大型学校，或是为了让朝圣者开开眼界，而在市内不起眼的角落偶尔举办的特别表演——如此而已。整件事对我们几乎没有什么影响，但是在安纳克里昂……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lem Tarki smoothed his prim little Vandyke with one finger, and cleared histhroat. "What kind of religion is it? Hardin's always said that it was justa fluffy flummery to get them to accept our science without question. Youremember, Sermak, he told us that day?</p>
<p>兰姆·塔基用一根指头摸摸自己古怪的短髯，又清了清喉咙。“那是什么样的宗教？哈定不断强调，说那是为了使他们全盘接受我们的科学，而随便弄出来唬人的幌子。瑟麦克，你还记得吧，当天他告诉我们……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Hardin's explanations," reminded Sermak, "don't often mean much at facevalue. But what kind of a religion is it, Bort?"</p>
<p>“哈定的解释，”瑟麦克提醒众人，“表面的意义通常并不大。玻特，但那到底是什么样的宗教呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Bort considered. "Ethically, it's fine. It scarcely varies from the variousphilosophies of the old Empire. High moral standards and all that. There'snothing to complain about from that viewpoint. Religion is one of the greatcivilizing influences of history and in that respect, it's fulfilling?</p>
<p>玻特想了一想。“就伦理学而言，并没有什么问题。和帝国时代的各种哲学没有太大不同，不外是崇高的道德标准之类的。从那个角度来看，没有什么值得批评的。历史上，宗教一直有很大的教化力量，就这一点而言，它的确达成了……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"We know that," interrupted Sermak, impatiently. "Get to the point."</p>
<p>“这些我们都知道，”瑟麦克不耐烦地打断他的话，“只说重点就好了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Here it is." Bort was a trifle disconcerted, but didn't show it. "Thereligion--which the Foundation has fostered and encouraged, mind you--isbuilt on on strictly authoritarian lines. The priesthood has sole controlof the instruments of science we have given Anacreon, but they've learnedto handle these tools only empirically. They believe in this religionentirely, and in the ... uh ... spiritual value of the power they handle. For instance, two months ago some fool tampered with the power plant in theThessalekian Temple--one of the large ones. He contaminated the city, ofcourse. It was considered divine vengeance by everyone, including thepriests."</p>
<p>“重点如下，”玻特感到有点窘，不过并未表现出来，“这个宗教——请各位注意，它是由基地所创立和提倡的——是建立在绝对威权的体制上。我们供给安纳克里昂的科学设备，只能由神职人员控制，但他们只学会了按部就班地操作。他们全心全意信仰这个宗教，也相信……嗯……他们所操纵的这些力量的形而上价值。举个例子来说，两个月以前，有个傻瓜搞坏了第沙雷克灵殿的发电厂——那是几座大型发电厂之一，当然整个城市都被污染了。结果每个人都认为那是神灵的惩罚，包括那些教士在内。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I remember. The papers had some garbled version of the story at the time. I don't see what you're driving at."</p>
<p>“我记得，当时报上曾经登过一点二手报道。我还是不明白你到底想说什么。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Then, listen," said Bort, stiffly. "The priesthood forms a hierarchy atthe apex of which is the king, who is regarded as a sort of minor god. He'san absolute monarch by divine right, and the people believe it, thoroughly,and the priests, too. You can't overthrow a king like that. Now do you getthe point?"</p>
<p>“那么请听着，”玻特以严肃的口吻说，“教士形成了一个特殊阶级，而国王位于这个阶级的顶峰，他被视为某种神祗。根据神的旨意，他成为具有绝对威权的君主；这种君权神授的思想，人民都深信不疑，连教士们也一样。这样的国王是无法推翻的，现在你懂了吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Hold on," said Walto, at this point. "What did you mean when you saidHardin's done all this? How does he come in?"</p>
<p>“且慢，”渥图道，“你说这些都是哈定安排的，这是什么意思？他是怎么插上一脚的？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Bort glanced at his questioner bitterly. "The Foundation has fostered thisdelusion assiduously. We've put all our scientific backing behind the hoax. There isn't a festival at which the king does not preside surrounded by aradioactive aura shining forth all over his body and raising itself like acoronet above his head. Anyone touching him is severely burned. He can movefrom place to place through the air at crucial moments, supposedly byinspiration of divine spirit. He fills the temple with a pearly, internallight at a gesture. There is no end to these quite simple tricks that weperform for his benefit; but even the priests believe them, while workingthem personally."</p>
<p>玻特以苦涩的目光瞥了瞥渥图。“基地千方百计创造了这个幻象，又将所有的科援都藏在这个幌子后面。国王每回主持重要庆典，放射性灵光一定笼罩全身，并在他头上形成王冠似的光环。此时若有人碰触国王，就会遭到严重灼伤。在典礼的关键时刻，国王还会在空中飞来飞去，表示他已经和神灵发生感应。而他做一个手势，就能使整座灵殿发出珍珠般的光芒。我们为国王设计的这些小把戏不胜枚举，那些教士参与实际工作，自己却也相信这一套。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Bad!" said Sermak, biting his lip.</p>
<p>“糟糕！”瑟麦克气得紧咬嘴唇。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I could cry-- like the fountain in City Hall Park," said Bort, earnestly,"when I think of the chance we muffed. Take the situation thirty years ago,when Hardin saved the Foundation from Anacreon-- At that time, theAnacreonian people had no real conception of the fact that the Empire wasrunning down. They had been more or less running their own affairs sincethe Zeonian revolt, but even after communications broke down and Lepold'spirate of a grandfather made himself king, they never quite realized theEmpire had gone kaput.</p>
<p>“每当想到我们错过大好时机，我真想号啕大哭，媲美市政厅公园的喷水池。”玻特认真地说，“想想三十年前的情况，哈定刚把基地从安纳克里昂手中解救出来——当时，安纳克里昂人还不清楚帝国已经开始衰落。自从宙昂人叛乱以来，他们一直自顾不暇，甚至当银河外缘和帝国断绝通讯，列普德的盗贼祖父自立为王时，他们仍然不晓得帝国已经分崩离析。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"If the Emperor had had the nerve to try, he could have taken over againwith two cruisers and with the help of the internal revolt that would havecertainly sprung to life. And we we could have done the same; but no,Hardin established monarch worship. Personally, I don't understand it. Why? Why? Why?"</p>
<p>“假如那时的皇帝有胆量，他只要派出两艘星际巡弋舰，配合安纳克里昂本身必然爆发的内乱，就能轻而易举将它收复。而我们，我们当时同样能够征服他们；哈定却没有这么做，反而为他们建立了君主崇拜制度。我个人真不了解，为什么？为什么？为什么？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"What," demanded Jaim Orsy, suddenly, "does Verisof do? There was a daywhen he was an advanced Actionist. What's he doing there? Is he blind,too?"</p>
<p>杰姆·欧西突然问道：“维瑞索夫如今在干什么？他曾经比今日的行动党员还要激进，现在他在那里做什么？难道他也瞎了吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I don't know," said Bort, curtly. "He's high priest to them. As far as I know, he does nothing but act as adviser to the priesthood on technical details. Figurehead, blast him, figurehead!"</p>
<p>“我不知道。”玻特生硬地说，“他现在是那里的教长。但据我所知，他只是担任教士的技术顾问而已。傀儡领袖，该死的家伙，傀儡！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>There was silence all round and all eyes turned to Sermak. The young partyleader was biting a fingernail nervously, and then said loudly, "No good. It's fishy!"</p>
<p>在座的人都沉默下来，大家不约而同望向瑟麦克。年轻的党魁神经质地咬了一阵指甲，然后高声说：“不好了，有问题！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He looked around him, and added more energetically, "Is Hardin then such afool?"</p>
<p>他环顾四周，以更有力的口吻说：“哈定会是这种笨蛋吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Seems to be," shrugged Bort.</p>
<p>“似乎如此。”玻特耸耸肩。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Never! There's something wrong. To cut our own throats so thoroughly andso hopelessly would require colossal stupidity. More than Hardin couldpossibly have even if he were a fool, which I deny. On the one hand, toestablish a religion that would wipe out all chance of internal troubles. On the other hand, to arm Anacreon with all weapons of warfare. I don't seeit."</p>
<p>“不可能！事情有点不对劲。让人如此任意宰割我们，这种事只有超级大笨蛋才做得出来。哈定即使是笨蛋，也不至于笨到那种程度，更何况我不承认他是笨蛋。他一方面创立宗教，为他们消除一切内乱的可能。另一方面，他又用各种武器把安纳克里昂武装起来。我不相信有这种事。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The matter is a little obscure, I admit, said Bort, "but the facts are there. What else can we think?"</p>
<p>“我也承认，事情的确有些蹊跷。”玻特说，“但是事实如此，我们还能怎么想呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Walto said, jerkily, "Outright treason. He's in their pay."</p>
<p>渥图万分激动地说：“这是公然叛变，他被收买了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>But Sermak shook his head impatiently. "I don't see that, either. The wholeaffair is as insane and meaningless-- Tell me, Bort, have you heardanything about a battle cruiser that the Foundation is supposed to have putinto shape for use in the Anacreon navy?"</p>
<p>瑟麦克却不耐烦地摇摇头。“这我也不相信。一切都显得既疯狂又没有意义。玻特，告诉我，你有没有听说有关那艘巡弋舰的任何消息，就是基地替安纳克里昂舰队修理的那艘星舰。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Battle cruiser?"</p>
<p>“巡弋舰？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"An old Imperial cruiser?</p>
<p>“一艘帝国时代的巡弋舰。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No, I haven't. But that doesn't mean much. The navy yards are religioussanctuaries completely inviolate on the part of the lay public. No one everhears anything about the fleet.</p>
<p>“没有，我没听说，但这并不能代表什么。舰队船坞是一般人绝对不准进入的宗教圣地。星际舰队的事，外人是不可能听说的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well, rumors have leaked out. Some of the Party have brought the matter upin Council. Hardin never denied it, you know. His spokesmen denounced rumormongers and let it go at that. It might have significance."</p>
<p>“嗯，还是有谣言流传出来。本党成员在议会里提起过这件事，你可知道，哈定从来没有否认。他的发言人曾经公开谴责造谣者，然后就不再过问了。这似乎饶有深意。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It's of a piece with the rest," said Bort. "if true, it's absolutelycrazy. But it wouldn't be worse than the rest."</p>
<p>“这是整个事件的环节之一，”玻特说，“倘若是真的，就疯狂得离谱了。可是，这件事不会比其他情况更糟。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I suppose," said Orsy, "Hardin hasn't any secret weapon waiting. Thatmight?</p>
<p>“我想，”欧西说，“哈定绝不会另外藏有什么秘密武器。也许……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes," said Sermak, viciously, "a huge jack-in-the-box that will jump outat the psychological moment and scare old Wienis into fits. The Foundationmay as well blow itself out of existence and save itself the agony ofsuspense if it has to depend on any secret weapon."</p>
<p>“是啊，”瑟麦克刻毒地说，“他不会藏有什么神灯魔盒，能在紧要关头跳出一个妖魔，把温尼斯那个老家伙吓得屁滚尿流。假如基地必须仰仗任何秘密武器，倒不如我们自己炸掉端点星，从提心吊胆的痛苦中解脱算了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Well," said Orsy, changing the subject hurriedly, "the question comes downto this: How much time have we left? Eli, Bort?"</p>
<p>“嗯，”欧西赶紧转变话题，“问题归结到一点：我们还有多少时间？啊，玻特？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"All fight. It is the question. But don't look at me; I don't know. TheAnacreonian press never mentions the Foundation at all. Right now, it'sfull of the approaching celebrations and nothing else. Lepold is coming ofage next week, you know."</p>
<p>“好吧，问题就在这里。但是别看我，我也不知道答案。安纳克里昂所有的传播媒体始终没有提到基地；最近则通通在报道庆典即将来临的消息，其他什么都没有。列普德下星期就成年了，你知道吧。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"We have months then." Walto smiled for the first time that evening. "Thatgives us time?</p>
<p>“那么我们还有几个月，”渥图露出今晚的第一个笑容，“这让我们还有时间……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That gives us time, my foot," ground out Bort, impatiently. "The king's agod, I tell you. Do you suppose he has to carry on a campaign of propagandato get his people into fighting spirit? Do you suppose he has to accuse usof aggression and pull out all stops on cheap emotionalism? When the timecomes to strike, Lepold gives the order and the people fight. Just likethat. Thatís the damnedness of the system. You donít question a god. He maygive the order tomorrow for all I know; and you can wrap tobacco round that and smoke it."</p>
<p>“还有时间，得了吧。”玻特咬牙切齿，显得很不耐烦，“我告诉你，那个国王是神。你以为他得利用宣传的手段，才能激起人民的斗志？你以为他必须指控我们侵略，还得放任人民敌视基地一阵子？只要时候到了，列普德一声令下，全民动员，就这么简单。这就是那种体制最要命的地方，因为你不能质疑神的决定。谁知道他会不会明天就下令，然后马上大军压境。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Everyone tried to talk at once and Sermak was slamming the table forsilence, when the front door opened and Levi Norast stamped in. He boundedup the stairs, overcoat on, trailing snow.</p>
<p>大家抢着发言，正当瑟麦克敲着桌子要大家安静，前门突然打开，李维·诺拉斯特大步走了进来。他跳上楼梯，大衣都没来得及脱，因而洒下一路雪花。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Look at that! he cried, tossing a cold, snow-speckled newspaper onto thetable. "The visicasters are full of it, too."</p>
<p>“看看这个！”他一面大喊，一面把沾着雪花的报纸扔到桌上，“新闻幕上也全都是这个消息。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The newspaper was unfolded and five heads bent over it.</p>
<p>报纸立刻被翻开来，五个头一起凑过去看。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak said, in a hushed voice, "Great Space, heís going to Anacreon! Goingto Anacreon!"</p>
<p>瑟麦克以沙哑的声音说：“太空啊，他要去安纳克里昂！去安纳克里昂！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It is treason," squeaked Tarki, in sudden excitement. "Iíll be damned ifWalto isnít right. Heís sold us out and now heís going there to collect hiswage."</p>
<p>“果然是叛国。”塔基突然激动地尖叫，“若是渥图说得不对，我甘愿自杀。他把我们出卖给敌人，现在要去领赏了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Sermak had risen. "Weíve no choice now. Iím going to ask the Counciltomorrow that Hardin be impeached. And if that fails……"</p>
<p>瑟麦克站了起来。“我们现在已经别无选择。明天在议会中，我将提议弹劾哈定。万一此举失败的话……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>3.5</p>
<p></p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The snow had ceased, but it caked the ground deeply now and the sleekground car advanced through the deserted streets with lumbering effort. Themurky gray light of incipient dawn was cold not only in the poetical sensebut also in a very literal way--and even in the then turbulent state ofthe Foundation's politics, no one, whether Actionist or pro-Hardin foundhis spirits sufficiently ardent to begin street activity that early.</p>
<p>雪已经停了，但是仍在地面凝成厚厚的一层。一辆光洁的地面车，在杳无人迹的街道上艰辛地前进。黎明时分，朦胧的曦光分外寒冷——这不只是诗意的描述，更是千真万确的事实。因此，即使如今基地的政治处于动荡状态，但无论行动党或亲哈定派，都没有任何人有足够的热诚与斗志，能这么早就开始进行街头活动。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Yohan Lee did not like that and his grumblings grew audible. "It's going tolook bad, Hardin. They're going to say you sneaked away."</p>
<p>约翰·李很不喜欢这种状况，他提高音量咕哝着。“哈定，这样很不好。他们会说你是溜走的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Let them say it if they wish. I've got to get to Anacreon and I want to doit without trouble. Now that's enough, Lee."</p>
<p>“想说就让他们说吧。我必须到安纳克里昂去，而且我要走得顺利。约翰，现在什么也别说了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin leaned back into the cushioned seat and shivered slightly. It wasn'tcold inside the well-heated car, but there was something frigid about asnow-covered world, even through glass, that annoyed him.</p>
<p>哈定仰靠在有衬垫的座椅上，身子有些发抖。车里装有暖气，其实并不冷，但是车外白雪覆盖的世界，虽是透过车窗看去，依然为他带来寒意。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He said, reflectively, "Some day when we get around to it we ought toweather-condition Terminus. It could be done."</p>
<p>哈定若有所思地说：“等到我们把这件事解决之后，应该设法控制端点星的气候。这并不是什么难事。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I," replied Lee, "would like to see a few other things done first. Forinstance, what about weather-conditioning Sermak? A nice, dry cell fittedfor twenty-five centigrade all year round would be just fight."</p>
<p>“我倒想先做几件其他的事。”约翰答道，“比如说，替瑟麦克控制气候如何？一间精致干爽的单人牢房，常年调节到摄氏二十五度，应该很适合他。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And then I'd really need bodyguards," said Hardin, "and not just thosetwo," He indicated two of Lee's bully-boys sitting up front with thedriver, hard eyes on the empty streets, ready hands at their atom blasts.</p>
<p>“这样一来，我可真的需要保镖了，”哈定说，“而不是只有这两位。”他指指那两名坐在司机旁边的约翰私人保镖，他们严峻的目光投射到空旷的街道，一手按在随身的核铳上。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You evidently want to stir up civil war."</p>
<p>“你显然打算挑起内战。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I do? There are other sticks in the fire and it won't require muchstirring, I can tell you." He counted off on blunt fingers, "One: Sermakraised hell yesterday in the City Council and called for an impeachment."</p>
<p>“我吗？我可以告诉你，火堆里早就有好多木柴，根本不用怎么拨动。”他扳着肥短的手指，“第一，瑟麦克昨天在市议会中高叫弹劾。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"He had a perfect right to do so," responded Hardin, coolly. "Besideswhich, his motion was defeated 206 to 184."</p>
<p>“他完全有这个权利，”哈定冷静地说，“不过，他的动议以206票对184票被否决了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Certainly. A majority of twenty-two when we had counted on sixty as aminimum. Don't deny it; you know you did."</p>
<p>“是的。只差22票而已，我们本来估计至少能赢60票。你别否认，你当初明明也这样想。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"It was close," admitted Hardin.</p>
<p>“的确很接近。”哈定承认。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"All right. And two; after the vote, the fifty-nine members of theActionist Party reared upon their hind legs and stamped out of the CouncilChambers."</p>
<p>“好的。第二，投票之后，59名行动党员愤而退席，浩浩荡荡步出市议厅。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin was silent, and Lee continued, "And three: Before leaving, Sermakhowled that you were a traitor, that you were going to Anacreon to collectyour payment, that the Chamber majority in refusing to vote impeachment hadparticipated in the treason, and that the name of their party was not'Actionist' for nothing. What does that sound like?"</p>
<p>哈定默然不语，约翰继续说：“第三，瑟麦克在退席之前，曾经高喊你是叛徒，说你到安纳克里昂是去领赏，又说拒绝弹劾你的多数派议员都等于加入了叛变行动，还说‘行动党’不是虚有其名。这些话听起来如何？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Trouble, I suppose."</p>
<p>“听起来像麻烦吧。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And now you're chasing off at daybreak, like a criminal. You ought to facethem, Hardin--and if you have to, declare martial law, by space!"</p>
<p>“而现在你却像个逃犯，一大清早就急着开溜。哈定，你应该面对他们——太空啊，若有必要，就发布戒严令！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Violence is the last refuge……"</p>
<p>“武力是——”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"……Of the incompetent. Bah!"</p>
<p>“——无能者最后的手段。得了吧！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"All right. We'll see. Now listen to me carefully, Lee. Thirty years ago,the Time Vault opened, and on the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning ofthe Foundation, there appeared a Hari Seldon recording to give us our firstidea of what was really going on."</p>
<p>“算了，等着看吧。约翰，现在注意听我说。三十年前，在基地创立五十周年纪念日那一天，时光穹窿开启，出现了哈里·谢顿的录像，首度告诉我们部分的事实真相。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I remember," Lee nodded reminiscently, with a half smile. "It was the daywe took over the government."</p>
<p>“我记得，”约翰忆起往事，似笑非笑地点点头，“就是我们接管政府的那一天。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That's right. It was the time of our first major crisis. This is oursecond-and three weeks from today will be the eightieth anniversary of thebeginning of the Foundation. Does that strike you as in any waysignificant?"</p>
<p>“没错，那是我们遭遇初次危机的时候。现在这个则是第二次——三个星期后，便是基地创立八十周年纪念日。你不觉得这里头有深意吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You mean he's coming again?"</p>
<p>“你是说他还会出现？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I'm not finished. Seldon never said anything about returning, youunderstand, but that's of a piece with his whole plan. He's always done hisbest to keep all foreknowledge from us. Nor is there any way of tellingwhether the computer is set for further openings short of dismantling theVault-- and it's probably set to destroy itself if we were to try that. I've been there every anniversary since the first appearance, just on thechance. He's never shown up, but this is the first time since then thatthere's really been a crisis."</p>
<p>“我还没有说完。谢顿从未提过他是否还会出现，你了解的，但那也是他整个计划的一部分。他总是尽量不让我们预知任何细节。我们根本无法知道电脑何时会令影像再度出现，除非我们将穹窿拆开——可是如果那么做，说不定电脑会自动销毁。自从谢顿上次出现后，每年的纪念日，我都会去那里碰碰运气。他从来没有再现身，话说回来，自从那次之后，如今才再度发生真正的危机。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Then he'll come."</p>
<p>“那么他会再出现。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Maybe. I don't know. However, this is the point. At today's session of theCouncil, just after you announce that I have left for Anacreon, you willfurther announce, officially, that on March 14th next, there will beanother Hari Seldon recording, containing a message of the utmostimportance regarding the recent successfully concluded crisis. That's veryimportant, Lee. Don't add anything more no matter how many questions areasked."</p>
<p>“可能吧，我也不知道。然而，这正是重点。你今天在市议会中，先宣布我到安纳克里昂去的消息，然后紧接着，再正式宣布谢顿的录像将在三月十四日再度出现。对于最近这个圆满解决的危机，这段录像将会传达最重要的讯息。约翰，这点非常重要。但是不管别人怎么追问，你都别再多说什么。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee stared. "Will they believe it?"</p>
<p>约翰瞪着哈定。“他们会相信吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That doesn't matter. It will confuse them, which is all I want. Betweenwondering whether it is true and what I mean by it if it isn't--they'lldecide to postpone action till after March 14th. I'll be back considerably before then."</p>
<p>“那倒没有关系。这样做会令他们困惑，这就是我的目的。他们会怀疑这件事的真实性，还会猜测万一是假的，我的真正意图究竟又是什么——举棋不定之下，他们会决定将行动延到三月十四日之后。那时候，我早已经回来了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee looked uncertain. "But that 'successfully concluded.' That's bull!"</p>
<p>约翰看来仍然犹豫不决。“但你所谓的‘已经圆满解决的危机’，根本是唬人嘛！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Highly confusing bull. Here's the airport!"</p>
<p>“足以唬得他们一愣一愣的。飞航站到了！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The waiting spaceship bulked somberly in the dimness. Hardin stampedthrough the snow toward it and at the open air lock turned about withoutstretched hand.</p>
<p>太空船的庞大身躯在微光中若隐若现。哈定踏着积雪走向太空船，到达气闸时又转过头来，伸出手对约翰挥了挥。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Good-by, Lee. I hate to leave you in the frying pan like this, but there'snot another I can trust. Now please keep out of the fire."</p>
<p>“约翰，再见。我很不想留你在油锅里受煎熬，但是除了你，我再也没有可以信赖的人。记住，千万别玩火。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Don't worry. The frying pan is hot enough. I'll follow orders." He steppedback, and the air lock closed.</p>
<p>“别担心，油锅已经够热了。我会服从命令的。”约翰向后退去，气闸也关上了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>3.6</p>
<p></p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Salvor Hardin did not travel to the planet Anacreon--from which planet thekingdom derived its name--immediately. It was only on the day before thecoronation that he arrived, after having made flying visits to eight of thelarger stellar systems of the kingdom, stopping only long, enough to conferwith the local representatives of the Foundation.</p>
<p>塞佛·哈定并未直接来到安纳克里昂星——安纳克里昂王国就是根据这颗行星命名的。直到加冕的前一天，他才抵达这个首都世界。在此之前，他飞到这个王国八个较大的恒星系，每一站都只作极短暂的停留，时间刚好足够让他会晤基地驻当地的代表。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The trip left him with an oppressive realization of the vastness of thekingdom. It was a little splinter, an insignificant fly speck compared tothe inconceivable reaches of the Galactic Empire of which it had onceformed so distinguished a part; but to one whose habits of thought had beenbuilt around a single planet, and a sparsely settled one at that,Anacreon's size in area and population was staggering.</p>
<p>这一趟旅行，使他深深体会到这个王国幅员的辽阔。这里曾经是银河帝国极具特色的一部分，可是与昔日帝国不可思议的广大版图相比，它只不过是一个小碎片、一颗毫不起眼的苍蝇屎。然而哈定的思考模式，一向只习惯于单一的行星，而且还是一颗人口稀疏的行星，因此安纳克里昂的幅员与人口，已经足以令他吃惊不已。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Following closely the boundaries of the old Prefect of Anacreon, itembraced twenty-five stellar systems, six of which included more than oneinhabited world. The population of nineteen billion, though still far lessthan it had been in the Empire's heyday was rising rapidly with the increasing scientific development fostered by the Foundation.</p>
<p>如今安纳克里昂王国的国境，与当年的安纳克里昂星郡极为接近，境内包括二十五个恒星系，其中六个拥有不只一颗住人行星。目前它的总人口数为一百九十亿，虽然与它在帝国全盛时期的数目无法相比，但由于基地的科援促进了科学发展，总人口正在急速增长中。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And it was only now that Hardin found himself floored by the magnitude ofthat task. Even in thirty years, only the capital world had been powered. The outer provinces still possessed immense stretches where nuclear powerhad not yet been re-introduced. Even the progress that had been made mighthave been impossible had it not been for the still workable relics leftover by the ebbing tide of Empire.</p>
<p>哈定直到现在，才真正体认到这项科援工作的艰巨。虽然花了三十年的时间，却只在首都世界建立了核电系统，王国外围仍有广大区域尚未恢复核能发电。甚至这样的小小成绩，都还是利用帝国残留下的设备拼凑而成，否则连这一点进展都不可能有。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>When Hardin did arrive at the capital world, it was to find all normalbusiness at an absolute standstill. In the outer provinces there had beenand still were celebrations; but here on the planet Anacreon, not a personbut took feverish part in the hectic religious pageantry that heralded thecoming-of-age of their god-king, Lepold.</p>
<p>当哈定终于抵达这个首都世界的时候，发现一切商业活动完全停摆。在外围区域，庆祝活动已经持续若干时日；而在安纳克里昂星上，处处都是预祝国王列普德成年的狂热宗教庆典，人人都热情万分地全心投入。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin had been able to snatch only half an hour from a haggard and harried Verisof before his ambassador was forced to rush off to supervise still another temple festival. But the half-hour was a most profitable one, and Hardin prepared himself for the night's fireworks well satisfied.</p>
<p>哈定设法找到他们的大使维瑞索夫，后者由于过分忙碌而显得愁眉苦脸、形容憔悴。他们只交谈了半个小时，维瑞索夫就被迫匆匆告退，去监督另一座灵殿的庆典。但是这半小时让哈定获益匪浅，他已经胸有成竹，准备参加当天晚上的烟火盛会。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>In all, he acted as an observer, for he had no stomach for the religioustasks he would undoubtedly have had to undertake if his identity becameknown. So, when the palace's ballroom filled itself with a glittering hordeof the kingdom's very highest and most exalted nobility, he found himselfhugging the wall, little noticed or totally ignored.</p>
<p>这次哈定完全是以游客的身份出现，因为万一他的身份曝光，将必然得主导宗教性活动，而他毫无心情做那些无聊的事情。因此，当王宫大厅挤满珠光宝气的王公贵族时，他夹在其中一点也不起眼，几乎没有人注意到他，更没有人跟他打招呼。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He had been introduced to Lepold as one of a long line of introducees, andfrom a safe distance, for the king stood apart in lonely and impressivegrandeur, surrounded by his deadly blaze of radioactive aura. And in lessthan an hour this same king would take his seat upon the massive throne ofrhodium-iridium alloy with jewel-set gold chasings, and then, throne andall would rise maestically into the air, skim the ground slowly to hoverbefore the great window from which the great crowds of common folk couldsee their king and shout themselves into near apoplexy. The throne wouldnot have been so massive, of course, if it had not had a shielded nuclearmotor built into it.</p>
<p>哈定站在长串的参谒者中，在安全距离之外被引见给列普德国王，国王则独自威严地站在放射性灵光的眩目光芒中。不到一小时之后，国王将要坐在镶着宝石、装饰着黄金浮雕、由铑铱合金制成的厚重王座上，与王座一起庄严地升到半空中，再缓缓贴地飞掠到窗口，然后在王宫的窗前翱翔，让外面成千上万的百姓瞻仰，接受百姓近乎疯狂的热情欢呼。当然，若不是内部暗藏核能发动机，王座也不可能那么沉重。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>It was past eleven. Hardin fidgeted and stood on his toes to better hisview. He resisted an impulse to stand on a chair. And then he saw Wienisthreading through the crowd toward him and he relaxed.</p>
<p>这时已经十一点多了。哈定开始坐立不安，于是踮起脚尖想看得清楚一点。他甚至想站到椅子上，不过总算忍住这个冲动。终于，他看见温尼斯穿过人群向他走来，心情顿时轻松了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis' progress was slow. At almost every step, he had to pass a kindlysentence with some revered noble whose grandfather had helped Lepold'sgrandfather brigandize the kingdom and had received a dukedom therefor.</p>
<p>温尼斯走得很慢。他几乎每走一步，就得跟一些尊贵的贵族亲切寒暄。那些贵族的祖辈都曾协助列普德的祖父僭取王位，从此子孙便永远承袭爵位。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And then he disentangled himself from the last uniformed peer and reachedHardin. His smile crooked itself into a smirk and his black eyes peeredfrom under grizzled brows with glints of satisfaction in them.</p>
<p>温尼斯终于摆脱最后一位贵族，来到哈定面前。他勉强挤出几丝笑容，斑白眉毛下的黑色眼珠射出得意的光芒。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"My dear Hardin," he said, in a low voice, "you must expect to be bored,when you refuse to announce your identity."</p>
<p>“亲爱的哈定，”他低声说，“你不肯表露自己的身份，想必一定会很无聊。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I am not bored, your highness. This is all extremely interesting. We haveno comparable spectacles on Terminus, you know."</p>
<p>“殿下，我并不觉得无聊。这一切都太有趣了，您也知道，端点星可没有这么隆重的庆典。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No doubt. But would you care to step into my private chambers, where wecan speak at greater length and with considerably more privacy?"</p>
<p>“毋庸置疑。愿不愿意到我的书房坐坐，我们可以无拘无束地畅谈一番。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<p>“当然好。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>With arms linked, the two ascended the staircase, and more than one dowagerduchess stared after them in surprise and wondered at the identity of thisinsignificantly dressed and uninteresting-looking stranger on whom suchsignal honor was being conferred by the prince regent.</p>
<p>于是两人臂挽着臂上楼去了。几位公爵夫人惊讶地盯着他们的背影，怎么也想不通哈定的身份。这个衣着平凡、外表毫不起眼的陌生人，竟然受到摄政王这般的礼遇，他究竟是什么人？</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>In Wienis' chambers, Hardin relaxed in perfect comfort and accepted with amurmur of gratitude the glass of liquor that had been poured out by theregent's own hand.</p>
<p>进了温尼斯的书房，哈定十分轻松地坐了下来。他接过摄政王亲自斟的一杯酒，并低声表示谢意。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Locris wine, Hardin," said Wienis, "from the royal cellars. The real thing? two centuries in age. It was laid down ten years before the ZeonianRebellion."</p>
<p>“哈定，这是卢奎斯酒，”温尼斯说，“是王室酒窖中的真品——珍藏了两个世纪，是宙昂叛乱之前十年所酿制的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"A really royal drink," agreed Hardin, politely. "To Lepold I, King ofAnacreon."They drank, and Wienis added blandly, at the pause, "</p>
<p>“真正的王室佳酿。”哈定礼貌地附和着，“敬列普德一世，安纳克里昂之王。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And soon to be Emperorof the Periphery, and further, who knows? The Galaxy may some day bereunited."</p>
<p>两人干杯后，温尼斯轻声补充道：“他很快就会成为银河外缘的皇帝，而接下来，又有谁能预料呢？银河总该有再统一的一天。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Undoubtedly. By Anacreon?"</p>
<p>“毫无疑问。是由安纳克里昂统一吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Why not? With the help of the Foundation, our scientific superiority overthe rest of the Periphery would be undisputable.</p>
<p>“有何不可？在基地的协助下，我们的科技优于银河外缘其他世界，这是毫无疑问的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin set his empty glass down and said, "Well, yes, except that, ofcourse, the Foundation is bound to help any nation that requests scientificaid of it. Due to the high idealism of our government and the great moralpurpose of our founder, Hari Seldon, we are unable to play favorites. Thatcan't be helped, your highness."</p>
<p>哈定放下空酒杯，然后说：“嗯，没错，只是，基地理当协助任何一个需要科援的国家。基于我们政府的高度理想主义，以及基地缔造者哈里·谢顿崇高的道德目标，我们绝不能偏袒任何国家。殿下，这是无法改变的原则。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis' smile broadened. "The Galactic Spirit, to use the popular cant,helps those who help themselves. I quite understand that, left to itself,the Foundation would never cooperate."</p>
<p>温尼斯笑得更加灿烂。“套一句当今的俗话：‘灵助自助者’。我相当了解，基地若不是受到压力，绝不可能这么合作。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I wouldn't say that. We repaired the Imperial cruiser for you, though myboard of navigation wished it for themselves for research purposes."</p>
<p>“这点我可不敢苟同。至少基地为你们修理了那艘帝国巡弋舰，虽然我们的宇航局一直希望拿来作研究之用。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The regent repeated the last words ironically. "Research purposes! Yeeeeeetyou would not have repaired it, had I not threatened war."</p>
<p>摄政王以讽刺的口吻，重复着哈定所说的话。“研究之用！是啊！若非我威胁要开战，你们是绝不肯修理的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin made a deprecatory gesture. "I don't know."</p>
<p>哈定做了一个不以为然的手势。“这我就不知道了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I do. And that threat always stood."</p>
<p>“我知道，而且知道这种威胁永远有效。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And still stands now?"</p>
<p>“现在也有效吗？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Now it is rather too late to speak of threats." Wienis had cast a rapidglance at the clock on his desk. "Look here, Hardin, you were on Anacreononce before. You were young then; we were both young. But even then we hadentirely different ways of looking at things. You're what they call a manof peace, aren't you?"</p>
<p>“现在谈威胁有点太迟了。”温尼斯瞥了一眼书桌上的时钟，“哈定，听好，你以前来过安纳克里昂。当年你还年轻，你我都很年轻。即使那个时候，我们的行事方法已经迥然不同。你是所谓的和平主义者，对吧？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I suppose I am. At least, I consider violence an uneconomical way ofattaining an end. There are always better substitutes, though they maysometimes be a little less direct."</p>
<p>“我想大概是吧。至少，我认为以武力达到目的，是一种很不划算的手段。总会有更好的替代方案，虽然有时比较不那么直接。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yee. I've heard of your famous remark: 'Violence is the last refuge of theincompetent.' And yet"--the regent scratched one ear gently in affectedabstraction--I wouldn't call myself exactly incompetent."</p>
<p>“是啊，我听过你的名言：‘武力是无能者最后的手段’。但是，”摄政王故意像是不经意地抓抓耳朵，“我并不认为自己是个无能者。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin nodded politely and said nothing.</p>
<p>哈定礼貌地点点头，却一言不发。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And in spite of that," Wienis continued, "I have always believed in directaction. I have believed in carving a straight path to my objective andfollowing that path. I have accomplished much that way, and fully expect toaccomplish still more."</p>
<p>“除此之外，”温尼斯继续说，“我一直信赖直接路线。我相信应该对准目标笔直地开拓道路，再沿着这条直路不偏不倚地前进。我曾经用这个方法取得许多成就，今后还打算完成更多的功业。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I know," interrupted Hardin. "I believe you are carving a path such as youdescribe for yourself and your children that leads directly to the throne,considering the late unfortunate death of the king's father--your elderbrother and the king's own precarious state of health. He is in aprecarious state of health, is he not?"</p>
<p>“我都知道。”哈定插嘴道，“我相信您现在开拓的道路，是为了要让您和令公子直达王位。想想国王的父亲——就是您的兄长——所遭遇的不幸意外，以及当今国王欠佳的健康状况。他的确健康欠佳，对不对？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis frowned at the shot, and his voice grew harder. "You might find itadvisable, Hardin, to avoid certain subjects. You may consider yourselfprivileged as mayor of Terminus to make ... uh ... injudicious remarks, butif you do, please disabuse yourself of the notion. I am not one to befrightened at words. It has been my philosophy of life that difficultiesvanish when faced boldly, and I have never turned my back upon one yet."</p>
<p>温尼斯皱起眉头，声音变得更加严厉。“哈定，为了你自己好，我劝你最好避免某些话题。或许你以为自己是端点星的市长，就有特权可以说……唔……这种不负责任的话；假如你真的这么想，还请你及早醒悟。我可不是会被空口白话吓倒的人。我的人生哲学是只要勇敢面对难题，难题便会消失，而我从来没有逃避过任何难题。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I don't doubt that. What particular difficulty are you refusing to turnyour back upon at the present moment?"</p>
<p>“这点我并不怀疑。请问此时您拒绝逃避的难题究竟是什么？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"The difficulty, Hardin, of persuading the Foundation to co-operate. Yourpolicy of peace, you see, has led you into making several very seriousmistakes, simply because you underestimated the boldness of your adversary. Not everyone is as afraid of direct action as you are."</p>
<p>“哈定，就是说服基地合作。你可知道，你的和平政策使你犯了几个非常严重的错误，只因为你低估了对手的勇气。并不是每个人都像你一样害怕直接行动。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"For instance?" suggested Hardin.</p>
<p>“比如说？”哈定问道。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"For instance, you came to Anacreon alone and accompanied me to my chambersalone."</p>
<p>“比如说，你单独来到安纳克里昂，并且单独跟我进入我的书房。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin looked about him. "And what is wrong with that?"</p>
<p>哈定环顾四周。“那又有什么不对？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Nothing," said the regent, "except that outside this room are five policeguards, well armed and ready to shoot. I don't think you can leave,Hardin."</p>
<p>“没什么，”摄政王说，“只不过屋外有五名警卫，他们全副武装，手握核铳。哈定，我不相信你走得出去。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The mayor's eyebrows lifted, "I have no immediate desire to leave. Do youthen fear me so much?"</p>
<p>市长扬了扬眉。“我一时还不想走呢。您真的那么怕我？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I don't fear you at all. But this may serve to impress you with mydetermination. Shall we call it a gesture?"</p>
<p>“我一点也不怕你。但是，这样能让你体认到我的决心。我们称之为一种姿态，如何？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Call it what you please," said Hardin, indifferently. "I shall notdiscommode myself over the incident, whatever you choose to call it."</p>
<p>“您爱怎么称呼随便您，”哈定不在乎地说，“您怎么称呼都一样，反正我不会放在心上。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I'm sure that attitude will change with time. But you have made anothererror, Hardin, a more serious one. It seems that the planet Terminus isalmost wholly undefended."</p>
<p>“我确定你这种态度迟早会改变。哈定，但你还犯了另一个错误，一个更为严重的错误。端点星好像是几乎完全不设防的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Naturally. What have we to fear? We threaten no one's interest and serveall alike."</p>
<p>“当然，我们需要怕谁？我们没有威胁到任何人的利益，并且一视同仁地提供科援。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And while remaining helpless," Wienis went on, "you kindly helped us toarm ourselves, aiding us particularly in the development of a navy of ourown, a great navy. In fact, a navy which, since your donation of theImperial cruiser, is quite irresistible."</p>
<p>“虽然保持无武装的状态，但是另一方面，”温尼斯说，“你又慷慨地帮我们建军，特别是协助我们建立自己的舰队，一个庞大的星际舰队。事实上，自从你们将修好的帝国巡弋舰献给我们，这个舰队已经所向无敌。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Your highness, you are wasting time." Hardin made as if to rise from hisseat. "If you mean to declare war, and are informing me of the fact, youwill allow me to communicate with my government at once."</p>
<p>“殿下，您这是在浪费时间。”哈定作势要站起来，“假如您意图向我们宣战，而且正在知会我这个事实，请您允许我立即和我的政府联络。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Sit down, Hardin. I am not declaring war, and you are not communicatingwith your government at all. When the war is fought--not declared, Hardin,fought-- the Foundation will be informed of it in due time by the nuclearblasts of the Anacreonian navy under the lead of my own son upon theflagship, Wienis, once a cruiser of the Imperial navy."</p>
<p>“哈定，坐下来。我并不是向你们宣战，你也根本别想通知你的政府。一度曾是帝国舰队巡弋舰的温尼斯号，现在是我国远征舰队的旗舰。这个远征舰队，由我儿子在旗舰上亲自指挥，一旦开战——哈定，是开战而不是宣战——他们立刻会对基地发动核武攻击，那时基地自然就会知道了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin frowned. "When will all this happen?"</p>
<p>哈定皱起眉头。“什么时候会开战？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"If you're really interested, the ships of the fleet left Anacreon exactlyfifty minutes ago, at eleven, and the first shot will be fired as soon asthey sight Terminus, which should be at noon tomorrow. You may consideryourself a prisoner of war."</p>
<p>“既然你有兴趣知道，舰队在五十分钟前，十一点整的时候，刚刚离开安纳克里昂。当他们能目视端点星的时候，就会发动第一波攻击，那应该是明天中午的事。你可以把自己当做一名战俘了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"That's exactly what I do consider myself, your highness," said Hardin,still frowning. "But I'm disappointed."</p>
<p>“殿下，我自己正是这么想的。”哈定仍然皱着眉头，“但是我很失望。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis chuckled contemptuously. "Is that all?"</p>
<p>温尼斯轻蔑地咯咯大笑。“如此而已？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes. I had thought that the moment of coronation-- midnight, you know-- would be the logical time to set the fleet in motion. Evidently, you wanted to start the war while you were still regent. It would have been moredramatic the other way."</p>
<p>“是的。我曾经想过，在加冕典礼开始的同时——也就是午夜零时——才是舰队行动最合理的时刻。因为很明显，您希望在您摄政王任内开战。倘若这样做，应该更具戏剧性。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The regent stared. "What in Space are you talking about?"</p>
<p>摄政王瞪着对方。“太空啊，你到底在说什么？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Don't you understand?" said Hardin, softly. "I had set my counterstrokefor midnight."</p>
<p>“您没听懂吗？”哈定轻描淡写地说道，“我把反击时刻定在午夜零时。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis started from his chair. "You are not bluffing me. There is nocounterstroke. If you are counting on the support of the other kingdoms,forget it. Their navies, combined, are no match for ours."</p>
<p>温尼斯从椅子上跳起来。“你别想虚张声势吓唬我，你们不可能会反击。如果你指望其他王国的协助，死了这条心吧。他们的舰队全部加起来，也不是我们的对手。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I know that. I don't intend firing a shot. It is simply that the word wentout a week ago that at midnight tonight, the planet Anacreon goes under theinterdict."</p>
<p>“这我知道，但我并不打算发射一枪一弹。我只是一周前就让人放出风声，说在今晚午夜，安纳克里昂星将实施‘教禁’。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"The interdict?"</p>
<p>“教禁？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Yes. If you don't understand, I might explain that every priest inAnacreon is going on strike, unless I countermand the order. But I can'twhile I'm being held incommunicado; nor do I wish to even if I weren't!" Heleaned forward and added, with sudden animation, "Do you realize, yourhighness, that an attack on the Foundation is nothing short of sacrilege ofthe highest order?"</p>
<p>“是的，假如您还不懂，我可以解释一下：除非我收回成命，安纳克里昂所有的教士都会开始罢工。可是如今我遭到软禁，不能跟外界联络；不过即使没被软禁，我也不打算这么做。”他上身向前倾，语气忽然变得生动起来，“殿下，您可了解，攻击基地等于是罪大恶极的亵渎行为？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis was groping visibly for self-control. "Give me none of that, Hardin. Save it for the mob."</p>
<p>温尼斯显然在勉力恢复镇定。“哈定，别对我来这一套。这些话留着对群众说吧。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"My dear Wienis, whoever do you think I am saving it for? I imagine thatfor the last half hour every temple on Anacreon has been the center of amob listening to a priest exhorting them upon that very subject. There'snot a man or woman on Anacreon that doesn't know that their government haslaunched a vicious, unprovoked attack upon the center of their religion. But it lacks only four minutes of midnight now. You'd better go down to theballroom to watch events. I'll be safe here with five guards outside thedoor."</p>
<p>“亲爱的温尼斯，除了群众，您认为我还会把这番话留给谁呢？我可以想象，在过去半小时中，安纳克里昂所有的灵殿都已经聚满群众，在聆听教士对这个事件的训诫。如今安纳克里昂的男女老幼，每个人都已经知道，自己的政府正在对他们的信仰中心发动邪恶而不义的攻击。现在，还差四分钟就到午夜了，您最好下楼到大厅去看看吧。既然有五名警卫在门外，不必担心我会溜走。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p> He leaned back in his chair, helped himself to another glass of Locris wine, and gazed at the ceiling with perfect indifference.</p>
<p>他又靠回椅背，并帮自己再倒了一杯卢奎斯酒，然后无动于衷地盯着天花板。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis suddenly furious, rushed out of the room.</p>
<p>温尼斯突然怒不可遏，飞快地冲出书房。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>A hush had fallen over the elite in the ballroom, as a broad path wascleared for the throne. Lepold sat on it now, hands solidly on its arms,head high, face frozen. The huge chandeliers had dimmed and in the diffusedmulti-colored light from the tiny nucleo-bulbs that bespangled the vaultedceiling, the royal aura shone out bravely, lifting high above his head toform a blazing coronet.</p>
<p>在大厅中，所有的名士淑女都鸦雀无声，让出一条通向王座的宽敞通道。列普德坐在王座上，两手紧抓着扶手，头抬得很高，表情却僵凝着。中央的大吊灯渐渐暗下来，拱型天花板上镶嵌的无数核灯泡散发出彩色的闪光。就在此时，国王周围的绚丽灵光开始闪耀，并且上升到他的头顶，凝聚成一顶耀眼的王冠。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis paused on the stairway. No one saw him; all eyes were on the throne. He clenched his fists and remained where he was; Hardin would not bluff him into action.</p>
<p>温尼斯停在楼梯半途。没有人看到他，所有的眼睛都注视着王座。温尼斯在那里站定，双手紧握着拳；哈定的虚言恫吓不至于让他贸然行事。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And then the throne stiffed. Noiselessly, it lifted upward--and drifted. Off the dais, slowly down the steps, and then horizontally, fivecentimetres off the floor, it worked itself toward the huge, open window.</p>
<p>这时王座开始颤动，然后无声无息地垂直上升，接着开始飘移。王座离开了座台，缓缓飘下阶梯，在离地五公分处停下，再水平地滑向巨大的窗口。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>At the sound of the deep-toned bell that signified midnight, it stoppedbefore the window--and the king's aura died.</p>
<p>深沉的钟声响起，代表午夜的降临。王座刚好停在窗前——国王头上的灵光消失了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>For a frozen split second, the king did not move, face twisted in surprise,without an aura, merely human; and then the throne wobbled and dropped tothe floor with a crashing thump, just as every light in the palace wentout. </p>
<p>在那一瞬间，国王毫无动作，脸孔却因惊惧而扭曲；一旦失去灵光，他就变得与常人无异。接着王座摇晃了几下，便重重落在地板上，发出一声巨响，宫中所有的灯光也同时暗下来。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Through the shrieking din and confusion, Wienis' bull voice sounded. "Getthe flares! Get the flares!"</p>
<p>在嘈杂的尖叫声与一片混乱中，传来温尼斯的吼叫：“拿火把来！拿火把来！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He buffeted right and left through the crowd and forced his way to thedoor. From without, palace guards had streamed into the darkness.</p>
<p>温尼斯在拥挤的人群中左冲右撞，拼命挤到了门口。此时，宫中卫士也从外面冲进黑暗的大厅。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Somehow the flares were brought back to the ballroom; flares that were tohave been used in the gigantic torchlight procession through the streets ofthe city after the coronation.</p>
<p>然后火把终于拿到大厅来了。那是原先准备在加冕典礼后，在大街小巷举行盛大的火炬游行用的。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Back to the ballroom guardsmen swarmed with torches--blue, green, and red;where the strange light lit up frightened, confused faces.</p>
<p>卫士们举着火把，蜂拥进入大厅——蓝色、绿色、红色的光芒，照在一张张恐惧惶惑的脸上。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"There is no harm done," shouted Wienis. "Keep your places. Power willreturn in a moment."</p>
<p>“没有大碍，”温尼斯大声喊道，“大家留在原地别动，电力马上会恢复。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He turned to the captain of the guard who stood stiffly at attention. "Whatis it, Captain?"</p>
<p>温尼斯转身，向立正站好的卫士长问道：“队长，怎么回事？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Your highness," was the instant response, "the palace is surrounded by thepeople of the city."</p>
<p>“殿下，”卫士长立即回答，“宫殿被城里的百姓包围了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"What do they want?" snarled Wienis.</p>
<p>“他们要什么？”温尼斯咆哮道。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"A priest is at the head. He has been identified as High Priest PolyVerisof. He demands the immediate release of Mayor Salvor Hardin andcessation of the war against the Foundation." The report was made in theexpressionless tones of an officer, but his eyes shifted uneasily.</p>
<p>“他们由一名教士带头，有人认出他就是教长波利·维瑞索夫。他要求立刻释放塞佛·哈定市长，并且停止对基地的战争。”卫士长以军人特有的冰冷语气回答，但他的目光却游移不定。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis cried, "if any of the rabble attempt to pass the palace gates, blastthem out of existence. For the moment, nothing more. Let them howl! There will be an accounting tomorrow."alight.</p>
<p>温尼斯叫道：“若有任何暴民妄图越过宫门，一律格杀勿论。暂时就是这样。让他们去吼吧！明天再跟他们算账。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The torches had been distributed now, and the ballroom was again Wienis rushed to the throne, still standing by the window, and dragged thestricken, wax-faced Lepold to his feet.</p>
<p>火把已经分发下去，大厅又重放光明。温尼斯赶紧冲向仍在窗口的王座，把惊吓得面无人色的列普德拉起来。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Come with me." He cast one look out of the window. The city waspitch-black. From below there were the hoarse confused cries of the mob.Only toward the fight, where the Argolid Temple stood was thereillumination. He swore angrily, and dragged the king away.</p>
<p>“跟我来。”他向窗外看了一眼，整个城市一片漆黑，下面传来群众沙哑嘈杂的吼声。放眼望去，只有右方的艾哥里德灵殿灯火辉煌。他一面暴跳如雷地咒骂，一面把国王拖走。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis burst into his chambers, the five guardsmen at his heels. Lepoldfollowed, wide-eyed, scared speechless.</p>
<p>温尼斯一路冲回自己的书房，门口五名警卫立刻跟进来。列普德走在最后面，他瞪大眼睛，吓得一句话也说不出来。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Hardin," said Wienis, huskily, "you are playing with forces too great for you."</p>
<p>“哈定，”温尼斯用沙哑的声音说，“你这是在玩火自焚。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The mayor ignored the speaker. In the pearly light of the pocketnucleo-bulb at his side, he remained quietly seated, a slightly ironicsmile on his face.</p>
<p>哈定市长身旁有一个手提式核灯泡，发出珍珠般的光芒。他根本不理会温尼斯，只是静静地坐着，脸上挂着一丝嘲弄的微笑。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Good morning, your majesty," he said to Lepold. "I congratulate you onyour coronation."</p>
<p>“陛下，早安。”哈定对列普德说，“恭喜您顺利加冕。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Hardin," cried Wienis again, "order your priests back to their jobs."</p>
<p>“哈定，”温尼斯再度吼道，“命令你的教士回去工作。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin looked up coolly. "Order them yourself, Wienis, and see who isplaying with forces too great for whom. Right now, there's not a wheelturning in Anacreon. There's not a light burning, except in the temples. There's not a drop of water running, except in the temples. On the wintryhalf of the planet, there's not a calorie of heat, except in the temples. The hospitals are taking in no more patients. The power plants have shutdown. All ships are grounded. If you don't like it, Wienis, you can orderthe priests back to their jobs. I don't wish to."</p>
<p>哈定冷静地抬起头来。“温尼斯，你自己下令吧，看看我们两人到底谁在玩火。现在整个安纳克里昂，除了灵殿之外，没有任何机械在运转；除了灵殿之外，没有任何灯泡发光；除了灵殿之外，没有一滴自来水；处于冬季的半球，除了灵殿之外，连一卡的热量都没有。医院无法再接受病患，发电厂也将被迫关闭，所有的太空船都被困在地面。温尼斯，如果你不喜欢这种情况，大可自己命令教士回去工作，我可不想管。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"By Space, Hardin, I will. If it's to be a showdown, so be it. We'll see ifyour priests can withstand the army. Tonight, every temple on the planetwill be put under army supervision."</p>
<p>“哈定，我对太空发誓，我一定会下令。倘若非得摊牌不可，那就来吧。看看你的教士能不能挡住我的军队。今天晚上，这颗行星上所有的灵殿都会被军方接管。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Very good, but how are you going to give the orders? Every line ofcommunication on the planet is shut down. You'll find that neither wave norhyperwave will work. In fact, the only communicator of the planet that willwork-- outside of the temples, of course--is the televisor right here inthis room, and I've fitted it only for reception."</p>
<p>“很好，但是你要怎样下令呢？这颗行星上所有的通讯线路都已中断，你将发现无论电波或超波都失灵了。事实上，这个房间里的影像电话，是这颗行星上唯一还有效的通讯器材——当然，我是指灵殿以外的地方——但我已经将它设定成只能接收讯号。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis struggled vainly for breath, and Hardin continued, "If you wish youcan order your army into the Argolid Temple just outside the palace andthen use the ultrawave sets there to contact other portions of the planet. But if you do that, I'm afraid the army contigent will be cut to pieces bythe mob, and then what will protect your palace, Wienis? And your lives,Wienis?"</p>
<p>温尼斯似乎喘不过气来，哈定继续说：“如果你想试试，可以派遣军队到宫殿附近的艾哥里德灵殿，利用那里的超波通讯器和本星的其他区域联络。但如果你真那样做，派出去的军队恐怕会被暴民分尸。温尼斯，那时谁来保护这座宫殿呢？谁又来保护你们的性命呢？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis said thickly, "We can hold out, devil. We'll last the day. Let the mob howl and let the power die, but we'll hold out. And when the news comesback that the Foundation has been taken, your precious mob will find uponwhat vacuum their religion has been built, and they'll desert your priestsand turn against them. I give you until noon tomorrow, Hardin, because youcan stop the power on Anacreon but you can't stop my fleet." His voicecroaked exultantly. "They're on their way, Hardin, with the great cruiser you yourself ordered repaired, at the head."</p>
<p>温尼斯嘶喊道：“你这魔鬼，我们能撑下去，我们一定撑得过今天。让暴民去吼吧，让电力中断吧，但我们会撑过去。等到基地被攻陷的消息传来，你那些伟大的群众就会发觉他们的宗教如何虚幻；他们将会背弃你的那些教士，并且反过来对付他们。哈定，我向你保证，你顶多得意到明天中午。你只能切断安纳克里昂的能源，却无法阻挡我的舰队。”他扯着沙哑的喉咙，耀武扬威地说：“哈定，舰队正朝着目标前进，由你下令修复的那艘巡弋舰率领。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin replied lightly. "Yes, the cruiser I myself ordered repaired--butin my own way. Tell me, Wienis, have you ever heard of a hyperwave relay? No, I see you haven't. Well, in about two minutes you'll find out what onecan do."</p>
<p>哈定轻松地答道：“没错，那艘巡弋舰是我下令修复的——却是照着我的意思修的。温尼斯，告诉我，你有没有听过超波中继器？喔，我看得出你没听过。好吧，大约两分钟内，你就能知道那个装置的妙用。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The televisor flashed to life as he spoke, and he amended, "No, in two seconds. Sit down, Wienis. and listen."</p>
<p>此时影像电话突然亮起来，于是他改口道：“不，两秒钟内。温尼斯，坐下来好好听着。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>3.7</p>
<p></p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Theo Aporat was one of the very highest ranking priests of Anacreon. Fromthe standpoint of precedence alone, he deserved his appointment as headpriest- attendant upon the flagship Wienis.</p>
<p>泰欧·艾波拉特是一名地位极高的安纳克里昂教士。单就辈分的考虑，他就被任命为旗舰温尼斯号上的首席随军教士。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>But it was not only rank or precedence. He knew the ship. He had workeddirectly under the holy men from the Foundation itself in repairing theship. He had gone over the motors under their orders. He had rewired the'visors; revamped the communications system; replated the punctured hull;reinforced the beams. He had even been permitted to help while the wise menof the Foundation had installed a device so holy it had never been placedin any previous ship, but had been reserved only for this magnificentcolossus of a vessel--a hyperwave relay.</p>
<p>但是除了地位与辈分的考虑之外，另一个重要原因是他十分熟悉这艘星舰。在它的修复过程中，他曾在基地圣者的直接指导下工作。根据他们的指挥，他调整发动机、重新连接影像电话的线路、翻修整个通讯系统、修补百孔千疮的舰身、补强舰体的结构。甚至当安装一个极为神圣的设备时，他也获准在旁帮忙。由于这个设备如此神圣，过去从来没有安装在任何一艘星舰上，它是专门保留给这艘伟大的星际战舰的——那就是“超波中继器”。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>It was no wonder that he felt heartsick over the purposes to which theglorious ship was perverted. He had never wanted to believe what Verisofhad told him-- that the ship was to be used for appalling wickedness; thatits guns were to be turned on the great Foundation. Turned on thatFoundation, where he had been trained as a youth, from which allblessedness was derived.</p>
<p>如今这艘神圣的星舰将用做不义之举，难怪他会感到极度痛心。维瑞索夫早已告诉过他，这艘星舰将要犯下骇人的邪恶罪行；它的炮口会转向伟大的基地，但他一直不愿意相信。基地，他年轻时就是在那里接受教士培训，而且所有的福泽都是源自基地。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Yet he could not doubt now, after what the admiral had told him.</p>
<p>可是听完舰队司令的一番话之后，他发觉事实已经不容置疑。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>How could the king, divinely blessed, allow this abominable act? Or was itthe king? Was it not, perhaps, an action of the accursed regent, Wienis,without the knowledge of the king at all. And it was the son of this sameWienis that was the admiral who five minutes before had told him:</p>
<p>神圣的国王怎能允许这种邪恶的行动呢？真是国王的意思吗？倘若不是，或许就是可恶的摄政王温尼斯假传圣旨，国王如今还被蒙在鼓里。而且，这个舰队的司令官正是温尼斯的儿子，就是他，在五分钟前告诉自己说：“教士，你只要负责看顾灵魂和认真祷告，我会照顾我的星舰。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Attend to your souls and your blessings, priest. I will attend to myship."Aporat smiled crookedly. He would attend to his souls and his blessings--and also to his cursings; and Prince Lefkin would whine soon enough.</p>
<p>艾波拉特露出诡异的笑容。他会看顾灵魂并且认真祷告，但他也要认真诅咒，而雷夫金王子很快就会痛哭流涕。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He had entered the general communications room now. His. acolyte precededhim and the two officers in charge made no move to interfere. The headpriest-attendant had the right of free entry anywhere on the ship.</p>
<p>现在他正走进总通讯室，由手下的助理教士在前面开道。执勤的两名军官并没有拦阻他们，因为首席随军教士有权进入星舰的任何角落。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Close the door," Aporat ordered, and looked at the chronometer. It lackedFive minutes of twelve. He had timed it well.</p>
<p>“把门关上。”艾波拉特命令道，然后看了看精密计时器。十二点差五分，他将时间算得很准。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>With quick practiced motions, he moved the little levers that opened allcommunications, so that every part of the two-mile-long ship was withinreach of his voice and his image.</p>
<p>他以迅速而熟练的动作，打开舰上所有的通讯系统。于是在这艘全长二英里的星舰上，任何一个角落都能听到他的声音、看到他的影像。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Soldiers of the royal flagship Wienis, attend! It is your priest-attendantthat speaks!" The sound of his voice reverberated, he knew, from the stematom blast in the extreme rear to the navigation tables in the prow.</p>
<p>“温尼斯号旗舰上全体官兵，请注意！这是你们的首席随军教士讲话！”他知道，自己的声音会立刻在星舰各处回响——从舰尾的核炮台，到舰首的领航台。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Your ship," he cried, "is engaged in sacrilege. Without your knowledge, itis performing such an act as will doom the soul of every man among you tothe eternal frigidity of space! Listen! It is the intention of yourcommander to take this ship to the Foundation and there to bombard thatsource of all blessings into submission to his sinful will. And since that is his intention, I, in the name of the Galactic Spirit, remove him from his command, for there is no command where the blessing of the Galactic Spirit has been withdrawn. The divine king himself may not maintain hiskingship without the consent of the Spirit."</p>
<p>“你们的星舰，”他喊道，“正在进行冒渎圣灵的罪行。在你们不知情的状况下，它的行动足以令你们的灵魂永远流放在冰冷的太空中！注意听！你们的指挥官，由于他心中罪恶的邪念，打算将这艘星舰驶往基地，轰炸并征服我们的万福之源。因为他的意图明显，我奉银河圣灵之名，现在解除他的指挥权。因为没有银河圣灵的庇佑，就没有指挥权的存在。甚至神圣的国王，若没有圣灵的认可，也将无法维持王位。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>His voice took on a deeper tone, while the acolyte listened with venerationand the two soldiers with mounting fear. "And because this ship is uponsuch a devil's errand, the blessing of the Spirit is removed from it aswell."</p>
<p>他的声音越来越低沉，助理教士以虔诚的心情恭敬聆听，一旁的两名军官则越听越恐惧。“由于这艘星舰进行如此邪恶的勾当，银河圣灵的庇佑也已经消失了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He lifted his arms solemnly, and before a thousand televisors throughout the ship, soldiers cowered, as the stately image of their priest-attendant spoke:</p>
<p>他庄严地举起双手，在舰上近千架影像电话前，官兵们怀着畏惧的心情，紧盯着首席随军教士威严的影像。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"In the name of the Galactic Spirit and of his prophet, Hari Seldon, and ofhis interpreters, the holy men of the Foundation, I curse this ship. Letthe televisors of this ship, which are its eyes, become blind. Let itsgrapples, which are its arms, be paralyzed. Let the nuclear blasts, whichare its fists, lose their function. Let the motors, which are its heart,cease to beat. Let the communications, which are its voice, become dumb. Let its ventilations, which are its breath, fade. Let its lights, which areits soul, shrivel into nothing. In the name of the Galactic Spirit, I socurse this ship."</p>
<p>“奉银河圣灵之名，奉先知哈里·谢顿之名，奉圣灵的仆人基地圣者之名，我诅咒这艘星舰。让它的眼睛——影像电话——全部瞎掉；让它的手臂——钩爪——通通瘫痪；让它的拳头——核炮——尽数失效；让它的心脏——发动机——停止搏动；让它的声音——通讯装置——喑哑无声；让它的呼吸器官——通风设备——奄奄一息；让它的灵魂——灯光——完全熄灭。奉银河圣灵之名，我如此诅咒这艘星舰。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And with his last word, at the stroke of midnight, a hand, light-yearsdistant in the Argolid Temple, opened an ultrawave relay, which at theinstantaneous speed of the ultrawave, opened another on the flagshipWienis.</p>
<p>当他说完的时候，恰好是午夜十二点。在几光年外的艾哥里德灵殿，正有一只手打开超波中继器的开关。在同一瞬间，它送出的超波开启了温尼斯号旗舰上的另一个中继器。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And the ship died!</p>
<p>整艘星舰完全停摆！</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>For it is the chief characteristic of the religion of science that itworks, and that such curses as that of Aporat's are really deadly.</p>
<p>这就是科学性宗教最主要的特征，一切真的能够应验，艾波拉特对这艘星舰的诅咒也不例外。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Aporat saw the darkness close down on the ship and heard the sudden ceasingof the soft, distant purring of the hyperatomic motors. He exulted and fromthe pocket of his long robe withdrew a self-powered nucleo-bulb that filledthe room with pearly light.</p>
<p>艾波拉特看到一片漆黑笼罩着这艘星舰，听到远方超核能发动机柔和的转动声突然停止。他感到非常高兴，便从法衣内取出自备电源的核灯泡，使室内充满珍珠般的光芒。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He looked down at the two soldiers who, brave men though they undoubtedlywere, writhed on their knees in the last extremity of mortal terror. "Saveour souls, your reverence. We are poor men, ignorant of the crimes of ourleaders," one whimpered.</p>
<p>他低头望向那两名军官，他们无疑是勇敢的军人，但是出于精神上的极度恐惧，两人竟然不由自主地跪下来。“上师，救救我们的灵魂吧。我们都是无辜的可怜人，对指挥官犯下的罪行毫不知情。”其中一个呜咽着说。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Follow," said Aporat, sternly. "Your soul is not yet lost."</p>
<p>“跟我来！”艾波拉特以严厉的口吻说，“你的灵魂尚未沉沦。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The ship was a turmoil of darkness in which fear was so thick and palpable,it was all but a miasmic smell. Soldiers crowded close wherever Aporat andhis circle of light passed, striving to touch the hem of his robe, pleadingfor the tiniest scrap of mercy.</p>
<p>整艘星舰在黑暗中陷入一片混乱，恐惧感就像是摸得着也闻得到的浓浓毒气。在艾波拉特与他的光圈经过之处，随时都有官兵蜂拥而上，拉着他的法衣边缘，请求他施舍一丝一毫的慈悲。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And always his answer was, "Follow me!"</p>
<p>而他的答案始终如一：“跟我来！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He found Prince Lefkin, groping his way through the officers' quarters,cursing loudly for lights. The admiral stared at the priest-attendant withhating eyes.</p>
<p>艾波拉特终于找到雷夫金王子，他正穿过军官寝室摸索过来，同时破口咒骂着黑暗。此时，这位司令官正恶狠狠地瞪着这位首席随军教士。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"There you are!" Lefkin inherited his blue eyes from his mother, but therewas that about the hook in his nose and the squint in his eye that markedhim as the son of Wienis. "What is the meaning of your treasonable actions? Return the power to the ship. I am commander here."</p>
<p>“你终于出现了！”王子的蓝眼睛来自母亲的遗传，但鹰勾鼻与斜眼标志着他是温尼斯的儿子。“你这种叛变的行为，究竟是什么意思？赶快恢复舰上的动力，我才是这里的指挥官。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"No longer," said Aporat, somberly.</p>
<p>“你不再是了。”艾波拉特寒着脸说。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lefkin looked about wildly. "Seize that man. Arrest him, or by Space, Iwill send every man within reach of my voice out the air lock in the nude."He paused, and then shrieked, "It is your admiral that orders. Arrest him."</p>
<p>雷夫金狂乱地四下张望。“抓住这个人，逮捕他。不然我向太空发誓，我会把你们这些抗命者通通抓起来，剥光衣服，从气闸丢到外太空去。”他顿了顿，又尖叫道：“这是你们的司令官在下令，快抓住他。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Then, as he lost his head entirely, "Are you allowing yourselves to befooled by this mountebank, this harlequin? Do you cringe before a religioncompounded of clouds and moonbeams? This man is an imposter and theGalactic Spirit he speaks of a fraud of the imagination devised to……"</p>
<p>最后，他完全丧失了理智。“你们愿意上这个骗子、这个小丑的当吗？你们何必害怕这种胡诌出来的宗教？这人是个冒牌货，他所说的银河圣灵，根本就是虚构的幌子，目的是要……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Aporat interrupted furiously. "Seize the blasphemer. You listen to him atthe peril of your souls."</p>
<p>艾波拉特愤怒地打断他的话。“拿下这个亵渎圣灵的人。听他说话，也会危及你们的灵魂。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And promptly, the noble admiral went down under the clutching hands of ascore of soldiers.</p>
<p>好几名官兵立刻一拥而上，紧紧抓住这位尊贵的司令官。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Take him with you and follow me.</p>
<p>“抓好他，跟我来。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Aporat turned, and with Lefkin dragged along after him, and the corridorsbehind black with soldiery, he returned to the communications room. There,he ordered the ex-commander before the one televisor that worked.</p>
<p>艾波拉特转身就走，雷夫金被押在后面紧跟着，走廊里黑压压地挤满了官兵。艾波拉特回到总通讯室，立即命令将“前任指挥官”带到一台未失灵的影像电话前。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Order the rest of the fleet to cease course and to prepare for the returnto Anacreon."</p>
<p>“命令舰队停止前进，准备返回安纳克里昂。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The disheveled Lefkin, bleeding, beaten, and half stunned, did so.</p>
<p>雷夫金被打得头破血流，衣衫褴褛，也吓得有些神志不清，当然只好遵命。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"And now," continued Aporat, grimly, "we are in contact with Anacreon onthe hyperwave beam. Speak as I order you."</p>
<p>“现在，”艾波拉特继续厉声道，“我们和安纳克里昂取得了超波联系，你照我的话来说。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lefkin made a gesture of negation, and the mob in the room and the otherscrowding the corridor beyond, growled fearfully.</p>
<p>雷夫金做了一个不愿意的手势，立刻引来周围所有官兵一阵可怖的怒吼。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Speak!" said Aporat. "Begin: The Anacreonian navy……"</p>
<p>“跟着我说！”艾波拉特道，“开始：安纳克里昂舰队……”</p></div>

<p>There was absolute silence in Wienis' chambers when the image of PrinceLefkin appeared at the televisor. There had been one startled gasp from theregent at the haggard face and shredded uniform of his son, and then hecollapsed into a chair, face contorted with surprise and apprehension.</p>
<p>当雷夫金王子的影像出现在电话中时，温尼斯的书房进入绝对的沉默。摄政王看见儿子憔悴的面容与撕烂的制服，惊吓得倒抽一口气，整个人瘫在椅子上。由于惊恐与焦虑，他的脸孔整个扭曲了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin listened stolidly, hands clasped lightly in his lap, while thejust-crowned King Lepold sat shriveled in the most shadowy comer, bitingspasmodically at his goldbraided sleeve. Even the soldiers had lost theemotionless stare that is the prerogative of the military, and, from wherethey lined up against the door, nuclear blasts ready, peered furtively atthe figure upon the televisor.</p>
<p>哈定双手轻握，搁在膝头，面无表情地听着影像电话传来的声音。刚刚加冕的列普德国王则蜷缩在最阴暗的角落，紧张兮兮地咬着镶金边的袖子。就连警卫也都不再板起职业军人的脸孔，他们在门边排成一列，手中握着核铳，眼睛却偷瞄着电话中的影像。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lefkin spoke, reluctantly, with a tired voice that paused at intervals asthough he were being prompted-and not gently:</p>
<p>雷夫金开始讲话，疲倦的声音听来万分不情愿。他讲得断断续续，好像有人不断在提词，而且对他很不客气。</p></div>

<p>"The Anacreonian navy ... aware of the nature of its mission ... andrefusing to be a party ... to abominable sacrilage ... is returning toAnacreon ... with the following ultimatum issued ... to those blasphemingsinners ... who would dare to use profane force ... against the Foundation... source of all blessings ... and against the Galactic Spirit.

<div class='layout'>
<p>The voice ended with half a sob and the screen went blank.</p>
<p>这段话以半声哭泣作为结束，荧幕上的影像就此消失。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin's fingers passed rapidly over the nucleo-bulb and its light fadeduntil in the dimness, the hitherto regent, the king, and the soldiers werehazy-edged shadows; and for the first time it could be seen that an auraencompassed Hardin.</p>
<p>哈定迅速按了一下核灯泡，光线逐渐暗下来，前摄政王、国王与警卫们都变成了朦胧的黑影。直到这时，才看得出哈定周身也有灵光围绕。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>It was not the blazing light that was the prerogative of kings, but oneless spectacular, less impressive, and yet one more effective in its ownway, and more useful.</p>
<p>它不像国王特有的灵光那样闪耀夺目，也没有那么壮观与显着，却更有效更实用。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin's voice was softly ironic as he addressed the same Wienis who hadone hour earlier declared him a prisoner of war and Terminus on the pointof destruction, and who now was a huddled shadow, broken and silent. "There is an old fable," said Hardin, "as old perhaps as humanity, for theoldest records containing it are merely copies of other records stillolder, that might interest you. It runs as follows:</p>
<p>一小时之前，温尼斯还得意洋洋地宣称哈定成了战俘，端点星则是即将被摧毁的目标。现在他却整个人瘫成一团，心灰意冷，默然不语。冲着这位温尼斯，哈定以稍带讽刺的语气说：“有一个非常古老的寓言故事，它可能和人类历史同样久远，因为已知最古老的记载，仍是抄自更为古老的版本。你可能会感兴趣，它是这么说的：</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"A horse having a wolf as a powerful and dangerous enemy lived in constantfear of his life. Being driven to desperation, it occured to him to seek astrong ally. Whereupon he approached a man, and offered an alliance,pointing out that the wolf was likewise an enemy of the man. The manaccepted the partnership at once and offered to kill the wolf immediately,if his new partner would only co-operate by placing his greater speed atthe man's disposal. The horse was willing, and allowed the man to placebridle and saddle upon him. The man mounted, hunted down the wolf, and killed him.</p>
<p>“从前有一匹马，它有一个危险而凶猛的敌人——狼，所以每天战战兢兢度日。在绝望之余，马突然想到要找一个强壮的盟友。于是它找到了人，它对人说狼也是人的大敌，提出和人结盟的建议。人毫不犹豫接受了，并说只要马能跟他合作，将快腿交给他指挥，他们可以立刻去杀掉狼。马答应了这个条件，允许人将马缰和马鞍装在它身上。于是人就骑着马去猎狼，把狼给杀死了。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"The horse, joyful and relieved, thanked the man, and said: 'Now that ourenemy is dead, remove your bridle and saddle and restore my freedom.'</p>
<p>“马高兴地松了一口气，它向人道谢，并说：‘现在我们的敌人死了，请你解开马缰和马鞍，还我自由吧。’</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Whereupon the man laughed loudly and replied, 'Never!' and applied the spurs with a will."</p>
<p>“人却纵声大笑，回答这匹马说：‘你休想！’还用马刺狠狠踢了它一下。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Silence still. The shadow that was Wienis did not stir.</p>
<p>室内仍是一片静寂。温尼斯的身影一动也没动。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin continued quietly, "You see the analogy, I hope. In their anxiety tocement forever domination over their own people, the kings of the FourKingdoms accepted the religion of science that made them divine; and thatsame religion of science was their bridle and saddle, for it placed thelife blood of nuclear power in the hands of the priesthoodwho took theirorders from us, be it noted, and not from you. You killed the wolf, but could not get rid of them……"</p>
<p>哈定继续轻声说：“我希望你听得懂这个比喻。为了巩固政权，以便永远统治人民，四王国的国王接受了神化自己的科学性宗教。这个宗教便成了他们的马缰和马鞍，因为它把核能的源头交到教士手中——请注意，那些教士听命于我们，而不是你们。你们杀死了狼，却再也无法摆脱……”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis sprang to his feet and in the shadows, his eyes were maddenedhollows. His voice was thick, incoherent. "And yet I'll get you. You won'tescape. You'll rot. Let them blow us up. Let them blow everything up. You'll rot! I'll get you!"</p>
<p>温尼斯突然从阴影中一跃而起，双眼像是两个狰狞的深洞。他声音混浊，说话语无伦次。“反正我要干掉你，你逃不掉的，你会死在这里。让他们把这里炸平吧，让他们炸毁一切吧。你会死在这里！我要干掉你！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Soldiers!" he thundered, hysterically. "Shoot me down that devil. Blasthim! Blast him!"</p>
<p>“卫兵！”他神经质地狂喝道，“替我把这个恶魔射死。射死他！射死他！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin turned about in his chair to face the soldiers and smiled. One aimedhis nuclear blast and then lowered it. The others never budged. SalvorHardin, mayor of Terminus, surrounded by that soft aura, smiling soconfidently, and before whom all the power of Anacreon had crumbled topowder was too much for them, despite the orders of the shrieking maniacjust beyond. </p>
<p>坐在椅子上的哈定转过头去，微笑着面对那些警卫。其中一人举起核铳要瞄准，却随即放下，其他人根本一动不动。在柔和的灵光中，端点星市长塞佛·哈定胸有成竹地微笑着。在他面前，安纳克里昂的一切力量都粉碎了。警卫们受不了这种莫名的压迫感，不再理会温尼斯疯狂嘶喊出的命令。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Wienis shouted incoherently and staggered to the nearest soldier. Wildly,he wrested the nuclear blast from the man's hand-aimed it at Hardin, whodidn't stir, shoved the lever and held it contacted.</p>
<p>温尼斯一面语无伦次地吼叫，一面蹒跚走向身旁一名警卫。他一把夺走警卫手中的核铳，立即瞄准泰然自若的哈定，然后重重扣下扳机。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The pale continous beam impinged upon the force-field that surrounded themayor of Terminus and was sucked harmlessly to neutralization. Wienis pressed harder and laughed tearingly.</p>
<p>朦胧的连续光束射向哈定市长，却在碰到他周围的力场后全被吸收中和。温尼斯发出疯狂的大笑，更加用力地扣下扳机。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin still smiled and his force-field aura scarcely brightened as itabsorbed the energies of the nuclear blast. From his comer Lepold coveredhis eyes and moaned.</p>
<p>哈定依然面带微笑，力场吸收了核铳的能量之后，只是微微发出一点光芒。列普德仍旧畏缩在角落里，捂着眼睛不停呻吟。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>And, with a yell of despair, Wienis changed his aim and shot again--andtoppled to the floor with his head blown into nothingness.</p>
<p>接着，温尼斯发出一声绝望的喊叫，将铳口转向，再度扣下扳机——他立时倒在地上，头部被轰得一点不剩。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin winced at the sight and muttered, "A man of 'direct action' to theend. The last refuge!"</p>
<p>哈定心中一凛，喃喃地说：“他真是个贯彻始终的直接路线派，这就是他最后的手段！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>3.9</p>
<p></p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The Time Vault was filled; filled far beyond the available seatingcapacity, and men lined the back of the room, three deep.</p>
<p>时光穹窿中挤满了人潮；除了座无虚席之外，后面还满满站了三排。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Salvor Hardin compared this large company with the few men attending thefirst appearance of Hari Seldon, thirty years earlier. There had only beensix, then; the five old Encyclopedists--all dead now--and himself, theyoung figurehead of a mayor. It had been on that day, that he, with YohanLee's assistance had removed the "figurehead" stigma from his office.</p>
<p>塞佛·哈定看到这么多人，不禁想起哈里·谢顿第一次出现时的冷清场面。那是三十年前的事，当时只有六个人在场；其中五位是年老的百科全书编者——现在都作古了，另一个人就是他自己，一位年轻的傀儡市长。也就是那一天，他在约翰·李的协助下发动政变，摘除了“傀儡”这个耻辱的头衔。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>It was quite different now; different in every respect. Every man of theCity Council was awaiting Seldon's appearance. He, himself, was stillmayor, but all-powerful now; and since the utter rout of Anacreon,all-popular. When he had returned from Anacreon with the news of the deathof Wienis, and the new treaty signed with the trembling Lepold, he wasgreeted with a vote of confidence of shrieking unanimity. When this wasfollowed in rapid order, by similar treaties signed with each of the otherthree kingdoms--treaties that gave the Foundation powers such as wouldforever prevent any attempts at attack similar to that of Anacreon's--torchlight processions had been held in every city street of Terminus. Noteven Hari Seldon's name had been more loudly cheered.</p>
<p>如今情况完全不同了，一切都不一样了。市议会中每位成员都在等待谢顿的出现。哈定自己仍是市长，但是早已大权在握；自从令安纳克里昂溃不成军之后，他更是深得民心。当他从安纳克里昂带回温尼斯的死讯，以及跟吓坏了的列普德新签的条约时，在欢声雷动中，他赢得市议会一致通过的信任投票。接着他又一鼓作气，迅速跟另外三个王国签订了类似的条约——基地据此所获得的权力，足以永久预防类似安纳克里昂这次的侵略企图。当这些条约签订时，端点星大街小巷都挤满了参加火炬游行的人群。就连哈里·谢顿的名字，也从来没有被人欢呼得如此响亮。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin's lips twitched. Such popularity had been his after the first crisisalso.</p>
<p>哈定撇了撇嘴。当年第一次危机过后，自己也是这么有声望。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Across the room, Sef Sermak and Lewis Bort were engaged in animateddiscussion, and recent events seemed to have put them out not at all. Theyhad joined in the vote of confidence; made speeches in which they publiclyadmitted that they had been in the wrong, apologized handsomely for the useof certain phrases in earlier debates, excused themselves delicately bydeclaring they had merely followed the dictates of their judgement andtheir conscience--and immediately launched a new Actionist campaign.</p>
<p>在穹窿的另一个角落，赛夫·瑟麦克与路易斯·玻特正在进行热烈讨论，最近这些事似乎一点也没有令他们气馁。他们照样参加信任投票，并且发表演说公开承认自己的错误，还漂亮地为以前的若干不当言词致歉。他们油腔滑调地为自己辩解，说他们的行为只是遵循判断与良知——然后行动党立刻展开了新的活动。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Yohan Lee touched Hardin's sleeve and pointed significantly to his watch.</p>
<p>约翰·李碰了碰哈定的袖子，若有深意地指指手表。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin looked up. "Hello there, Lee. Are you still sour? What's wrong now?"</p>
<p>哈定抬起头来。“嗨，约翰。你怎么还是这么忧心忡忡？又有什么问题？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"He's due in five minutes, isn't he?"</p>
<p>“五分钟后他就应该出现了，对不对？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I presume so. He appeared at noon last time."</p>
<p>“想必没错，上次他就是正午出现的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"What if he doesn't?"</p>
<p>“万一他不出现怎么办？”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"Are you going to wear me down with your worries all your life? If hedoesn't, he won't."</p>
<p>“你一辈子都要用自己担心的事来烦我吗？他不出现就算了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee frowned and shook his head slowly. "If this thing flops, we're inanother mess. Without Seldon's backing for what we've done, Sermak will befree to start all over. He wants outright annexation of the Four Kingdoms,and immediate expansion of the Foundation--by force, if necessary. He'sbegun his campaign, already."</p>
<p>约翰皱着眉，缓缓摇了摇头。“万一他不出现，我们又会有麻烦。没有谢顿为我们所做的事背书，瑟麦克会毫无顾忌地卷土重来。他想要彻底兼并四王国，立即扩张基地的版图——必要时不惜采取武力。他已经开始为这个主张活动了。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"I know. A fire eater must eat fire even if he has to kindle it himself. And you, Lee, have got to worry even if you must kill yourself to inventsomething to worry about."</p>
<p>“我知道。玩火者即使会因而自焚，也非得玩火不可。而你，约翰，却一定要千方百计自寻烦恼，牺牲生命在所不惜。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Lee would have answered, but he lost his breath at just that moment--asthe lights yellowed and went dim. He raised his arm to point to the glasscubicle that dominated half the room and then collapsed into a chair with awindy sigh.</p>
<p>约翰正准备回答，却突然喘不过气来，因为灯光在一瞬间开始转暗。他伸出手臂，指了指占穹窿一半面积的玻璃室，随即瘫坐在椅子上，并发出一声轻叹。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin himself straightened at the sight of the figure that now filled thecubicle-- a figure in a wheel chair! He alone, of all those present couldremember the day, decades ago, when that figure had appeared first. He hadbeen young then, and the figure old. Since then, the figure had not aged aday, but he himself had in turn grown old.</p>
<p>看见玻璃室中出现了影像，哈定不禁把身子挺直——那是一个坐在轮椅上的人！今天来到现场的众人，只有他知道几十年前，这个影像第一次出现时的情景。那时他还年轻，影像则是个老人。如今三十年过去了，这个影像毫无变化，哈定自己却垂垂老矣。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>The figure stared straight ahead, hands fingering a book in its lap.</p>
<p>影像凝望着正前方，双手抚弄着膝上的一本书。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>It said, "I am Hari Seldon!" The voice was old and soft.</p>
<p>它开始说话：“我是哈里·谢顿！”声音苍老而柔和。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>There was a breathless silence in the room and Hari Seldon continuedconversationally, "This is the second time I've been here. Of course, Idon't know if any of you were here the first time. In fact, I have no wayof telling, by sense perception, that there is anyone here at all, but thatdoesn't matter. If the second crisis has been overcome safely, you arebound to be here; there is no way out. If you are not here, then the secondcrisis has been too much for you."</p>
<p>穹窿中静得听不到呼吸声，哈里·谢顿继续流畅地说下去。“这是我第二次在此出现。当然，我不知道你们当中，是否有人第一次也在场。事实上，光凭感觉，我也无法判断现在有没有人在这里，不过这都没有关系。假如第二次危机已经安然度过，你们就一定会来这里，不可能有例外。倘若你们没有来，那就代表第二次危机不是你们所能应付的。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He smiled engagingly. "I doubt that, however, for my figures show aninety-eight point four percent probability there is to be no significantdeviation from the Plan in the first eighty years.</p>
<p>他露出动人的笑容。“然而我想不至于，因为我的计算显示，在最初八十年间，本计划不产生重大偏差的几率是98.４％。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"According to our calculations, you have now reached domination of the barbarian kingdoms immediately surrounding the Foundation. Just as in the first crisis you held them off by use of the Balance of Power, so in the second, you gained mastery by use of the Spiritual Power as against the Temporal.</p>
<p>“根据我们的计算，你们现在已能控制紧邻基地的几个野蛮王国。第一次危机时，你们是利用‘势力均衡’来防止他们入侵；而第二次，你们则是利用‘形而上的力量’击败‘形而下的力量’。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"However, I might warn you here against overconfidence. It is not my way togrant you any foreknowledge in these recordings, but it would be safe toindicate that what you have now achieved is merely a new balance-though onein which your position is considerably better. The Spiritual Power, whilesufficient to ward off attacks of the Temporal is not sufficient to attackin turn. Because of the invariable growth of the counteracting force knownas Regionalism, or Nationalism, the Spiritual Power cannot prevail. I am telling you nothing new, I'm sure.</p>
<p>“然而，我要在这里警告各位，不要过于自信。在这些录像中，我并不想让你们预知任何未来的发展，但我不妨指出，你们现在所获得的只是一个新的平衡——不过你们的处境已经比以前好得多了。‘形而上的力量’虽然足以抵挡‘形而下的力量’所发动的攻击，却不足以反过来主动出击。由于地方主义或国家主义等等阻力必然不断成长，‘形而上的力量’无法永远保持优势。我相信，我所说的只是老生常谈。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"You must pardon me, by the way, for speaking to you in this vague way. Theterms I use are at best mere approximations, but none of you is qualifiedto understand the true symbology of psychohistory, and so I must do the best I can.</p>
<p>“对了，你们一定要原谅我说得这么含糊。我现在所用的语汇，顶多只是近似的叙述。但是各位都不了解心理史学的术语和符号，所以我只能尽量用普通的语言解释。</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>"In this case, the Foundation is only at the start of the path that leadsto the Second Galactic Empire. The neighboring kingdoms, in manpower andresources are still overwhelmingly powerful as compared to yourselves. Outside them lies the vast tangled jungle of barbarism that extends aroundthe entire breadth of the Galaxy. Within that rim there is still what isleft of the Galactic Empire--and that, weakened and decaying though it is,is still incomparably mighty."</p>
<p>“目前，基地只是来到通往‘第二银河帝国’之路的起点。邻近的诸王国，在人力及资源方面，仍旧胜过你们无数倍。在这些王国外面，是蔓延整个银河的浑沌蛮荒丛林。而在银河的内圈，还有银河帝国的残躯——虽然不断地衰败，势力仍然强大无匹。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>At this point, Hari Seldon lifted his book and opened it. His face grewsolemn. "And never forget there was another Foundation established eightyyears ago; a Foundation at the other end of the Galaxy, at Star's End. Theywill always be there for consideration. Gentlemen, nine hundred and twentyyears of the Plan stretch ahead of you. The problem is yours!"</p>
<p>说到这里，哈里·谢顿捧起书本打开来，面容转趋庄严。“你们也绝对不能忘记，八十年前，我们还建立了另一个基地；它在银河的另一端，在‘群星的尽头’。你们一刻都不能忽视它的存在。各位，在你们面前展开的，是为期九百二十年的计划。端看各位如何面对了！”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>He dropped his eyes to his book and flicked out of existence, while thelights brightened to fullness. In the babble that followed, Lee leaned overto Hardin's ear. "He didn't say when he'd be back."</p>
<p>他将目光垂到书本上，随即消失无踪，室内立刻恢复原来的光亮。在随之而来的一阵嘈杂声中，约翰附在哈定耳旁说：“他没有说什么时候再回来。”</p></div>

<div class='layout'>
<p>Hardin replied, "I know--but I trust he won't return until you and I aresafely and cozily dead!"</p>
<p>哈定答道：“我知道——但是我相信，在你我寿终正寝之前，他绝不会再回来了！”</p></div>
