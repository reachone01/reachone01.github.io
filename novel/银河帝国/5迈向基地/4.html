<div class='layout'><p>PART IV WANDA SELDON</p><p>第四部 婉达·谢顿</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>SELDON·WANDA:……In the waning years of Hari Seldon's life, he grew most attached to (some say dependent upon) his granddaughter, Wanda. Orphaned in her teens, Wanda Seldon devoted herself to her grandfather's Psychohistory Project, filling the vacancy left by Yugo Amaryl…….</p><p>婉达·谢顿：在哈里·谢顿的暮年，他变得最为怜爱（也有人说是依赖）他的孙女婉达。十几岁痛失双亲后，婉达·谢顿便献身于其祖父的心理史学计划，填补了雨果·阿马瑞尔留下的空白……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The content of Wanda Seldon's work remains largely a mystery, for it was conducted in virtually total isolation. The only individuals allowed access to Wanda Seldon's research were Hari himself and a young man named Stettin Palver (whose descendant Preem would four hundred years later contribute to the rebirth of Trantor, as the planet rose from the ashes of the Great Sack [300 F.E.1).</p><p>婉达·谢顿的研究内容至今大多仍然是谜，因为它几乎都在完全隔绝的环境中进行。得以与婉达·谢顿研究工作接触的人，只有谢顿自己以及一位名叫史铁亭·帕佛的青年（四百年后，他的后裔普芮姆对川陀的重生做出重大贡献，当时这颗行星正从大浩劫的灰烬中站起来〔基地纪元300年〕）……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Although the full extent of Wanda Seldon's contribution to the Foundation is unknown, it was undoubtedly of the greatest magnitude…….</p><p>虽不清楚婉达·谢顿对基地的贡献到了什么程度，但毋庸置疑，其重要性无与伦比……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p><p>——《银河百科全书》</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>1</p><p>1</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon walked into the Galactic Library (limping a little, as he did more and more often these days) and made for the banks of skitters, the little vehicles that slid their way along the interminable corridors of the building complex.</p><p>哈里·谢顿走进帝国图书馆（脚步有点跛，最近这个毛病越来越常犯），朝一排贴地滑车的方向走去。在图书馆建筑群无边无际的回廊中，这种小型交通工具能够通行无阻。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was held up, however, by the sight of three men seated at one of the galactography alcoves, with the Galactograph showing the Galaxy in full three-dimensional representation and, of course, its worlds slowly pinwheeling around its core, spinning at right angles to that as well.</p><p>然而，坐在某间银河地理凹室的三个人吸引了他的注意。那里的三维银河舆图表现出银河系的完整风貌，此外，当然，每个世界都缓缓绕着星系核心旋转，同时还进行着转轴与前者垂直的自转。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From where Seldon stood he could see that the border Province of Anacreon was marked off in glowing red It skirted the edge of the Galaxy and took up a great volume, but it was sparsely populated with stars. Anacreon was not remarkable for either wealth or culture but was remarkable for its distance from Trantor: ten thousand parsecs away.</p><p>从谢顿所站的位置，他能看见边境星省安纳克里昂以鲜艳的红光标示出来。它位于银河的边缘，占有广大的范围，但其中的恒星相当稀疏。安纳克里昂的不凡之处既不在财富也不在文化，而在于它与川陀的距离：足有一万秒差距之远。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon acting on impulse, took a seat at a computer console near the three and set up a random search he was sure would take an indefinite period Some instinct told him that such an intense interest in Anacreon must be political in nature-its position in the Galaxy made it one of the least secure holdings of the current Imperial regime. His eyes remained on his screen, but Seldon's ears were open for the discussion near him. One didn't usually hear political discussions in the Library. They were, in point of fact, not supposed to take place.</p><p>谢顿一时兴起，在三人附近的一个电脑操作台前坐下，随便打了一个搜寻指令，心里明白得花上无数时间才能找到答案。某种直觉告诉他，他们一定是出于政治因素，才会对安纳克里昂有这么强烈的兴趣——它在银河中的位置，使它成为当今帝国政权最不保险的领域之一。谢顿的眼睛盯着自己的屏幕，但耳朵则听着身旁的讨论。图书馆里通常很少会听到有人谈论政治，事实上，根本就不该做这种讨论。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon did not know any of the three men. That was not entirely surprising. There were habitues of the Library, quite a few, and Seldon knew most of them by sight-and some even to talk to-but the Library was open to all citizens. No qualifications. Anyone could enter and use its facilities. (For a limited period of time, of course. Only a select few, like Seldon were allowed to "set up shop" in the Library. Seldon had I1uen granted the use of a locked private office and complete access to Library resources.)</p><p>谢顿不认识这三个人，这没有什么好奇怪的。帝国图书馆的确有些常客，而且还真不少，大多数谢顿都认得出来，甚至还跟其中一些讲过话。但这座图书馆对所有的公民开放，并没有资格限制，任何人都能进来使用其中的设备。当然是在限定的时间内。只有精挑细选的少数人，例如谢顿自己，才会获准“长驻”馆内。谢顿在此拥有一间上锁的个人研究室，而且得以动用该馆的一切资源。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One of the men (Seldon thought of him as Hook Nose, for obvious reasons) spoke in a low urgent voice.</p><p>其中一人（谢顿将他想成“鹰勾鼻”，理由很明显）正激昂地低声发表意见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Let it go," he said "Let it go It's costing us a mint to try to hold on and, even if we do, it will only be while they're there. They can't stay there forever and, as soon as they leave, the situation will revert to what it was."</p><p>“让它去吧，”他说：“让它去吧。试图维系它，将花费我们巨大的人力物力，而且即使那样做，也唯有他们待在那里才有效。他们不能永远待在那里，一旦他们离开，情势便会立刻回到原点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon knew what they were talking about. The news had come over TrantorVision only three days ago that the Imperial government had decided on a show of force to bring the obstreperous Governor of Anacreon into line. Seldon's own psychohistorical analysis had shown him that it was a useless procedure, but the government did not generally listen when its emotions were stirred Seldon smiled slightly and grimly at hearing Hook Nose say what he himself had said-and the young man said it without the benefit of any knowledge of psychohistory.</p><p>谢顿知道他们在谈论什么。三天前，川陀全视才报道了这则新闻，说帝国政府已决定展示一次武力，好让桀骜不驯的安纳克里昂总督乖乖合作。谢顿自己的心理史学分析早就告诉他，这样做注定徒劳无功，但政府一旦闹起情绪，通常是不会接受任何劝告的。谢顿听着鹰勾鼻说着自己说过的话，不禁露出淡淡的、严肃的微笑。这年轻人没有心理史学知识的指引，竟然就能说出这番话来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hook Nose went on. "If we leave Anacreon alone, what do we lose? It's still there, right where it always was, right at the edge of the Empire. It can't pick up and go to Andromeda, can it? So it still has to trade with us and life continues. What's the difference if they salute the Emperor or not? You'll never be able to tell the difference."</p><p>鹰勾鼻继续说：“如果不理会安纳克里昂，我们又失去了什么？它仍会在那里，仍在原来的地方，仍在帝国的边缘。它不会长了脚跑到仙女座星系去，对不对？所以说，它还是得和我们贸易，日子会继续过下去。他们是否向皇帝敬礼又有什么差别？你永远无法看出其中的差别。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The second man, whom Seldon had labeled Baldy, for even more obvious reasons, said, "Except this whole business doesn't exist in a vacuum. If Anacreon goes, the other border provinces will go. The Empire will break up."</p><p>谢顿心中将第二个人命名为“秃子”，理由甚至更明显。这时秃子说：“只不过整件事并非孤立于真空中。如果安纳克里昂走了，其他的边境星省也会跟着走，帝国就会四分五裂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So what?" whispered Hook Nose fiercely. "The Empire can't run itself effectively anymore, anyway. It's too big. Let the border go and take care of itself-if it can. The Inner Worlds will be all the stronger and better off. The border doesn't have to be ours politically; it will still be ours economically."</p><p>“那又怎样？”鹰勾鼻激愤地悄声道，“反正，帝国再也无法有效地自我管理，它太大了。让边境脱离，自求多福——但愿它做得到。这样一来，内围世界反倒会更强大，而且情况会更好。边境不必是我们的政治领域，但仍然会是我们的经济领域。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now the third man (Red Cheeks) said, "I wish you were right, but that's not the way it's going to work. If the border provinces establish their independence, the first thing each will do will be to try to increase its power at the expense of its neighbors. There'll be war and conflict and every one of the governors will dream of becoming Emperor at last. It will be like the old days before the Kingdom of Trantor-a dark age that will last for thousands of years."</p><p>此时，第三个人（“红面颊”）说：“我希望你说得对，可是这样行不通。如果边境星省都争取到独立，每个星省会做的第一件事，便是掠夺邻邦以扩充自己的实力。战争和冲突将接连不断，最后每位总督都会梦想当皇帝。那将会像川陀王国崛起前的那段日子，会出现延续好几千年的黑暗时期。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Baldy said, "Surely things won't be that bad. The Empire may break up, but it will heal itself quickly when people find out that the breakup just means war and impoverishment. They'll look back on the golden days of the intact Empire and all will be well again. We're not barbarians, you know. We'll find a way."</p><p>秃子说：“情况当然不会那么坏。帝国有可能分裂，但人民一旦发现分裂只意味着战争和贫困，帝国便会迅速自我愈合。人们会怀念一统帝国曾经拥有的黄金岁月，一切都会否极泰来。你也知道，我们不是蛮人，我们会找到一条出路。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Absolutely," said Hook Nose. "We've got to remember that the Empire has faced crisis after crisis in its history and has pulled through time and again."</p><p>“正是如此。”鹰勾鼻说，“我们一定要记得，在过去的历史上，帝国曾经面对一个接一个的危机，而且一次又一次冲破了难关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Red Cheeks shook his head as he said, "This is not just another crisis. This is something much worse. The Empire has been deteriorating for generations. Ten years' worth of the junta destroyed the economy and since the fall of the junta and the rise of this new Emperor, the Empire has been so weak that the governors on the Periphery don't have to do anything. It's going to fall of its own weight."</p><p>但红面颊一面摇头一面说：“这不只是另一次危机，这是糟得多的一件事。帝国已经衰落了好几代，执政团的十年统治又摧毁了经济。自从执政团垮台、新皇帝即位以来，帝国一直十分疲弱。银河外缘的总督们什么也不必做，帝国即将被自己的重量压垮。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And the allegiance to the Emperor……" began Hook Nose.</p><p>“对皇帝的忠诚……”鹰勾鼻说了半句便被打断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What allegiance?" said Red Cheeks. "We went for years without an Emperor after Cleon was assassinated and no one seemed to mind much. And this new Emperor is just a figurehead. There's nothing he can do. There's nothing anyone can do. This isn't a crisis. This is the end. "</p><p>“什么忠诚？”红面颊说，“克里昂遇刺后，我们有好多年没一个皇帝，但人人似乎都不怎么在意。而这个新皇帝只是个摆饰，没有什么事是他能做的，没有什么事是任何人能做的。这不是另一次危机，而是帝国的终结。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other two stared at Red Cheeks, frowning. Baldy said, "You really believe it! You think that the Imperial government will just sit there and let it all happen?"</p><p>另外两人瞪着红面颊，双双皱起眉头。秃子说：“你真相信吗！你以为帝国政府只会坐在那里，让这一切发生吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes! Like you two, they won't believe it is happening. That is, until it's too late."</p><p>“是的！像你们两个一样，他们不会相信一切正在发生。我是说，等到相信已经太迟了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What would you want them to do if they did believe it?" asked Baldy.</p><p>“假使他们相信，你又会要他们怎么做？”秃子问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Red Cheeks stared into the Galactograph, as if he might find an answer there. "I don't know. Look, in due course of time I'll die; things won't be too bad by then. Afterward, as the situation gets worse, other people can worry about it. I'll be gone. And so will the good old days. Maybe forever. I'm not the only one who thinks this, by the way. Ever hear of someone named Hari Seldon?"</p><p>红面颊凝视着银河舆图，仿佛可能从那里找到答案。“我不知道。听着，总有一天我会死去，那时情况还不会太糟。然后，当事态越来越糟之际，自会有其他人操心。不只我自己，过去的美好岁月也会消失，或许从此一去不返。对了，不只我一个人这么想，听过一个叫哈里·谢顿的人吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure," said Hook Nose at once. "Wasn't he First Minister under Cleon?"</p><p>“当然，”鹰勾鼻立刻说，“他不就是克里昂的首相吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said Red Cheeks. "He's some sort of scientist. I heard him give a talk a few months back. It felt good to know I'm not the only one who believes the Empire is falling apart. He said……"</p><p>“没错，”红面颊说，“他是某种科学家。几个月前，我听过他的一场演讲。能知道不只我一个人相信帝国正在分裂，这种感觉真好。他说……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And he said everything's going to pot and there's going to be a permanent dark age?" Baldy interjected.</p><p>“他说一切都会没落，永久的黑暗时期即将来临？”秃子突然插嘴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well no," said Red Cheeks. "He's one of these real cautious types. Ire says it might happen, but he's wrong. It will happen."</p><p>“喔不是，”红面颊说，“他属于那种真正谨慎的类型，他说这有可能发生。可是他错了，这必将发生。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon had heard enough. He limped toward the table where the three men sat and touched Red Cheeks on the shoulder.</p><p>谢顿听得够多了。他跛着脚，朝三人围坐的桌子走去，碰了碰红面颊的肩膀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sir," he said, "may I speak to you for a moment?"</p><p>“先生，”他说，“我能和你谈一会儿吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Startled, Red Cheeks looked up and then he said, "Hey, aren't you Professor Seldon?"</p><p>红面颊吓了一跳，他抬起头来，然后说：“嘿，您不就是谢顿教授吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I always have been," said Seldon. He handed the man a reference tile bearing his photograph. "I would like to see you here in my Library office at 4 P.m., day after tomorrow. Can you manage that?"</p><p>“我一直都是。”谢顿说完，递给那人一块印着他本人相片的识别瓷卡，“后天下午四点钟，我希望在这座图书馆中我的研究室里和你见面。你能赴约吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have to work."</p><p>“我得工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Call in sick if you have to. It's important."</p><p>“有必要就请个病假，这事很重要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, I'm not sure, sir."</p><p>“这个嘛，教授，我不敢确定。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do it," said Seldon. "If you get into any sort of trouble over it, I'll straighten it out. And meanwhile, gentlemen, do you mind if I study the Galaxy simulation for a moment? It's been a long time since I've looked at one."</p><p>“就这么做。”谢顿说，“如果你因此惹上任何麻烦，我都会帮你摆平。现在，诸位先生，介不介意我研究一下这个银河拟像？我好久没看过这种东西了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They nodded mutely, apparently abashed at being in the presence of a former First Minister. One by one the men stepped back and allowed Seldon access to the Galactograph controls.</p><p>他们默默点了点头，面对一位前首相，他们显然有点不知所措。三人一一向后退去，让谢顿来到银河舆图控制台前。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon's finger reached out to the controls and the red that had marked off the Province of Anacreon vanished. The Galaxy was unmarked, a glowing pinwheel of mist brightening into the spherical glow at the center, behind which was the Galactic black hole.</p><p>谢顿以食指伸向控制台，标示着安纳克里昂星省的红色随即消失。现在这个银河不再有任何标示，只是一团漩涡状的光雾，越接近中心光球处越为明亮，正中心则是所谓的银河黑洞。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Individual stars could not be made out, of course, unless the view were magnified, but then only one portion or another of the Galaxy would be shown on the screen and Seldon wanted to see the whole thing -to get a look at the Empire that was vanishing.</p><p>当然，除非将影像放大，否则无法分辨个别的恒星，但那样却只能让银河的某一部分呈现在屏幕上，而谢顿想要看的则是全貌——看看正在消失中的帝国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He pushed a contact and a series of yellow dots appeared on the Galactic image. They represented the habitable planets-twenty-five million of them. They could be distinguished as individual dots in the thin fog that represented the outskirts of the Galaxy, but they were more and more thickly placed as one moved in toward the center. There was a belt of what seemed solid yellow (but which would separate into individual dots under magnification) around the central glow. The central glow itself remained white and unmarked, of course. No habitable planets could exist in the midst of the turbulent energies of the core.</p><p>他按下一个开关，银河影像中便出现一系列的黄色光点。它们代表可住人行星，共有二千五百万颗。在代表银河边缘的薄雾中，分得清它们是一个个光点，但越向中心走去，它们的分布便越来越密。在中心光球周围，有个近乎连续的黄色带状区域（但在放大后，仍会分成个别的黄色光点）。当然，中心光球本身仍是白色，其中没有任何标志。在银河核心的汹涌能浪正中央，不会有任何可住人行星存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Despite the great density of yellow, not one star in ten thousand, Seldon knew, had a habitable planet circling it. This was true, despite the planet-molding and terraforming capacities of humanity. Not all the molding in the Galaxy could make most of the worlds into anything a human being could walk on in comfort and without the protection of a spacesuit.</p><p>谢顿知道，尽管黄色的密度这么大，但在一万颗恒星中，拥有可住人行星的还不到一颗。虽然人类拥有行星塑造与大地改造的能力，上述事实依然成立。即使集中全银河的力量，大多数世界也无法被塑造成能让人类无需太空衣便能舒适地行走其上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon closed another contact. The yellow dots disappeared, but one tiny region glowed blue: Trantor and the various worlds directly dependent on it. As close as it could be to the central core and yet remaining insulated from its deadliness, it was commonly viewed as being located at the "center of the Galaxy," which it wasn't-not truly. As usual, one had to be impressed by the smallness of the world of Trantor, a tiny place in the vast realm of the Galaxy, but within it was squeezed the largest concentration of wealth, culture, and governmental authority that humanity had ever seen.</p><p>谢顿按下另一个开关。黄色光点不见了，但有一个微小区域亮起蓝光，那是川陀以及直属于它的各个世界。在不受致命威胁的前提下，川陀已尽可能接近中央核心。因此，它通常被视为位于“银河中心”，但这并不算完全正确。照例，人人都会对川陀世界的微小留下深刻印象。在广大浩瀚的银河中，它是那么小的一块，但其上所挤满的财富、文化与政府权威，其密度却又是人类前所未见的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And even that was doomed to destruction.</p><p>即使是这样，它仍注定毁灭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was almost as though the men could read his mind or perhaps they interpreted the sad expression on his face.</p><p>那三个人几乎像是能透视他的心灵，或者，也许是他们看懂了他脸上的悲哀神情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Baldy asked softly, "Is the Empire really going to be destroyed?"</p><p>秃子轻声问道：“帝国真的即将毁灭吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon replied, softer still, "It might. It might. Anything might happen."</p><p>谢顿以更轻的声音回答：“有可能，有可能，任何事都有可能发生。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He rose, smiled at the men, and left, but in his thoughts he screamed: It will! It will!</p><p>他站了起来，对三人笑了笑，便径自离去。但在他心中，他却声嘶力竭地高喊：一定会！一定会！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>2</p><p>2</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sighed as he climbed into one of the skitters that were ranked side by side in the large alcove. There had been a time, just a few years ago, when he had gloried in walking briskly along the interminable corridors of the Library, telling himself that even though he was past sixty he could manage it.</p><p>贴地滑车一辆接一辆排在一间大型凹室，谢顿一面爬进其中一辆，一面叹了一口气。曾有一段时间，就在几年前，他还意气风发地踏着轻快步伐走过图书馆无边无际的回廊，并且对自己说，虽然他已年过六十，却依然身强体健。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But now, at seventy, his legs gave way all too quickly and he had to take a skitter. Younger men took them all the time because skitters saved them trouble, but Seldon did it because he had to-and that made all the difference.</p><p>可是现在，他七十岁了，他的双腿迫不及待地老朽，使他不得不乘坐贴地滑车。虽然年纪较轻的人也总是利用这种交通工具，因为贴地滑车既省时又省力，但谢顿则是不得不这样做，其中的感觉就大不相同。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After Seldon punched in the destination, he closed a contact and the skitter lifted a fraction of an inch above the floor. Off it went at a rather casual pace, very smoothly, very silently, and Seldon leaned back and watched the corridor walls, the other skitters, the occasional walkers.</p><p>谢顿键入目的地，再按下一个开关，滑车便在地板上浮起少许。它以不急不徐的步调前进，非常平稳，非常安静。谢顿靠在座椅上，望着两旁的回廊墙壁、其他的贴地滑车，以及偶尔出现的步行者。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He passed a number of Librarians and, even after all these years, he still smiled when he saw them. They were the oldest Guild in the Empire, the one with the most revered traditions, and they clung to ways that were more appropriate centuries before-maybe millennia before.</p><p>他超过了好些图书馆员，即使过了这么多年，他看到他们时还是会莞尔一笑。他们属于帝国最古老的公会，拥有最虔敬的传统，而他们所墨守的行事方式，则较适合数世纪前，甚或数千年前的时代。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Their garments were silky and off-white and were loose enough to be almost gownlike, coming together at the neck and billowing out from there.</p><p>他们穿着白灰色的丝质服装，其松垮程度接近长袍。这种服装仅仅在颈部束紧，颈部以下则自由奔放。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trantor, like all the worlds, oscillated, where the males were concerned, between facial hair and smoothness. The people of Trantor itself -or at least most of its sectors-were smooth-shaven and had been smooth-shaven for as far back as he knew-excepting such anomalies as the mustaches worn by Dahlites, such as his own foster son, Raych.</p><p>就男性容貌而言，川陀与所有的世界一样，是在剃留胡须的两极之间摆荡。如今，川陀本地的男性（至少大多数区的男性）脸上都刮得干干净净，而且据他所知向来如此。只有一些例外的情形，像达尔男性便一律留八字胡，他自己的养子芮奇便是现成的例子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Librarians, however, clung to the beards of long ago. Every Librarian had a rather short neatly cultivated beard running from ear to ear but leaving bare the upper lip. That alone was enough to mark them for what they were and to make the smooth-shaven Seldon feel a little uncomfortable when surrounded by a crowd of them.</p><p>然而，这些图书馆员却留着古代的络腮胡。每位馆员的两耳之间，都布满相当短且修剪得整整齐齐的胡须，但上唇却一律裸露。光是这一点，就足以标示出他们的身份，并使得面部光洁的谢顿置身其间有点不自在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Actually the most characteristic thing of all was the cap each wore (perhaps even when asleep, Seldon thought). Square, it was made of a velvety material, in four parts that came together with a button at the top. The caps came in an endless variety of colors and apparently each color had significance. If you were familiar with Librarian lore, you could tell a particular Librarian's length of service, area of expertise, grades of accomplishment, and so on. They helped fix a pecking order. Every Librarian could, by a glance at another's hat, tell whether to be respectful (and to what degree) or overbearing (and to what degree).</p><p>其实，他们最具特色的一点是人人戴着的帽子（说不定连睡觉都不脱，谢顿这么想）。这种方帽以类似天鹅绒的质料制成，四面聚合于顶端，由一个扣子固定。它们的颜色五花八门，变化无穷，显然各有各的意义。假如你熟悉图书馆员的圈内文化，你就能根据帽子的颜色，判断某位图书馆员的年资、专长领域、成就的高低等等。它们有助于建立一个阶级秩序，每位馆员只要瞥一眼对方的帽子，便能判断是否应该恭敬以对（以及要做到什么程度），或是对方得对自己恭敬（以及到什么程度）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Galactic Library was the largest single structure on Trantor (possibly in the Galaxy), much larger than even the Imperial Palace, and it had once gleamed and glittered, as though boasting of its size and magnificence. However, like the Empire itself, it had faded and withered. It was like an old dowager still wearing the jewels of her youth but upon a body that was wrinkled and wattled.</p><p>帝国图书馆是川陀上最大的一座单一建筑（或许整个银河也无出其右），甚至远比皇宫巨大。它曾一度金碧辉煌，仿佛夸耀着它的堂皇与壮伟。然而，正如帝国本身一样，它已经开始凋零枯萎。就像一名年老的贵妇，虽然依旧戴着年轻时的珠宝，全身却已布满皱纹与赘肉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The skitter stopped in front of the ornate doorway of the Chief Librarian's office and Seldon climbed out.</p><p>贴地滑车在图书馆长办公室的华丽门口停下，谢顿随即走出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Las Zenow smiled as he greeted Seldon. "Welcome, my friend," he said in his high-pitched voice. (Seldon wondered if he had ever sung tenor in his younger days but had never dared to ask. The Chief Librarian was a compound of dignity always and the question might have seemed offensive.)</p><p>拉斯·齐诺面带笑容地迎接谢顿。“欢迎，我的朋友。”他以尖锐的声音说。谢顿好奇他年轻时是否唱过男高音，却从来不敢问。图书馆长始终是个威严的综合体，这个问题可能会显得无礼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Greetings," said Seldon. Zenow had a gray beard, rather more than halfway to white, and he wore a pure white hat. Seldon understood that without any explanation. It was a case of reverse ostentation. The total absence of color represented the highest peak of position.</p><p>“你好。”谢顿说。齐诺有一把灰色的络腮胡，已经白了七八分，他头上则戴着一顶白色的帽子。谢顿了解其中的玄机，根本无需任何解释。这是一种反其道而行的炫耀，完全没有颜色反倒代表位居顶峰。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow rubbed his hands with what seemed to be an inner glee. "I've called you in, Hari, because I've got good news for you. -We've found it!</p><p>齐诺搓了搓手，似乎内心充满欢喜。“我把你请来，哈里，是因为我有个好消息告诉你。我们找到了！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"By `it,' Las, you mean……"</p><p>“所谓的‘找到’，拉斯，你是指……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A suitable world. You wanted one far out. I think we've located the ideal one." His smile broadened. "You just leave it to the Library. Hari. We can find anything."</p><p>“一个合适的世界。你要一个遥远的世界，我想我们已经找到一个最理想的。”他的笑容变得更灿烂，“你只要把问题交给本馆，哈里，我们就能找出答案来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have no doubt, Las. Tell me about this world."</p><p>“我毫不怀疑，拉斯，跟我说说这个世界吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, let me show you its location first." A section of the wall slid aside, the lights in the room dimmed, and the Galaxy appeared in three-dimensional form, turning slowly. Again, red lines marked off the Province of Anacreon, so that Seldon could almost swear that the episode with the three men had been a rehearsal for this.</p><p>“好，我先让你看看它的位置。”墙壁的一部分滑向一侧，室内的光线暗了下来，银河则以三维影像呈现他们眼前，并且缓缓地旋转。红色线条再度标示出安纳克里昂星省，因此谢顿几乎可以发誓，刚才那段插曲正是现在的预演。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then a brilliant blue dot appeared at the far end of the province. "There it is," said Zenow. "It's an ideal world. Sizable, well-watered, good oxygen atmosphere, vegetation, of course. A great deal of sea life. It's there just for the taking. No planet-molding or terraforming required -or, at least, none that cannot be done while it is actually occupied."</p><p>然后，该星省的远端出现一个明亮的蓝色光点。“它就在那里。”齐诺说，“它是个理想的世界，大小适中，水量充沛，富氧的大气层，植物当然少不了。此外，上面还有好些海洋生物。它就在那里等人进驻，无需做任何行星塑造或大地改造。或者可以这么说，没什么是不能在实际住人后再进行的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Is it an unoccupied world, Las?"</p><p>谢顿问：“它是个未住人的世界吗，拉斯？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Absolutely unoccupied. No one on it."</p><p>“绝对未住人，没有一个人在上面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But why-if it's so suitable? I presume that, if you have all the details about it, it must have been explored. Why wasn't it colonized?"</p><p>“可是为什么呢，如果它这么合适？既然你拥有它的详细资料，据我推想，一定有人做过探勘。为什么没有人殖民呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was explored, but only by unmanned probes. And there was no colonization-presumably because it was so far from everything. The planet revolves around a star that is farther from the central black hole than that of any inhabited planet-farther by far. Too far, I suppose, for prospective colonists, but I think not too far for you. You said, `The farther, the better.' "</p><p>“是做过探勘，但只有无人探测器做过。的确没有被殖民，想必是因为它距离一切都太远了。这颗行星和中心黑洞的距离，要比任何住人行星更遥远，而且远得多。我猜，对于任何准备殖民的人而言，它都嫌太远了。但我想对你却不算太远，你曾经说‘越远越好’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said Seldon, nodding. "I still say so. Does it have a name or is there just a letter-number combination?"</p><p>“没错，”谢顿一面说一面点头，“现在我还是这么说。它有名字吗？或是只有字母和数字的编号？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Believe it or not, it has a name. Those who sent out the probes named it Terminus, an archaic word meaning `the end of the line.' Which it would seem to be."</p><p>“信不信由你，它真有名字。发射探测器的那些人将它命名为‘端点’，那是个古老的词汇，意思是‘一条线的尽头’，而它似乎正是如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Is the world part of the territory of the Province of Anacreon?"</p><p>谢顿说：“这个世界位于安纳克里昂星省境内吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not really," said Zenow. "If you'll study the red line and the red shading, you will see that the blue dot of Terminus lies slightly outside it -fifty light-years outside it, in fact. Terminus belongs to nobody; it's not even part of the Empire, as a matter of fact."</p><p>“并不尽然。”齐诺说，“如果仔细研究红线和红色阴影，你会看出来端点星的蓝点位于界外些许。事实上，是在五十光年外。端点星不属于任何人；认真说起来，它甚至不是帝国的一部分。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're right, then, Las. It does seem like the ideal world I've been looking for."</p><p>“那么你说对了，拉斯，它的确像是我正在寻找的那个理想世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course," said Zenow thoughtfully, "once you occupy Terminus, I imagine the Governor of Anacreon will claim it as being under his jurisdiction."</p><p>“当然啦，”齐诺若有所思地说，“一旦你登上端点星，我想安纳克里昂总督就会声称它在他的管辖范围内。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's possible," said Seldon, "but we'll have to deal with that when 1 he matter comes up."</p><p>“那是可能的，”谢顿说，“但等问题浮上台面，我们才需要设法解决。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow rubbed his hands again. "What a glorious conception. Setting up a huge project on a brand-new world, far away and entirely isolated, so that year by year and decade by decade a huge Encyclopedia of all human knowledge can be put together. An epitome of what is present in this Library. If I were only younger, I would love to join the expedition."</p><p>齐诺又搓了搓手。“多么壮阔的构想啊。在一个崭新的、遥远的、全然隔绝的世界上，创设一个庞大的计划，如此一年又一年，十载复十载，一套汇集人类全体知识的百科全书便能逐渐成形，它将是本馆整个内容的一个缩影。要是我再年轻些，我会很希望加入这场远征。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said sadly, "You're almost twenty years younger than I am." (Almost everyone is far younger than I am, he thought, even more sadly.)</p><p>谢顿悲伤地说：“你几乎比我年轻二十岁。”几乎人人都远比我年轻，他更悲伤地想道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow said, "Ah yes, I heard that you just passed your seventieth birthday. I hope you enjoyed it and celebrated appropriately."</p><p>齐诺说：“啊是啊，我听说你刚过完七十岁生日。我希望你过得很快乐，好好庆祝了一番。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon stirred. "I don't celebrate my birthdays."</p><p>谢顿突然动容。“我不庆祝生日。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, but you did. I remember the famous story of your sixtieth birthday."</p><p>“喔，不对啊，我还记得你庆祝六十大寿的盛事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt the pain, as deeply as though the dearest loss in all the world had taken place the day before. "Please don't talk about it," he said.</p><p>谢顿感到锥心的刺痛，仿佛那个世上最沉痛的失落就发生在昨天。“请不要谈这件事。”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Abashed, Zenow said, "I'm sorry. We'll talk about something else. If, indeed, Terminus is the world you want, I imagine that your work on the preliminaries to the Encyclopedia Project will be redoubled. As you know, the Library will be glad to help you in all respects."</p><p>齐诺有点尴尬。“我很抱歉，我们谈点别的吧。如果说，端点星确是你要找的那个世界，那么在我看来，你为百科全书计划所做的准备工作得加倍努力。你也知道，本馆在各方面都乐意帮助你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm aware of it, Las, and I am endlessly grateful. We will, indeed, keep working."</p><p>“我了解这一点，拉斯，我不胜感激。的确，我们一定会继续努力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He rose, not yet able to smile after the sharp pang induced by the reference to his birthday celebration of ten years back. He said, "So I must go to continue my labors."</p><p>他站了起来。由于刚才对方提到十年前的庆生会，他感到心如刀割，此时仍挤不出笑容。他说：“我必须告辞了，我得继续努力工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And as he left, he felt, as always, a pang of conscience over the deceit he was practicing. Las Zenow did not have the slightest idea of Seldon's true intentions.</p><p>当他离去时，照常因为这个欺骗行为而觉得良心受到严厉谴责。对于谢顿的真正意图，拉斯·齐诺根本没有半点概念。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p>3</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon surveyed the comfortable suite that had been his personal office at the Galactic Library these past few years. It, like the rest of the Library, had a vague air of decay about it, a kind of weariness-something that had been too long in one place. And yet Seldon knew it might remain here, in the same place, for centuries more-with judicious rebuildings-for millennia even.</p><p>哈里·谢顿打量着帝国图书馆这间舒适的套房，过去几年来，这里就是他的个人研究室。就像该馆其他各处一样，它弥漫着一种模糊的衰颓气氛，一种倦怠感，好似某样东西停在一处太久未曾移动。但是谢顿知道，未来数个世纪，甚至数千年间，只要适当的修葺不断，它都可能留在这里，留在同样的地方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How did he come to be here?</p><p>他当初怎么会来到这里？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Over and over again, he felt the past in his mind, ran his mental tendrils along the line of development of his life. It was part of growing older, no doubt. There was so much more in the past, so much less in the future, that the mind turned away from the looming shadow ahead to contemplate the safety of what had gone before.</p><p>一而再，再而三，他感到往事涌现心头，他的精神卷须沿着个人生命史往前回溯。毫无疑问，这是年事渐长的征兆之一。过去的内容累积了那么多，未来的内容剩下那么少，心灵因而不再窥探前方浮现的阴影，转而默想那些安全的过去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In his case, though, there was that change. For over thirty years psychohistory had developed in what might almost be considered a straight line-progress creepingly slow but moving straight ahead. Then six years ago there had been a right-angled turn-totally unexpected.</p><p>不过，对他而言，有个重大改变值得一再回味。曾有三十多年的时间，心理史学的发展几乎可以视为一条直线——进展虽然有如爬行般缓慢，但总是朝正前方前进。六年前，却出现了一个九十度转弯，一项完全意料之外的发展。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Seldon know exactly how it had happened, how a concatenation of events came together to make it possible.</p><p>谢顿十分清楚它是如何发生的，也很清楚许多连锁事件是如何扣在一起，终于使它成为事实。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was Wanda, of course, Seldon's granddaughter. Hari closed his eyes and settled into his chair to review the events of six years before.</p><p>当然，主角正是婉达，谢顿的孙女。他闭上眼睛，上身倒向椅背，开始重温六年前的那些往事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Twelve-year-old Wanda was bereft. Her mother, Manella, had had another child, another little girl, Bellis, and for a time the new baby was a total preoccupation.</p><p>十二岁的婉达若有所失。她的母亲玛妮拉有了另一个孩子，另一个小女孩，贝莉丝。一时之间，这个小宝宝成了百分之百的焦点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her father, Raych, having finished his book on his home sector of Dahl, found it to be a minor success and himself a minor celebrity. He was called upon to talk on the subject, something he accepted with alacrity, for he was fiercely absorbed in the subject and, as he said to Hari with a grin, "When I talk about Dahl, I don't have to hide my Dahlite accent. In fact, the public expects it of me."</p><p>她的父亲芮奇早已完成那本探讨母区达尔的着作。那本书小有成就，他也因此小有名气。他常应邀就书中主题发表演说，而他总是一口答应，因为他对这个题目极其投入。他曾咧嘴一笑，对谢顿说：“当我谈论达尔时，不必隐藏我的达尔腔。事实上，听众指望我有那种腔调。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The net result, though, was that he was away from home a considerable amount of time and when he wasn't, it was the baby he wanted to see.</p><p>不过，结果却演变成他常常不在家，而当他难得回家时，他想要看的是那个小宝宝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As for Dors-Dors was gone-and to Hari Seldon that wound was ever-fresh, ever-painful. And he had reacted to it in an unfortunate manner. It had been Wanda's dream that had set in motion the current of events that had ended with the loss of Dors.</p><p>至于铎丝——铎丝已经走了。对哈里·谢顿而言，那道伤痕永远淌血，永远疼痛难忍。而他的反应则很不妥当，他总认为是由于婉达的梦，才引发那一连串的事件，最后导致他失去了铎丝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda had had nothing to do with it-Seldon knew that very well. And yet he found himself shrinking from her, so that he also failed her in the crisis brought about by the birth of the new baby.</p><p>婉达与那个悲剧根本毫无关联，这点谢顿心知肚明。然而，他发觉自己开始躲着她。因此，在小妹妹降生所带来的危机中，他同样使婉达失望。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Wanda wandered disconsolately to the one person who always seemed glad to see her, the one person she could always count on. That WAS Yugo Amaryl, second only to Hari Seldon in the development of psychohistory and first in his absolute round-the-clock devotion to it. Hari had had Dors and Raych, but psychohistory was Yugo's life; he had no wife and children. Yet whenever Wanda came into his presence, something within him recognized her as a child and he dimly felt-for just that moment-a sense of loss that seemed to be assuaged only by showing the child affection. To be sure, he tended to treat her as a rather undersized adult, but Wanda seemed to like that.</p><p>郁郁的婉达只好去找那个似乎总是欢迎她的人，那个她总是可以依赖的人，而他就是雨果·阿马瑞尔。他对心理史学发展的贡献仅次于哈里·谢顿，而他无止无休的绝对投入则无人能及。谢顿曾拥有铎丝与芮奇，雨果却没有妻子儿女，心理史学就是他的生命。然而，婉达无论何时来到他面前，他内心深处总会模糊地感到（虽然一闪即逝）一种失落感，似乎唯有对这孩子表现亲爱才能缓和这种感觉。事实上，他倾向于把她当成一个小大人，但婉达似乎就喜欢这样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was six years ago that she had wandered into Yugo's office. Yugo looked up at her with his owlish reconstituted eyes and, as usual, took a moment or two to recognize her.</p><p>那是六年前的事，她晃荡到雨果的研究室，雨果抬起头，用一双重建过的眼睛严肃地望着她，如同往常一样，他花了点时间才认出她来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then he said, "Why, it's my dear friend Wanda. -But why do you look so sad? Surely an attractive young woman like you should never feel sad."</p><p>然后他说：“哈，是我亲爱的朋友婉达，但你为何看来那么伤心？像你这样一位年轻迷人的女子，当然绝不该感到伤心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Wanda, her lower lip trembling, said, "Nobody loves me."</p><p>婉达的下唇不停打战，她说：“没有人爱我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh come, that's not true."</p><p>“喔，好啦，那不会是真的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They just love that new baby. They don't care about me anymore."</p><p>“他们只爱那个小宝宝，他们不再关心我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I love you, Wanda."</p><p>“我爱你，婉达。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, you're the only one then, Uncle Yugo." And even though she could no longer crawl onto his lap as she had when she was younger, she cradled her head on his shoulder and wept.</p><p>“好吧，那么你就是唯一的一个，雨果叔叔。”虽然不能再像以前那样爬上他的膝头，她还是将脑袋枕在他肩上，默默哭了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl, totally unaware of what he should do, could only hug the girl and say, "Don't cry. Don't cry." And out of sheer sympathy and because he had so little in his own life to weep about, he found that tears were trickling down his own cheeks as well.</p><p>雨果完全不知所措，只能抱着这个女孩，对她说：“别哭，别哭。”出于全然的同情，又因为他自己这一生没有什么好哭的，他发觉自己的双颊也开始垂下泪滴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then he said with sudden energy, "Wanda, would you like to see something pretty?"</p><p>然后，他突然中气十足地说：“婉达，你想不想看一样美丽的东西？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?" sniffled Wanda.</p><p>“什么东西？”婉达抽噎着说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl knew only one thing in life and the Universe that was pretty. He said, "Did you ever see the Prime Radiant?"</p><p>在他的生命中与整个宇宙里，雨果只知道一样东西是美丽的。他说：“你听说过元光体吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. What is it?"</p><p>“没有，那是什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's what your grandfather and I use to do our work. See? It's right here."</p><p>“是你祖父和我工作上使用的东西。看到没？它就在这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He pointed to the black cube on his desk and Wanda looked at it woefully. "That's not pretty," she said.</p><p>他指了指书桌上那个黑色立方体，婉达悲伤地望了一眼。“那可不美丽。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not now," agreed Amaryl. "But watch when I turn it on."</p><p>“现在并不美丽。”雨果表示同意，“但注意看，我要把它启动了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did so. The room darkened and filled with dots of light and flashes of different colors. "See? Now we can magnify it so all the dots become mathematical symbols."</p><p>他开启元光体后，室内随即暗下来，并充斥着光点与各种色彩的闪光。“看到了吗？现在我们可以把它放大，好让所有的光点都变成数学符号。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so they did. There seemed a rush of material toward them and there, in the air, were signs of all sorts, letters, numbers, arrows, and shapes that Wanda had never seen before.</p><p>果然没错。似乎有一大团有形之物冲向他们，而在半空中，出现了婉达前所未见的种种符号，包括字母、数字、箭头与图案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Isn't it pretty?" asked Amaryl.</p><p>“美丽吗？”雨果问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, it is," said Wanda, staring carefully at the equations that (she didn't know) represented possible futures. "I don't like that part, though. I think it's wrong." She pointed at a colorful equation to her left.</p><p>“嗯，美丽。”婉达一面说，一面仔细瞪着那些（她自己并不知道）代表未来各种可能的方程式，“不过，我不喜欢那个部分，我想它错了。”她指向她左方一个色彩缤纷的方程式。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wrong? Why do you say it's wrong" said Amaryl, frowning.</p><p>“错了？你为什么说它错了？”雨果皱着眉头问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because it's not……pretty. I'd do it a different way."</p><p>“因为它不……美丽，换成我就不会这么做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl cleared his throat. "Well, I'll try to fix it up." And he moved closer to the equation in question, staring at it in his owlish fashion.</p><p>雨果清了清喉咙。“好吧，我会试着把它改好。”他凑近那个方程式，以他特有的严肃方式瞪着它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said, "Thank you very much, Uncle Yugo, for showing me your pretty lights. Maybe someday I'll understand what they mean."</p><p>婉达说：“非常感谢你，雨果叔叔，谢谢你给我看那些美丽的光线。也许有一天，我会了解它们的意义。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's all right," said Amaryl. "I hope you feel better."</p><p>“没什么，”雨果说，“我希望你感觉好一点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A little, thanks," and, after flashing the briefest of smiles, she left the room.</p><p>“好些了，谢谢。”她闪现一个短得不能再短的笑容，便离开了那间研究室。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl stood there, feeling a trifle hurt. He didn't like having the Prime Radiant's product criticized-not even by a twelve-year-old girl who knew no better.</p><p>雨果站在那里，感到有一点点伤心。他不喜欢有人批评元光体的产物，甚至一个什么都不懂的十二岁小女孩也不例外。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And as he stood there, he had no idea whatsoever that the psychohistorical revolution had begun.</p><p>他站在那里的时候，完全没有想到心理史学的革命已经开始。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>4</p><p>4</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That afternoon Amaryl went to Hari Seldon's office at Streeling University. That in itself was unusual, for Amaryl virtually never left his own office, even to speak with a colleague just down the hall.</p><p>当天下午，雨果来到哈里·谢顿位于斯璀璘大学的研究室。这件事本身就不寻常，因为雨果几乎从不离开自己的研究室，甚至不会去找同一层楼的同事讲几句话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari," said Amaryl, frowning and looking puzzled. "Something very odd has happened. Very peculiar."</p><p>“哈里，”雨果皱着眉头，看来十分困惑，“发生了一件非常古怪、非常奇特的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked at Amaryl with deepest sorrow. He was only fifty-three, but he looked much older, bent, worn down to almost transparency. When forced, he had undergone doctors' examinations and the doctors had all recommended that he leave his work for a period of time (some said permanently) and rest. Only this, the doctors said, might improve his health. Otherwise- Seldon shook his head. "Take him away from his work and he'll die all the sooner-and unhappier. We have no choice."</p><p>谢顿望着雨果，心中感到无比难过。他只有五十三岁，但他看起来老得多，弯腰驼背，而且衰弱得几乎毫无血色。他们曾押他去做身体检查，医生一致建议他暂停工作一段时间（甚至永远），以便好好休息。医生都说，唯有这样才有可能改善他的健康。否则的话……谢顿却摇摇头，答道：“逼他离开工作岗位，他反倒死得更快，而且更痛苦。我们毫无选择。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then Seldon realized that, lost in such thoughts, he was not hearing Amaryl speak.</p><p>然后谢顿发觉，刚刚陷入沉思之际，他没有听到雨果在说些什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "I'm sorry, Yugo. I'm a little distracted. Begin again."</p><p>他说：“很抱歉，雨果。我有点心不在焉，请再说一遍。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl said, "I'm telling you that something very odd has happened. Very peculiar."</p><p>雨果说：“我是在告诉你，发生了一件非常古怪、非常奇特的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is it, Yugo?"</p><p>“什么事，雨果？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was Wanda. She came in to see me-very sad, very upset."</p><p>“是婉达。今天她来看我，显得非常伤心，非常彷徨。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why?"</p><p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Apparently it's the new baby."</p><p>“显然是因为那个小宝宝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh yes," Hari said with more than a trace of guilt in his voice.</p><p>“喔，对。”谢顿的声音中透出好几分歉疚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So she said and cried on my shoulder-I actually cried a bit, too, Hari. And then I thought I'd cheer her up by showing her the Prime Radiant." Here Amaryl hesitated, as if choosing his next words carefully.</p><p>“她那么告诉我，又靠在我的肩头哭起来——其实我也哭了一点，哈里。后来我想到，可以用元光体逗她开心。”说到这里雨果迟疑了一下，仿佛在仔细选取下面的用字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Go on, Yugo. What happened?"</p><p>“说下去，雨果。发生了什么事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, she stared at all the lights and I magnified a portion, actually Section 428254. You're acquainted with that?"</p><p>“好吧，她瞪着四周所有的光线，而这时我放大了一部分，实际上是四二Ｒ二五四节。你对那部分熟悉吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon smiled. "No, Yugo, I haven't memorized the equations quite as well as you have."</p><p>谢顿微微一笑。“不熟悉，雨果。我不像你那样，把所有的方程式都牢记在心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, you should," said Amaryl severely. "How can you do a good job if- But never mind that. What I'm trying to say is that Wanda pointed to a part of it and said it was no good. It wasn't pretty. "</p><p>“啊，你应该那样做。”雨果以严厉的口吻说，“否则怎能做好工作……但别管这个了。我想要说的是，婉达指着其中一部分，并且说它不好，不美丽！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? We all have our personal likes and dislikes."</p><p>“有何不可？我们大家都有个人的好恶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, of course, but I brooded about it and I spent some time going over it and, Hari, there was something wrong with it. The programming was inexact and that area, the precise area to which Wanda pointed, was no good. And, really, it wasn't pretty."</p><p>“没错，当然。但我思量了一番，又花了些时间仔细检查一遍，结果，哈里，那里真有些不对劲。程序设计得不确切，而那个区域，正是婉达指的那个区域，的确是不好。而且，真的，它不美丽。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sat up rather stiffly, frowning. "Let me get this straight, Yugo. She pointed to something at random, said it was no good, and she was right?"</p><p>谢顿有点僵硬地坐直身子，并且皱起眉头。“让我把事情弄清楚，雨果。她随便指向某处，说它不好，结果她说对了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. She pointed, but it wasn't at random; she was very deliberate."</p><p>“是的。但她并不是随便乱指的，她非常仔细。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But that's impossible."</p><p>“但那是不可能的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But it happened. I was there."</p><p>“但它的确发生了，我在现场。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm saying it was just a wild coincidence."</p><p>“我不是说它没有发生，我是说这只是天大的巧合。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is it? Do you think, with all your knowledge of psychohistory, you could take one glance at a new set of equations and tell me that one portion is no good?"</p><p>“是吗？以你对心理史学的认识，你认为自己能对一组新的方程式瞥上一眼，就告诉我某一部分不好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Well then, Yugo, how did you come to expand that particular portion of the equations? What made you choose that piece for magnification?"</p><p>谢顿说：“好吧，雨果，你又怎么会特别扩展那部分的方程式呢？是什么使你选择那一块放大的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl shrugged. "That was coincidence-if you like. I just fiddled with the controls."</p><p>雨果耸了耸肩。“那倒是巧合，你可以这么说，我只是随手转了转控制钮。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That couldn't be coincidence," muttered Seldon. For a few moments he was lost in thought, then he asked the question that pushed forward the psychohistorical revolution that Wanda had begun.</p><p>“那不可能是巧合。”谢顿喃喃道。他随即陷入沉思，好一阵子之后，他问出一句话，推动了这场由婉达所引发的心理史学革命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "Yugo, did you have any suspicions about those equations beforehand? Did you have any reason to believe there was something wrong with them?"</p><p>他说：“雨果，你原先对那些方程式有没有任何疑虑？你有没有任何理由相信它们有什么不对劲？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl fiddled with the sash of his unisuit and seemed embarrassed. "Yes, I think I did. You see……"</p><p>雨果把弄着身上那套连身服的腰带，似乎显得有些尴尬。“没错，我认为真有。你可知道……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You think you did?"</p><p>“你‘认为’？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know I did. I seemed to recall when I was setting it up-it's a new section, you know-my fingers seemed to glitch on the programmer. It looked all right then, but I guess I kept worrying about it inside. I remember thinking it looked wrong, but I had other things to do and I just let it go. But then when Wanda happened to point to precisely the area I had been concerned about, I decided to check up on her-otherwise I would just have let it go as a childish statement."</p><p>“我知道真有。我似乎还记得，当我建立这组方程式的时候——那是新的一节，你该知道——我的手指似乎按错一个程序键。当时它看来没问题，但我猜我内心一直在担忧。我记得曾想到它看来不对劲，但我正好有其他的事要做，所以把它搁到一边去了。可是，当婉达刚好指向那个我念念不忘的区域时，我便决定好好检查一遍。否则的话，我会把它当成小孩的胡言乱语，根本不会追究。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you turned on that very fragment of the equations to show Wanda. As though it were haunting your unconscious mind."</p><p>“而你偏偏开启那一部分方程式给婉达看，就好像它正在你的潜意识里作祟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl shrugged. "Who knows?"</p><p>雨果耸了耸肩。“谁知道？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And just before that, you were very close together, hugging, both crying."</p><p>“而在此之前，你们两人非常接近，抱在一起，两人都哭了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl shrugged again, looking even more embarrassed.</p><p>雨果又耸了耸肩，显得更加尴尬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I think I know what happened, Yugo. Wanda read your mind."</p><p>谢顿说：“我想我知道发生了什么事，雨果，婉达透视了你的心灵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl jumped, as though he had been bitten. "That's impossible!"</p><p>雨果跳起来，仿佛被什么咬了一口。“那是不可能的！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Slowly Seldon said, "I once knew someone who had unusual mental powers of that sort"-and he thought sadly of Eto Demerzel or, as Seldon had secretly known him, Daneel- "only he was somewhat more than human. But his ability to read minds, to sense other people's thoughts, to persuade people to act in a certain way-that was a mental ability. I think, somehow, that perhaps Wanda has that ability as well."</p><p>谢顿则缓缓说道：“我曾经认识一个人，他就拥有那种不寻常的精神力量。”他悲痛地想到伊图·丹莫刺尔，或者该说丹尼尔，后者是只有谢顿才知道的秘密。“只不过他可以算是某种超人。可是他透视心灵、感知他人思想、说服他人采取某方面行动的能力，的确是一种精神力量。我想，说不定婉达也具有这种能力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can't believe it," said Amaryl stubbornly.</p><p>“我无法相信这种事。”雨果倔强地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can," said Seldon "but I don't know what to do about it." Dimly lie felt the rumblings of a revolution in psychohistorical research-but only dimly.</p><p>“我能，”谢顿说，“但我不知道该拿它怎么办。”他模糊地感到心理史学研究的革命已然迫近，但只是模模糊糊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>5</p><p>5</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Dad," said Raych with some concern, "you look tired."</p><p>“爸，”芮奇以关切的口气说，“你看起来很疲倦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I dare say," said Hari Seldon, "I feel tired. But how are you?"</p><p>“我想是吧。”谢顿道，“我感到疲倦。但你可好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych was forty-four now and his hair was beginning to show a bit of gray, but his mustache remained thick and dark and very Dahlite in appearance. Seldon wondered if he touched it up with dye, but it would have been the wrong thing to ask.</p><p>芮奇今年四十四岁，他的头发开始有些斑白，但他的八字胡仍旧乌黑浓密，看起来达尔味十足。谢顿怀疑他是否用过染剂，但这种问题是不能问的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Are you through with your lecturing for a while?"</p><p>谢顿说：“你的演讲告一段落了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For a while. Not for long. And I'm glad to be home and see the baby and Manella and Wanda-and you, Dad."</p><p>“暂时告一段落，但歇不了多久。我很高兴回到家里，看看宝宝、玛妮拉、婉达，还有你，爸。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you. But I have news for you, Raych. No more lecturing. I'm going to need you here."</p><p>“谢谢你。但我有个消息告诉你，芮奇。别再作演讲了，我这里需要你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych frowned. "What for?" On two different occasions he had been sent to carry out delicate missions, but those were back during the days of the Joranumite menace. As far as he knew, things were quiet now, especially with the overthrow of the junta and the reestablishment of a pale Emperor.</p><p>芮奇皱起眉头。“做什么？”过去，在两次不同的情况下，谢顿两度派他去执行棘手的任务，但都是在九九派作乱的时代。据他所知，如今一切很平静，更何况执政团已被推翻，一位弱势皇帝已经复辟。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's Wanda," said Seldon.</p><p>“是婉达的事。”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda? What's wrong with Wanda?"</p><p>“婉达？婉达有什么问题？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing's wrong with her, but we're going to have to work out a complete genome for her-and for you and Manella as well-and eventually for the new baby."</p><p>“她没什么问题，但我们得验出她的完整基因组，也要为你和玛妮拉做，小宝宝也迟早要做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For Bellis, too? What's going on?"</p><p>“贝莉丝也要？怎么回事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon hesitated. "Raych, you know that your mother and I always thought there was something lovable about you, something that inspired affection and trust."</p><p>谢顿犹豫了一下。“芮奇，你也知道，你母亲和我总是认为你有讨人喜欢的特质，能博取他人的好感和信任。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know you thought so. You said so often enough when you were trying to get me to do something difficult. But I'll be honest with you. I never felt it."</p><p>“我知道你这么想。每当你试图要我做什么困难的事，你就一再这么说。但我要坦白对你说，我从没感觉到这种特质。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, you won over me and……and Dors." (He had such trouble saying the name, even though four years had passed since her destruction.) "You won over Rashelle of Wye. You won over Jo-Jo Joranum. You won over Manella. How do you account for all that?"</p><p>“不，你征服了我和……和铎丝。”即使她的毁灭已是四年前的事，要他说出这个名字仍有极大的困难。“你征服了卫荷的芮喜尔，你征服了九九·久瑞南，你征服了玛妮拉。这一切你要怎么解释？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Intelligence and charm," said Raych, grinning.</p><p>“智慧和魅力。”芮奇咧嘴一笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have you thought you might have been in touch with their-our-minds?"</p><p>“你有没有想到，你也许接触过他们的——我们的心灵？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I've never thought that. And now that you mention it, I think it's ridiculous. -With all due respect, Dad, of course."</p><p>“不，我从没想到这种事。既然你提起了，我想说这实在无稽。请务必恕我直言，爸。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What if I told you that Wanda seems to have read Yugo's mind during a moment of crisis?"</p><p>“如果我告诉你，婉达似乎在一次难关中透视了雨果的心灵，你会怎么说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Coincidence or imagination, I should say."</p><p>“巧合或想象，我会这么说。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Raych, I knew someone once who could handle people's minds as easily as you and I handle conversation."</p><p>“芮奇，我曾经认识一个人，他能操控人们的心灵，就像你我操控语言一样容易。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Who was that?"</p><p>“那是谁？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can't speak of him. Take my word for it, though."</p><p>“我不能说出来。不过，相信我就对了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well……" said Raych dubiously.</p><p>“这个嘛——”芮奇深表怀疑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I've been at the Galactic Library, checking on such matters. There is a curious story, about twenty thousand years old and therefore back to the misty origins of hyperspatial travel. It's about a young woman, not much more than Wanda's age, who could communicate with an entire planet that circled a sun called Nemesis."</p><p>“我曾经到帝国图书馆，去查阅这方面的资料。有一个很稀奇的故事，时间大约在两万年前，换句话说，是在迷雾般的超空间旅行肇始期。故事的主角是个年轻女子，年龄不比婉达大多少，她能和整个行星沟通，那颗行星所环绕的太阳叫做‘复仇女神’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely a fairytale."</p><p>“不用说，当然是神话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely. And incomplete, at that. But the similarity with Wanda is astonishing."</p><p>“当然，而且残缺不全，但和婉达有惊人的相似之处。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "Dad, what are you planning?"</p><p>芮奇说：“爸，你在打算些什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not sure, Raych. I need to know the genome and I have to find others like Wanda. I have a notion that youngsters are born-not often but occasionally-with such mental abilities, but that, in general, it merely gets them in trouble and they learn to mask it. And as they grow tip, their ability, their talent, is buried deep within their minds-sort of an unconscious act of self-preservation. Surely in the Empire or even just among Trantor's forty billion, there must be more of that sort, like Wanda, and if I know the genome I want, I can test those I think may be so.?</p><p>“我还不确定，芮奇。我需要知道那些基因组，我还得再找些像婉达的人。我有个想法，某些小孩生来就有这种精神力量，虽然不常见，但偶尔总有。可是一般说来，只会为他们带来麻烦，于是他们学着掩饰。等到他们渐渐长大，他们的能力，他们的天赋，便埋藏在心灵深处，这是一种自保性的潜意识行动。在帝国境内，甚至仅在川陀四百亿人口之间，一定有不少像婉达这样的人。如果我知道了我所要的基因组，就能检验那些我认为可能的人选。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what would you do with them if you found them, Dad?"</p><p>“如果找到他们，你会怎么做呢，爸？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have the notion that they are what I need for the further development of psychohistory."</p><p>“我的想法是，进一步发展心理史学正需要他们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "And Wanda is the first of the type you know about and you intend to make a psychohistorian out of her?"</p><p>芮奇说：“而婉达是你发现的第一个，你打算让她成为一个心理史学家？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps."</p><p>“说不定。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Like Yugo. -Dad, no!"</p><p>“就像雨果。爸，不行！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why no?"</p><p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because I want her to grow up like a normal girl and become a normal woman. I will not have you sitting her before the Prime Radiant and make her into a living monument to psychohistorical mathematics."</p><p>“因为我要她像正常的女孩那样成长，然后变成一个正常的女人。我不会让你把她摆在元光体前，使她成为心理史学数学的一个活石碑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "It may not come to that, Raych, but we must have her genome. You know that for thousands of years there have been suggestions that every human being have his genome on file. It's only the expense that's kept it from becoming standard practice; no one doubts the usefulness of it. Surely you see the advantages. If nothing else, we will know Wanda's tendencies toward a variety of physiological disorders. If we had ever had Yugo's genome, I am certain he would not now be dying. Surely we can go that far."</p><p>谢顿说：“也许不至于，芮奇，但我们必须取得她的基因组。你也知道，数千年来一直有人建议，应该为每一个人的基因组建档。只是由于手续昂贵，才没有成为例行公事，但是绝没有人怀疑它的用处。你当然看得出这样做的优点，即使不为别的，我们也能知道婉达有没有任何生理异常的倾向。假使我们早就有雨果的基因组，我确定他现在不会奄奄一息。不用说，至少我们可以这样做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, maybe, Dad, but no further. I'm willing to bet that Manella is going to be a lot firmer on this than I am."</p><p>“好吧，也许，爸，但顶多只能这样做。我愿意打赌，对于这件事，玛妮拉会比我坚决得多。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Very well. But remember, no more lecture tours. I need you at home."</p><p>谢顿说：“很好。但你要记住，别再做任何演讲旅行，我需要你待在家里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll see," Raych said and left.</p><p>“看看吧。”说完芮奇便走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sat there in a quandary. Eto Demerzel, the one person he knew who could handle minds, would have known what to do. Dors, with her nonhuman knowledge, might have known what to do.</p><p>谢顿束手无策地坐在那里。伊图·丹莫刺尔，那位他确知能操控心灵的人，一定知道应该怎么做。而拥有超人知识的铎丝，也可能知道该怎么做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For himself, he had a dim vision of a new psychohistory-but nothing more than that.</p><p>至于他自己，他对新的心理史学有个模糊的憧憬，但也仅止于此。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>6</p><p>6</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not an easy task to obtain a complete genome of Wanda. To begin with, the number of biophysicists equipped to handle the genome was small and those that existed were always busy.</p><p>取得婉达的完整基因组不是一件容易的工作。首先，有能力分析基因组的生物物理学家少之又少，那些够资格的则总是很忙。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nor was it possible for Seldon to discuss his needs openly, in order to interest the biophysicists. It was absolutely essential, Seldon felt, that the true reason for his interest in Wanda's mental powers be kept secret from all the Galaxy.</p><p>谢顿也不可能为了引起生物物理学家的兴趣，而公开讨论他的需要。他觉得，自己对婉达的精神能力那么关心的真正原因，是绝对有必要对全银河保密的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And if another difficulty was needed, it was the fact that the process was infernally expensive.</p><p>假如还要列举其他的困难，那就是分析手续费贵得吓人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head and said to Mian Endelecki, the biophysicist he was now consulting, "Why so expensive, Dr. Endelecki? I am not an expert in the field, but it is my distinct understanding that the process is completely computerized and that, once you have a scraping of skin cells, the genome can be completely built and analyzed in a matter of days."</p><p>谢顿一面摇头，一面冲着他正在咨询的生物物理学家蜜安·恩德勒斯基说：“为什么那么贵，恩德勒斯基医师？我不是这方面的专家，但我清清楚楚地了解，分析手续完全电脑化，而且，一旦你取得皮肤细胞刮片，基因组在几天内便能完全建立，并且分析完毕。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's true. But having a deoxyribonucleic acid molecule stretching out for billions of nucleotides, with every puring and pyrimidine in its place, is the least of it; the very least of it, Professor Seldon. There is then the matter of studying each one and comparing it to some standard.</p><p>“那是事实。可是将一个去氧核糖核酸分子拉成几十亿个核苷酸，让每个嘌呤和嘧啶各就各位，却根本不是那么回事；绝对不是那么回事，谢顿教授。接下来，还要研究每一个基因，再和一些标准基因进行比对。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now, consider, in the first place, that although we have records of complete genomes, they represent a vanishingly small fraction of the number of genomes that exist, so that we don't really know how standard they are."</p><p>“现在，我们来想一想。首先，虽然我们有些完整基因组的记录，但和世上所有的基因组相比，却连九牛一毛还不到，因此我们并非真正知道它们有多标准。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon asked, "Why so few?"</p><p>谢顿问道：“为何那么少？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A number of reasons. The expense, for one thing. Few people are willing to spend the credits on it unless they have strong reason to think there is something wrong with their genome. And if they have no strong reason, they are reluctant to undergo analysis for fear they will find something wrong. Now, then, are you sure you want your granddaughter genomed?"</p><p>“有好些原因。费用是其中之一，很少有人愿意把信用点花在这上面，除非他们有强烈的理由，认为他们的基因组有什么问题。倘若没有强烈的理由，人们不会情愿接受分析，生怕因此发现什么问题。所以说，您确定要您的孙女接受基因组分析吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I do. It is terribly important."</p><p>“是的，我确定，这实在太重要了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why? Does she show signs of a metabolic anomaly?"</p><p>“为什么？她有任何代谢异常的症候吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, she doesn't. Rather the reverse-if I knew the antonym of 'anomaly.' I consider her a most unusual person and I want to know just what it is that makes her unusual."</p><p>“不，她没有。应该说刚好相反，可惜我不知道‘异常’有什么反义词。我认为她是最不寻常的人，而我要知道究竟是什么使她不寻常。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Unusual in what way?"</p><p>“哪方面不寻常？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mentally, but it's impossible for me to go into details, since I don't entirely understand it. Maybe I will, once she is genomed."</p><p>“精神方面，但我没办法详加叙述，因为我尚未全然了解。等她做完基因组分析，也许我就能说出所以然来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How old is she?"</p><p>“她今年几岁？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Twelve. She'll soon be thirteen."</p><p>“十二，就快满十三了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, I'll need permission from her parents."</p><p>“这样的话，我需要双亲的同意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon cleared his throat. "That may be difficult to get. I'm her grandfather. Wouldn't my permission be enough?"</p><p>谢顿清了清喉咙。“这点可能有困难。我是她的祖父，我的同意难道不够吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For me, certainly. But, you know, we're talking about the law. I donít wish to lose my license to practice."</p><p>“对我而言，当然够了。可是您该知道，我们现在谈的是法律，我可不希望被吊销营业执照。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was necessary for Seldon to approach Raych again. This, too, was difficult, as he protested once more that he and his wife, Manella, wanted Wanda to live a normal life of a normal girl. What if her genome did turn out to be abnormal? Would she be whisked away to be prodded and probed like a laboratory specimen? Would Hari, in his fanatical devotion to his Psychohistory Project, press Wanda into a life of all work and no play, shutting her off from other young people her age? But Seldon was insistent.</p><p>于是，谢顿需要再和芮奇打一次交道。这回同样很困难，因为芮奇再度抗议，说他与妻子玛妮拉，都希望婉达过着正常女孩的正常生活。万一她的基因组的确不正常，那该怎么办？她会不会被抓去接受各种检验，身上插满探针，活像个实验室的样本？谢顿会不会由于对心理史学计划过度狂热，而逼迫婉达过着只有工作没有娱乐的生活，禁止她与同龄的年轻人见面？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Trust me, Raych. I would never do anything to harm Wanda. But this must be done. I need to know Wanda's genome. If it is as I suspect it is, we may be on the verge of altering the course of psychohistory, of the future of the Galaxy itself!"</p><p>可是谢顿十分坚持。“相信我，芮奇，我绝不会做任何伤害婉达的事。但这点是一定要做到的，我需要知道婉达的基因组。倘若正如我猜测的那样，我们可能即将改变心理史学的发展方向，甚至改变整个银河未来的走向！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so Raych was persuaded and somehow he obtained Manella's consent, as well. And together, the three adults took Wanda to Dr. Endelecki's office.</p><p>因此芮奇被说服了，并设法取得了玛妮拉的同意。于是，三个大人一起带着婉达，来到恩德勒斯基医师的化验室。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mian Endelecki greeted them at the door. Her hair was a shining white, but her face showed no sign of age.</p><p>蜜安·恩德勒斯基在门口迎接他们。她有一头亮晶晶的白发，但她的脸庞毫无岁月的痕迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She looked at the girl, who walked in with a look of curiosity on her face but with no signs of apprehension or fear. She then turned her gaze to the three adults who had accompanied Wanda.</p><p>她望着那个女孩，后者带着好奇的表情走进来，但脸上并未显现任何忧虑或恐惧。然后，她转而望向陪同婉达前来的三位大人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dr. Endelecki said with a smile, "Mother, father, and grandfather-am I right?"</p><p>恩德勒斯基医师带着微笑说：“母亲、父亲和祖父，我说对了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon answered, "Absolutely right."</p><p>谢顿答道：“完全正确。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych looked hang-dog and Manella, her face a little swollen and her eyes a little red, looked tired.</p><p>芮奇显得卑躬屈膝；玛妮拉则显得相当疲倦，她的脸有点肿，双眼还有点红。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda," began the doctor. "That is your name, isn't it?"</p><p>“婉达。”女医师开口道，“那是你的名字，对吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, ma'am," said Wanda in her clear voice.</p><p>“是的，夫人。”婉达以清晰的口齿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm going to do with you. You're right-handed, I suppose."</p><p>“我要一五一十告诉你会对你做些什么。我猜，你惯用右手吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>“是的，夫人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Very well, then, I'll spray a little patch on your left forearm with an anesthetic. It will just feel like a cool wind. Nothing else. I'll then scrape a little skin from you just a tiny bit. There'll be no pain, no blood, no mark afterward. When I'm done, I'll spray a little disinfectant on it. The whole thing will take just a few minutes. Does that sound all right to you?"</p><p>“很好，那么，我会在你的左前臂一小块面积上喷些麻醉剂，感觉只会像一阵凉风，如此而已。然后我会从你的手臂上刮下一点皮肤，只是一点点。不会痛，不会流血，事后不会有疤痕。等我做完之后，我会再帮你喷些消毒药水，整个过程只会花几分钟的时间。这样听来还可以吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure," said Wanda, as she held out her arm.</p><p>“当然。”婉达一面说，一面伸出手臂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When it was over, Dr. Endelecki said, "I'll put the scraping under the microscope, choose a decent cell, and put my computerized gene analyzer to work. It will mark off every last nucleotide, but there are billions of them. It will probably take the better part of a day. It's all automatic, of course, so I won't be sitting here watching it and there's no point in your doing so, either.</p><p>采样完成后，恩德勒斯基医师说：“我会把刮片放在显微镜底下，选取一个优良的细胞，然后让我的电脑化基因分析仪开始工作。它会标示出每一个核苷酸，可是它们总共有好几十亿，所以或许要花上将近一天的时间。当然，它是全自动的，所以我不会坐在这里看着，而你们也没有必要那样做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Once the genome is prepared, it will take an even longer time to analyze it. If you want a complete job, it may take a couple of weeks. That is why it's so expensive a procedure. The work is hard and long. I'll call you in when I have it." She turned away, as if she had dismissed the family, and busied herself with the gleaming apparatus on the table in front of her.</p><p>“一旦基因组准备好，分析手续则需要更长的时间。假如您想要完整的报告，那也许得花上几个星期。这个手续如此昂贵的原因就在这里，它是个既困难又冗长的工作。等我得到结果后，我会以电话通知您。”说完她便转身，埋首于桌上那台闪闪发光的仪器，仿佛她已经把这家人送走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "If you come across anything unusual, will you get in touch with me instantly? I mean, don't wait for a complete analysis if you find something in the first hour. Don't make me wait."</p><p>谢顿说：“如果发现任何不寻常的结果，你会不会立刻和我联络？我的意思是，如果你在头一个小时就发现了什么，可别等分析完毕再通知我，别让我做无谓的等待。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The chances of finding anything in the first hour are very slim, but I promise you, Professor Seldon that I will be in touch with you at once if it seems necessary."</p><p>“头一个小时有任何发现的机会微乎其微，但我向您保证，谢顿教授，如果看起来有必要，我会马上和您联络。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Manella snatched Wanda's arm and led her off triumphantly. Raych followed, feet dragging. Seldon lingered and said, "This is more important than you know, Dr. Endelecki."</p><p>玛妮拉抓起婉达的手臂，打了胜仗般牵着她走出去。芮奇跟在后面，脚步有点拖泥带水。谢顿又逗留了一会儿，嘱咐道：“这件事的重要性超出你的想象，恩德勒斯基医师。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dr. Endelecki nodded as she said, "Whatever the reason, Professor, I'll do my best."</p><p>恩德勒斯基医师一面点头，一面说：“不论是什么原因，教授，我都会尽我的全力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon left, his lips pressed tightly together. Why he had thought that somehow the genome would be worked out in five minutes and that a glance at it in another five minutes would give him an answer, he did not know. Now he would have to wait for weeks, without knowing what would be found.</p><p>谢顿离去时紧抿着嘴唇。他为何会认为基因组在五分钟内便能准备好，再花五分钟看一眼便能得到答案？他自己也不明白。现在，他不得不等上几个星期，才能知道将会发现什么结果。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He ground his teeth. Would his newest brainchild, the Second Foundation, ever be established or was it an illusion that would remain always just out of reach?</p><p>他激动得咬牙切齿。他最新的智慧结晶“第二基地”是否能够建立起来？或者只是一个永远可望不可及的幻影？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>7</p><p>7</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon walked into Dr. Endelecki's office, a nervous smile on his face.</p><p>哈里·谢顿走进了恩德勒斯基医师的化验室，脸上挂着紧张兮兮的笑容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "You said a couple of weeks, Doctor. It's been over a month mow."</p><p>他说：“你告诉我要几个星期，医师，现在已经过了一个月。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dr. Endelecki nodded. "I'm sorry, Professor Seldon but you wanted everything exact and that is what I have tried to do."</p><p>恩德勒斯基医师点了点头。“很抱歉，谢顿教授，但您希望每件事都一丝不苟，我正是试图那样做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well?" The look of anxiety on Seldon's face did not disappear. What did you find?"</p><p>“怎么样？”谢顿脸上的焦虑并未消失，“你发现了什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A hundred or so defective genes."</p><p>“一百个左右的缺陷基因。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What! Defective genes. Are you serious, Doctor?"</p><p>“什么！缺陷基因？你在开玩笑吗，医师？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quite serious. Why not? There are no genomes without at least a hundred defective genes; usually there are considerably more. It's not as bad as it sounds, you know."</p><p>“我相当认真。有何不可呢？每个基因组至少都有一百个缺陷基因，通常还要多得多。您该知道，其实并不像听起来那么糟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I don't know. You're the expert, Doctor, not I."</p><p>“不，我不知道，医师。专家是你，不是我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dr. Endelecki sighed and stirred in her chair. "You don't know anything about genetics, do you, Professor?"</p><p>恩德勒斯基医师叹了一声，又在座椅中欠了欠身。“您对遗传学一无所知，对不对，教授？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I don't. A man can't know everything."</p><p>“没错，我不懂，一个人不可能什么都懂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're perfectly right. I know nothing about this-what do you call it?-this psychohistory of yours."</p><p>“您说得完全正确。我就对您的那个——您管它叫什么？——那个心理史学一窍不通。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dr. Endelecki shrugged, then continued. "If you wanted to explain anything about it, you would be forced to start from the beginning and I would probably not understand it even so. "Now, as to genetics……"</p><p>恩德勒斯基医师耸了耸肩，又继续说：“假如您想对我解释它的任何原理，您将被迫从头讲起，而就算这样做，我可能也无法了解。好了，至于遗传学……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well?"</p><p>“怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"An imperfect gene usually means nothing. There are imperfect genes-so imperfect and so crucial that they produce terrible disorders. These are very rare, though. Most imperfect genes simply don't work with absolute accuracy. They're like wheels that are slightly out of balance. A vehicle will move along, trembling a bit, but it will move along."</p><p>“一个有缺陷的基因通常不代表什么。没错，某些具有缺陷的基因，的确由于缺陷太过严重，因而导致一些可怕的疾病。不过，这种情形非常罕见。大多数有缺陷的基因，只是无法绝对精确地工作，就像有点不平衡的轮子。车辆照常能够行驶，虽然有点颠簸，可是仍然能行驶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is that what Wanda has?"</p><p>“婉达属于这种情形吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. More or less. After all, if all genes were perfect, we would all look precisely the same, we would all behave precisely the same. It's the difference in genes that makes for different people."</p><p>“是的，差不多就是这样。毕竟，假如所有的基因都完美无缺，我们看来便会全部一模一样，我们的言行举止也会全部一模一样。人和人的差异，就是基因的差异造成的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But won't it get worse as we grow older?"</p><p>“但是当我们年纪渐渐大了，难道不会越来越糟吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. We all get worse as we grow older. I noticed you limping when you came in. Why is that?"</p><p>“没错。我们年纪越大，情况就会越糟。我注意到您一跛一跛地走进来，为什么会这样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A touch of sciatica," muttered Seldon.</p><p>“有点坐骨神经痛。”谢顿喃喃道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Did you have it all your life?"</p><p>“您这辈子都是这样吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course not."</p><p>“当然不是。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, some of your genes have gotten worse with time and now you limp."</p><p>“看吧，您有些基因随着年龄而逐渐变差，害得您不良于行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what will happen to Wanda with time?"</p><p>“婉达将来又会发生什么问题呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know. I can't predict the future, Professor; I believe that is your province. However, if I were to hazard a guess, I would say that nothing unusual will happen to Wanda-at least, genetically-except the gathering of old age."</p><p>“我不知道。我无法预测未来，教授，我相信那是您的领域。然而，假如我大胆猜一猜，我会说除了逐渐老化之外，婉达不会发生任何不寻常的变化，至少就遗传学而言。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Are you sure?"</p><p>谢顿说：“你确定吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have to take my word for it. You wanted to find out about Wanda's genome and you ran the risk of discovering things perhaps it is better not to know. But I tell you that, in my opinion, I can see nothing terrible happening to her."</p><p>“您得相信我的话。想要分析婉达的基因组，您便冒着一个危险，那就是发现一些也许最好别知道的事。但是我可以告诉您，根据我的看法，我看不出她会发生什么可怕的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The imperfect genes-should we fix them? Can we fix them?"</p><p>“那些有缺陷的基因，我们该不该把它们修好？我们修得好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. In the first place, it would be very expensive. Secondly, the chances are that they would not stay fixed. And finally, people are against it.</p><p>“不该。原因之一，那样做太过昂贵。原因之二，它们再度突变的机会很大。最后一个原因，则是一般人反对这样做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But why?"</p><p>“可是为什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because they're against science in general. You should know this as well as anyone, Professor. I'm afraid the situation is such, especially since Cleon's death, that mysticism has been gaining ground. People don't believe in fixing genes scientifically. They would rather cure things by the laying on of hands or by mumbo-jumbo of some sort or other. Frankly it is extremely difficult for me to continue with my job. Very little funding is coming in."</p><p>“因为他们反对一切的科学。您对这点的了解应该不输任何人，教授。如今的情势只怕是神秘主义日渐壮大，而在克里昂死后尤其变本加厉。人们不再相信修复基因的科学方法，他们宁愿利用加持或各式各样的咒语来治病。坦白讲，我现在想要继续研究工作都极为困难，经费来源太少太少了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded. "Actually I understand this situation all too well. Psychohistory explains it, but I honestly didn't think the situation was growing so bad so rapidly. I've been too involved in my own work to see the difficulties all around me." He sighed. "I've been watching the Galactic Empire slowly fall apart for over thirty years now-and now that it's beginning to collapse much more rapidly, I don't see how we can stop it in time."</p><p>谢顿点了点头。“其实，我对这种情形了解得再透彻不过。心理史学对它有所解释，但我实在没想到情况这么快就变得这么糟。我对自己的工作太过投入，以致未曾注意周围这些困境。”他叹了一声，“过去三十多年来，我眼看着银河帝国逐渐四分五裂，现在它则以快得多的速度开始崩溃，我看不出我们怎能及时阻止。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you trying to?" Dr. Endelecki seemed amused.</p><p>“您在试图这样做吗？”恩德勒斯基医师似乎颇有兴趣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I am."</p><p>“是的，我在设法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Lots of luck. -About your sciatica. You know, fifty years ago it could have been cured. Not now, though."</p><p>“祝您吉星高照。至于您的坐骨神经痛，您可知道，五十年前是可以治好的。不过，现在不行了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?"</p><p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, the devices used for it are gone; the people who could have handled them are working on other things. Medicine is declining."</p><p>“这个嘛，治疗仪器没了；懂得操作那些仪器的人，通通做别的事去了。医疗水准同样在走下坡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Along with everything else," mused Seldon. "-But let's get back to Wanda. I feel she is a most unusual young woman with a brain that is different from most. What do her genes tell you about her brain?"</p><p>“和其他的一切一起衰落。”谢顿沉思了一会儿，“不过，我们还是回到婉达身上吧。我觉得她是个最不寻常的少女，拥有一个和大多数人不同的大脑。你从她的基因中，看出她的大脑有什么特殊吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dr. Endelecki leaned back in her chair. "Professor Seldon do you know just how many genes are involved in brain function?"</p><p>恩德勒斯基医师上身靠向椅背。“谢顿教授，您可知道和大脑运作有关的基因究竟有多少？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No.</p><p>“不知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'll remind you that, of all the aspects of the human body, the brain Junction is the most intricate. In fact, as far as we know, there is nothing m the Universe as intricate as the human brain. So you won't be surprised when I tell you that there are thousands of genes that each play a i0ale in brain function."</p><p>“让我提醒您一件事，在人体各个层面中，大脑的运作是最错综复杂的一环。事实上，根据目前的了解，宇宙中再也没有比人脑更复杂的结构。所以假如我告诉您，在大脑运作中扮演某种角色的基因有好几千个，您应该不会惊讶才对。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thousands?"</p><p>“几千个？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly. And it is impossible to go through those genes and see anything specifically unusual. I will take your word for it, as far as Wanda is concerned. She is an unusual girl with an unusual brain, but I see nothing in her genes that can tell me anything about that brain-except, of course, that it is normal."</p><p>“正是如此。想要一一检查这些基因，看看有没有任何特殊的不寻常，简直就是不可能的事。有关婉达的情形，我会相信您的话：她是个不寻常的女孩，拥有一个不寻常的大脑。可是我在她的基因中，看不出有关那个大脑的任何讯息——当然，除了看出它完全正常。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Could you find other people whose genes for mental functioning are like Wanda's, that have the same brain pattern?"</p><p>“你能不能根据婉达的精神运作基因，找到其他具有类似基因的人，那些具有相同大脑型样的人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I doubt it very much. Even if another brain were much like hers, there would still be enormous differences in the genes. No use looking for similarities. -Tell me, Professor, just what is it about Wanda that makes you think her brain is so unusual?"</p><p>“我认为没有什么可能。即使另一个大脑和她的十分相似，两者的基因还是会有巨大差异，寻找相似性根本没有用。告诉我，教授，婉达究竟有何特殊之处，会让您认为她的大脑如此与众不同？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "I'm sorry. It's not something I can discuss."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“很抱歉，我不能讨论这件事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, I am certain that I can find out nothing for you. How did you discover that there was something unusual about her brain-this thing you can't discuss?"</p><p>“这样的话，我绝对肯定我无法帮您找到什么。您如何发现她的大脑有不寻常之处，如何发现这件不能讨论的事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Accident," muttered Seldon. "Sheer accident."</p><p>“巧合，”谢顿喃喃道，“纯粹是巧合。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, you're going to have to find other brains like hers-also by accident. Nothing else can be done."</p><p>“这样的话，您若想找到其他类似的大脑，也必须借着巧合才行，没有别的办法了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Silence settled over both of them. Finally Seldon said, "Is there anything else you can tell me?"</p><p>沉默在两人之间徘徊许久，最后谢顿说：“你还能告诉我其他任何事吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm afraid not. Except that I'll send you my bill."</p><p>“只怕没有了，除了我会把账单寄给您。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon rose with an effort. His sciatica hurt him badly. "Well then, thank you, Doctor. Send the bill and I'll pay it."</p><p>谢顿吃力地站起来，坐骨神经痛令他难以忍受。“好吧，那就谢谢你了，医师。把账单寄给我，我会尽快付清。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon left the doctor's office, wondering just what he would do next.</p><p>哈里·谢顿离开了这位医师的化验室，简直不知道下一步该做什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>8</p><p>8</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Like any intellectual, Hari Seldon had made use of the Galactic Library freely. For the most part, it had been done long-distance through computer, but occasionally he had visited it, more to get away from the pressures of the Psychohistory Project than for any other purpose. And, for the past couple of years, since he had first formulated his plan to find others like Wanda, he had kept a private office there, so he could have ready access to any of the Library's vast collection of data. He had even rented a small apartment in an adjacent sector under the dome so that he would be able to walk to the Library when his ever-increasing research there prevented him from returning to the Streeling Sector.</p><p>就像任何一位知识分子一样，哈里·谢顿曾经自由地使用帝国图书馆。大多数的时候，他是借助于电脑联线，但他偶尔也会亲自造访，主要的目的是为了纾解一下心理史学计划的压力。几年前，自从他定下寻找类似婉达者的计划后，他便在那里申请了一间个人研究室，以便随时查询馆内收藏丰富的资料。他甚至还在邻区租了一间小公寓，这样一来，当此地越来越繁重的研究工作使他无法返回斯璀璘时，他便能步行来到这座图书馆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, however, his plan had taken on new dimensions and he wanted to meet Las Zenow. It was the first time he had ever met him face-to-face.</p><p>然而，如今，他的计划进入一个全新的层次，使他想要和拉斯·齐诺见上一面。这将是谢顿首次与他做面对面的接触。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not easy to arrange a personal interview with the Chief Librarian of the Galactic Library. His own perception of the nature and value of his office was high and it was frequently said that when the Emperor wished to consult the Chief Librarian, even he had to visit the Library himself and wait his turn.</p><p>想要和帝国图书馆的馆长安排一次私人会晤，绝对不是一件容易的事。馆长对这个职位的本质与身价自视甚高，因此常常有人说，就连皇帝希望咨询馆长时，也得亲自前往该馆，等候馆长的接见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon however, had no trouble. Zenow knew him well, though he had never seen Hari Seldon in person. "An honor, First Minister," he said in greeting.</p><p>然而，谢顿并没有遇到这种麻烦。齐诺虽然与哈里·谢顿从未谋面，却对他十分熟悉。“万分荣幸，首相。”这是他的欢迎词。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon smiled. "I trust you know that I have not held that post in sixteen years."</p><p>谢顿微微一笑。“我相信您一定知道，我不在那个职位已有十六年之久。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The honor of the title is still yours. Besides, sir, you were also instrumental in ridding us of the brutal rule of the junta. The junta, on a number of occasions, violated the sacred rule of the neutrality of the Library."</p><p>“这个头衔的荣耀仍是您的。此外，首相，我们得以摆脱执政团的残酷统治，您也功不可没。那个执政团，当年有好几次，都破坏了本馆中立的神圣原则。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Ah, thought Seldon that accounts for the readiness with which he saw me.)</p><p>啊，谢顿心想，这便解释了他为何那么爽快就答应见我。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Merely rumor," he said aloud.</p><p>“只是谣言罢了。”他高声道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And now, tell me," said Zenow, who could not resist a quick look at the time band on his wrist, "what can I do for you?"</p><p>“现在，请告诉我，”齐诺一面说，一面忍不住瞥了一眼手腕上的计时带，“我能为您做些什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Chief Librarian," began Seldon "I have not come to ask anything easy of you. What I want is more space at the Library. I want permission to bring in a number of my associates. I want permission to undertake a long and elaborate program of the greatest importance."</p><p>“馆长，”谢顿开始说，“我这次前来，对您提出的要求绝不简单。我想要的是在馆内拥有更大的空间，此外我要您批准我带一批同僚进来，还要您批准我从事一项长期而繁复的计划，但这项计划的重要性无与伦比。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Las Zenow's face drew into an expression of distress. "You ask a great deal. Can you explain the importance of all this?"</p><p>拉斯·齐诺脸上现出苦恼的表情。“您要求得可真不少。您能解释这一切有什么重要性吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. The Empire is in the process of disintegration."</p><p>“可以，帝国正处于土崩瓦解中。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was a long pause. Then Zenow said, "I have heard of your research into psychohistory. I have been told that your new science bears the promise of predicting the future. Is it psychohistorical predictions of which you are speaking?"</p><p>顿了好长一段时间，然后齐诺说：“我听说过您在研究心理史学。有人告诉我，说您的新科学有希望能预测未来。您现在说的，就是心理史学的预测吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. I have not yet reached the point in psychohistory where I can speak of the future with certainty. But you don't need psychohistory to know that the Empire is disintegrating. You can see the evidence yourself."</p><p>“不是。我在心理史学上的研究尚未达到那个境界，还无法信心十足地谈论未来。但您并不需要心理史学，也能知道帝国正在瓦解，您自己就能看到许多证据。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow sighed. "My work here consumes me utterly, Professor Seldon. I am a child when it comes to political and social matters."</p><p>齐诺叹了一口气。“我在这儿的工作占了我全部的时间，谢顿教授。一提到政治和社会问题，我就成了一个孩子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You may, if you wish, consult the information contained in the Library. Why look around this very office-it is chock-full of every conceivable sort of information from throughout the entire Galactic Empire."</p><p>“只要您愿意，您大可查询收藏在这座图书馆的各种资料。环顾一下这间办公室吧，它塞满了来自银河帝国各处、各式各样应有尽有的资料。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm the last to keep up with it all, I'm afraid," Zenow said, smiling sadly. "You know the old proverb: The shoemaker's child has no shoes. It seems to me, though, that the Empire is restored. We have an Emperor again."</p><p>“只怕，我是最跟不上时代的人。”齐诺露出悲伤的笑容，“您该知道一句古老的谚语：鞋匠的孩子没鞋穿。不过在我看来，帝国似乎已经复兴，我们现在又有了一位皇帝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In name only, Chief Librarian. In most of the outlying provinces, the Emperor's name is mentioned ritualistically now and then, but he plays no role in what they do. The Outer Worlds control their own programs and, more important, they control the local armed forces, which are outside the grip of the Emperor's authority. If the Emperor were to try to exert his authority anywhere outside the Inner Worlds, he would fail. I doubt that it will take more than twenty years, at the outside, before some of the Outer Worlds declare their independence."</p><p>“只是名义上如此，馆长。在大多数的偏远星省，皇帝的名字偶尔会仪式性地提上一提，可是他无法左右他们的所作所为。外围世界控制着自己的政治，而更重要的是，他们控制着当地的武装部队，这些部队完全不在皇帝掌握中。假使皇帝试图在内围世界之外任何角落行使权力，他都注定要失败。我怀疑顶多再过二十年，某些外围世界就会宣布独立。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow sighed again. "If you are right, we live in worse times than the Empire has ever seen. But what has this to do with your desire for more office space and additional staff here in the Library?"</p><p>齐诺又叹了一口气。“如果您说得对，我们便处于帝国有史以来最糟的时期。可是这一点，和您渴望在本馆获得更多空间、召来更多人员又有什么关系？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If the Empire falls apart, the Galactic Library may not escape the general carnage."</p><p>“如果帝国四分五裂，帝国图书馆或许也难逃这场劫数。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, but it must," said Zenow earnestly. "There have been bad times before and it has always been understood that the Galactic Library on Trantor, as the repository of all human knowledge, must remain inviolate. And so it will be in the future."</p><p>“喔，一定可以的。”齐诺一本正经地说，“过去也曾有过很糟的年头，可是人们一向了解，川陀上的帝国图书馆乃是人类全体知识的宝库，一定不可受到侵犯，而将来也会如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It may not be. You said yourself that the junta violated its neutrality.?</p><p>“也许不会，您自己说的，执政团曾破坏它的中立。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not seriously."</p><p>“并不严重。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It might be more serious next time and we can't allow this repository of all human knowledge to be damaged."</p><p>“下次可能就会更严重，我们不能允许这个人类全体知识的宝库被毁。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How will your increased presence here prevent that?"</p><p>“您在此地增加工作人员，怎么就能防止那种悲剧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It won't. But the project I am interested in will. I want to create a great Encyclopedia, containing within it all the knowledge humanity will need to rebuild itself in case the worst happens-an Encyclopedia Galactica, if you will. We don't need everything the Library has. Much of it is trivial. The provincial libraries scattered over the Galaxy may themselves be destroyed and, if not, all but the most local data is obtained by computerized connection with the Galactic Library in any case. What I intend, then, is something that is entirely independent and that contains, in as concise a form as possible, the essential information humanity needs."</p><p>“的确不能，但我所感兴趣的那个计划却可以。我想要制作一套伟大的百科全书，其中包含各种丰富的知识，万一最坏的情况果真发生，那些知识足以帮助人类重建文明——您可以称之为《银河百科全书》。我们并不需要本馆所有的一切，许多资料都过于浅显。散布在银河各处的地方图书馆也可能被毁，纵使它们得以幸免，除了最为区域性的资料，其他一切仍是借着电脑联线取自帝国图书馆。所以说，我打算做的是个全然独立的东西，并且要以尽可能简明扼要的形式，收录人类所需要的各种根本知识。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And if it, too, is destroyed?"</p><p>“万一它同样被毁呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I hope it will not be. It is my intention to find a world far away on the outskirts of the Galaxy, one where I can transfer my Encyclopedists and where they can work in peace. Until such a place is found, however, I want the nucleus of the group to work here and to use the Library facilities to decide what will be needed for the project."</p><p>“我希望不会。我的打算是在遥远的银河边缘找一个世界，让我能把手下的百科全书编者迁到那里去，让他们在那里平静地工作。然而，在找到那样一个地方之前，我想让核心成员在此工作，利用本馆的设备，来决定这个计划需要些什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow grimaced. "I see your point, Professor Seldon, but I'm not sure that it can be done."</p><p>齐诺现出痛苦的表情。“我懂了您的意思，谢顿教授，但我不确定是否办得到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not, Chief Librarian?"</p><p>“为何不能，馆长？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because being Chief Librarian does not make me an absolute monarch. I have a rather large Board-a kind of legislature-and please don't think that I can just push your Encyclopedia Project through."</p><p>“因为，身为馆长并不代表我就是独裁君主。我有个相当大的评议会，一种立法机构，请别以为我能轻易通过您的百科全书计划。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm astonished."</p><p>“我很惊讶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't be. I am not a popular Chief Librarian. The Board has been fighting, for some years now, for limited access to the Library. I have resisted. It galls them that I have afforded you your small office space."</p><p>“不必惊讶，我不是个很受欢迎的馆长。这些年来，评议会在力争对本馆的使用设限，而我一直拒绝。我提供小小一间研究室给您，就令他们火冒三丈了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Limited access?"</p><p>“设限？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly. The idea is that if anyone needs information, he or she must communicate with a Librarian and the Librarian will get the information for the person. The Board does not wish people to enter the Library freely and deal with the computers themselves. They say that the expense required to keep the computers and other Library equipment in shape is becoming prohibitive."</p><p>“正是如此。他们的想法是这样的，无论任何人需要一项资料，都必须和某位图书馆员联络，由那位馆员替他找来那项资料。评议会不希望人们自由进入本馆，亲自动手操作电脑。他们说，保养电脑和其他图馆设备的费用越来越贵得离谱。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But that's impossible. There's a millennial tradition of an open Galactic Library."</p><p>“但那是不可能的，开放式的帝国图书馆已是上千年的传统。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So there is, but in recent years, appropriations to the Library have been cut several times and we simply don't have the funds we used to have. It is becoming very difficult to keep our equipment up to the mark."</p><p>“的确没错，但是最近这些年，本馆的预算被削减好几次，我们再也没有像过去那么多的经费。想使我们的设备保持一定水准，成了一件非常困难的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon rubbed his chin. "But if your appropriations are going down, I imagine you have to cut salaries and fire people-or, at least, not hire new ones."</p><p>谢顿揉了揉下巴。“但如果你们的预算逐渐减少，我想您就得降低薪资，裁减人员——或者，至少不再雇用新人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You are exactly right."</p><p>“您说得完全正确。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In which case, how will you manage to place new labors on a shrinking work force by asking your people to obtain all the information that the public will request?"</p><p>“这样的话，在人力逐年缩减的情况下，您怎么有办法揽下新的工作，由您的手下来寻找公众索求的一切资料？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The idea is that we won't find all the information that the public will request but only those pieces of information that we consider important."</p><p>“他们的想法是，我们不再搜集公众将会索求的一切资料，而仅仅搜集我们认为重要的资料。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So that not only will you abandon the open Library but also the complete Library?"</p><p>“所以说，你们不只废止了开放式图书馆，同时也废止了完备式图书馆？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm afraid so."</p><p>“只怕就是如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can't believe that any Librarian would want this."</p><p>“我无法相信会有图书馆员想这样做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You don't know Gennaro Mummery, Professor Seldon." At Seldon's blank look, Zenow continued. " `Who is he?' you wonder. The leader of that portion of the Board that wishes to close off the Library. More and more of the Board are on his side. If I let you and your colleagues into the Library as an independent force, a number of Board members who may not be on Mummery's side but who are dead set against any control of any part of the Library except by Librarians may decide to vote with him. And in that case, I will be forced to resign as Chief Librarian."</p><p>“您不认识吉纳洛·麻莫瑞，谢顿教授。”面对谢顿一脸的茫然，齐诺继续说，“‘他是谁？’您一定在纳闷。他是评议会中希望封闭本馆那一派的领袖，评议会有越来越多的成员倒向他那边。假使我让您和您的同事进驻本馆，成为馆中一支独立的队伍，那么，有些评议委员原本或许不在麻莫瑞那边，但由于坚决反对外人控制本馆任何角落，也许便会决定投他一票。这样一来，我将被迫辞去馆长一职。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"See here," said Seldon with sudden energy. "All this business of possibly closing down the Library, of making it less accessible, of refusing all information-all this business of declining appropriations-all this iiiitself a sign of Imperial disintegration. Don't you agree?"</p><p>“您看吧，”谢顿突然中气十足地说，“所有的变故，包括可能关闭本馆、对它设限、拒绝搜集所有的资料，都可以归咎于预算逐年减少，而这一切的一切，本身就是帝国瓦解的一项征兆。您不同意吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you put it that way, you may be right."</p><p>“如果您要这么讲，或许也没错。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then let me talk to the Board. Let me explain what the future may hold and what I wish to do. Perhaps I can persuade them, as I hope I've persuaded you."</p><p>“那么让我去和评议会说说，让我来解释未来可能如何，以及我希望怎么做。说不定我能说服他们，正如我希望已经说服了您。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow thought for a moment. "I'm willing to let you try, but you must know in advance that your plan may not work."</p><p>齐诺考虑了一会儿。“我愿意让您试一试，但您事先必须知道，您的计划可能不会成功。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I've got to take that chance. Please do whatever has to be done and let me know when and where I can meet the Board."</p><p>“我一定得碰碰运气。请务必做到需要做的一切，并尽快让我知道我在何时何处能跟评议会碰面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon left Zenow in a mood of unease. Everything he had told the Chief Librarian was true-and trivial. The real reason he needed the use of the Library remained hidden.</p><p>谢顿向齐诺告别，怀着不安的心情离去。他告诉这位馆长的一切都是真的，而且平淡无奇。至于他需要使用这座图书馆的真正理由，他则守口如瓶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Partly this was because he didn't yet see that use clearly himself.</p><p>部分原因是，他自己也尚未看清楚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>9</p><p>9</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon sat at Yugo Amaryl's bedside-patiently, sadly. Yugo was utterly spent. He was beyond medical help, even if he would have consented to avail himself of such help, which he refused.</p><p>哈里·谢顿耐心地、悲伤地坐在雨果·阿马瑞尔的床沿。雨果完全油尽灯枯——他拒绝接受任何医疗，但即使愿意接受，他也早已回天乏术。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was only fifty-five. Seldon was himself sixty-six and yet he was in fine shape, except for the twinge of sciatica-or whatever it was-that occasionally lamed him.</p><p>他只有五十五岁。谢顿自己则已经六十六，但他健康状况良好，只有坐骨神经的刺痛（或者不管是什么痛）偶尔使他不良于行。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl's eyes opened. "You're still here, Hari?"</p><p>雨果张开眼睛。“你还在这儿，哈里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded. "I won't leave you."</p><p>谢顿点了点头。“我不会离开你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Till I die?"</p><p>“直到我死去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes." Then, in an outburst of grief, he said, "Why have you done this, Yugo? If you had lived sensibly, you could have had twenty to thirty more years of life."</p><p>“是的。”谢顿突然悲从中来，又说，“你为什么要这样做，雨果？假使你过着正常生活，你还能有二三十年的寿命。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl smiled faintly. "Live sensibly? You mean, take time off? Go to resorts? Amuse myself with trifles?"</p><p>雨果淡淡一笑。“正常生活？你的意思是休假？旅游？享受些微不足道的乐趣？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Yes."</p><p>“是的，是的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And I would either have longed to return to my work or I would have learned to like wasting my time and, in the additional twenty to thirty years you speak of, I would have accomplished no more. Look at you."</p><p>“那样的话，我要不是渴望赶紧回来工作，就是学会虚度光阴，而在你所谓多出来的二三十年间，我将一事无成。看看你自己。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What about me?"</p><p>“我怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For ten years you were First Minister under Cleon. How much science did you do then?"</p><p>“你在克里昂御前当了十年首相，那时你做了多少科学研究？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I spent about a quarter of my time on psychohistory," said Seldon gently.</p><p>“我把大约四分之一的时间花在心理史学上。”谢顿柔声道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You exaggerate. If it hadn't been for me, plugging away, psychohistorical advance would have screeched to a halt."</p><p>“你夸大了。要是没有我辛勤工作，心理史学的进展会戛然而止。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded. "You are right, Yugo. For that I am grateful."</p><p>谢顿点了点头。“你说得对，雨果，这点我很感激。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And before and since, when you spend at least half your time on administrative duties, who does--did-the real work? Eh?"</p><p>“而在此之前和之后，当你至少把一半时间花在行政事务上的时候，是谁在做实际的工作？啊？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You, Yugo."</p><p>“是你，雨果。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Absolutely." His eyes closed again.</p><p>“一点都没错。”他再度阖上眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Yet you always wanted to take over those administrative duties if you survived me."</p><p>谢顿说：“但你总是希望在我之后接掌那些事务。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No! I wanted to head the Project to keep it moving in the direction it had to move in, but I would have delegated all administration."</p><p>“不！我想要领导谢顿计划，是要让它保持在正轨上前进，但我会把所有的行政工作分派出去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl's breathing was growing stertorous, but then he stirred and his eyes opened, staring directly at Hari. He said, "What will happen to psychohistory when I'm gone? Have you thought of that?"</p><p>雨果的呼吸逐渐变得像是鼾声，但他随即惊醒，重新张开眼睛，直勾勾地瞪着谢顿。他说：“在我走了之后，心理史学会怎么样？你想过吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I have. And I want to speak to you about it. It may please you. Yugo, I believe that psychohistory is being revolutionized."</p><p>“是的，我想过。我现在就要和你谈谈这件事，它可能会让你高兴。雨果，我相信心理史学正在酝酿一场革命。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl frowned slightly. "In what way? I don't like the sound of that."</p><p>雨果微微皱起眉头。“什么方式？我不喜欢你这种口气。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Listen. It was your idea. Years ago, you told me that two Foundations should be established. Separate-isolated and safe-and arranged so that they would serve as nuclei for an eventual Second Galactic Empire. Do you remember? That was your idea."</p><p>“听好，那可是你的主意。几年前，你告诉我应该建立两个基地。彼此独立，安全地隔离起来，安排它们成为第二银河帝国的种子。你还记得吗？那是你的主意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The psychohistoric equations……"</p><p>“心理史学方程式……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know. They suggested it. I'm busy working on it now, Yugo. I've managed to wangle an office in the Galactic Library……"</p><p>“我知道，是那些方程式建议的。现在我正忙着进行，雨果。我在帝国图书馆设法弄到了一间研究室……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Galactic Library." Amaryl's frown deepened. "I don't like diem. A bunch of self-satisfied idiots."</p><p>“帝国图书馆，”雨果眉头锁得深了些，“我不喜欢他们，一伙自鸣得意的白痴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Chief Librarian, Las Zenow, is not so bad, Yugo."</p><p>“那位馆长，拉斯·齐诺，可没有那么坏，雨果。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Did you ever meet a Librarian named Mummery, Gennaro Mummery?"</p><p>“你见过一个叫吉纳洛·麻莫瑞的图书馆员吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, but I've heard of him."</p><p>“没有，但我听说过他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A miserable human being. We had an argument once when he claimed I had misplaced something or other. I had done no such thing and I grew very annoyed, Hari. All of a sudden I was back in Dahl. One thing about the Dahlite culture, Hari, it is a cesspool of invective. I used some of it on him and I told him he was interfering with psychohistory and he would go down in history as a villain. I didn't just say `villain,' either." Amaryl chuckled faintly. "I left him speechless."</p><p>“一个卑贱的人。我们有过一次争论，他硬说我把什么东西弄丢了。我根本是冤枉的，所以我非常恼怒，哈里。突然间我像是回到了达尔——达尔文化的一项特色，哈里，就是充满恶毒的脏话。我用了些在他身上，我说他在妨碍心理史学研究，历史会把他写成一个坏蛋，我也不只是说‘坏蛋’而已。”雨果孱弱地呵呵笑了几声，“我把他骂得哑口无言。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly Seldon could see where Mummery's animosity toward outsiders and, most probably, psychohistory must come from-at least, in part-but he said nothing.</p><p>谢顿突然恍然大悟，明白了麻莫瑞对外人（尤其是对心理史学）的憎恨从何而来——至少明白了一部分，但他什么也没有说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The point is, Yugo, you wanted two Foundations, so that if one failed, the other would continue. But we've gone beyond that."</p><p>“重点在于，雨果，你想要建立两个基地，以便如果一个失败了，另一个还能继续下去。但我们已经超越了这个设计。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In what way?"</p><p>“哪一方面？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you remember that Wanda was able to read your mind two years ago and see that something was wrong with a portion of the equations in the Prime Radiant?"</p><p>“你记不记得两年前，婉达透视你的心灵，看出元光体中某个部分的方程式不对劲？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, of course."</p><p>“当然记得。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, we will find others like Wanda. We will have one Foundation that will consist largely of physical scientists, who will preserve the knowledge of humanity and serve as the nucleus for the Second Empire. And there will be a Second Foundation of psychohistorians only-mentalists, mind-touching psychohistorians-who will be able to work on psychohistory in a multiminded way, advancing it far more quickly than individual thinkers ever could. They will serve as a group who will introduce fine adjustments as time goes on, you see. Ever in the background, watching. They will be the Empire's guardians."</p><p>“好，我们要找一些类似婉达的人。我们将建立一个主要由物理科学家组成的基地，他们会保存人类的知识，会成为第二帝国的种子。此外还会有个仅由心理史学家组成的第二基地——他们是精神学家，是能触动心灵的心理史学家——他们能以集体心灵的方式研究心理史学，进展将远比任何个别心灵更为迅速。在未来的岁月里，他们这组人将负责导入微调，你懂了吧。他们将始终隐身幕后，静观其变；他们将是第二帝国的守护者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wonderful!" said Amaryl weakly. "Wonderful! You see how I've chosen the right time to die? There's nothing left for me to do."</p><p>“太好了！”雨果虚弱地说，“太好了！你看我选的死期多么恰当？已经没有什么需要我做的了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't say that, Yugo."</p><p>“别这样说，雨果。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't make such a fuss over it, Hari. I'm too tired to do anything. Thank you-thank you-for telling me"-his voice was weakening-îabout the revolution. It makes me-happy----------……"</p><p>“别大惊小怪，哈里。我太累了，什么也不能做了。谢谢你……谢谢你……告诉我……”他的声音越来越微弱，“这场革命。这使我很……高兴……高兴……高……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And those were Yugo Amaryl's last words.</p><p>这便是雨果·阿马瑞尔最后的几句话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon bent over the bed. Tears stung his eyes and rolled down his cheeks.</p><p>谢顿伏在床上，泪水烫伤了他的眼睛，然后顺着双颊滚滚而下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Another old friend gone. Demerzel, Cleon, Dors, now Yugo……leaving him emptier and lonelier as he grew old.</p><p>又一个老朋友走了。丹莫刺尔，克里昂，铎丝，现在则轮到雨果……令他的晚年越来越空虚，越来越孤独。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And the revolution that had allowed Amaryl to die happy might never come to pass. Could he manage to make use of the Galactic Library? Could he find more people like Wanda? Most of all, how long would it take?</p><p>而让雨果含笑以终的这场革命，却有可能永远无法实现。他能否设法获得帝国图书馆的使用权？他能否找到更多像婉达的人？最重要的是，得花多久时间？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was sixty-six. If only he could have started this revolution at thirty-two when he first came to Trantor . </p><p>谢顿此时六十六岁。假使他在三十二岁、刚刚抵达川陀之际，便能展开这场革命，那该有多好……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now it might be too late.</p><p>现在或许太迟了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>10</p><p>10</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gennaro Mummery was making him wait. It was a studied discourtesy, even insolence, but Hari Seldon remained calm.</p><p>吉纳洛·麻莫瑞让他等了很久。这是蓄意的失礼，甚至是傲慢，但哈里·谢顿仍保持冷静。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After all, Seldon needed Mummery badly and for him to become angry with the Librarian would only hurt himself. Mummery would, in fact, be delighted with an angry Seldon.</p><p>毕竟，谢顿万分需要麻莫瑞的帮助。他若对这位图书馆员发怒，只会伤害到他自己。事实上，麻莫瑞会乐于见到一位生气的谢顿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So Seldon kept his temper and waited and eventually Mummery did walk in. Seldon had seen him before-but only at a distance. This was the first time they would be together alone.</p><p>因此谢顿按捺住脾气，耐心地等待，最后麻莫瑞终于走进来。谢顿以前曾见过他，但只是远远的一瞥，这是他们两人首次的单独会晤。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mummery was short and plump, with a round face and a dark little beard. He wore a smile on his face, but Seldon suspected that smile of being a meaningless fixture. It revealed yellowish teeth and Mummery's inevitable hat was of a similar shade of yellow with a brown line snaking around it.</p><p>麻莫瑞身材矮胖，有一张圆脸，以及少许深色的络腮胡。他脸上挂着笑容，但谢顿觉得那只是无意义的装饰。这个笑容使他露出一口黄板牙，而他头上那顶不可或缺的帽子也具有类似的黄色色调，并且盘绕着一道褐色的线条。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt a touch of nausea. It seemed to him that he would dislike Mummery, even if he had no reason to do so.</p><p>谢顿感到有点恶心。他觉得自己会很讨厌麻莫瑞，即使他毫无理由那样做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mummery said, without any preliminaries, "Well, Professor, what can I do for you?" He looked at the time-strip on the wall but made no apology for being late.</p><p>麻莫瑞并未做任何开场白，直截了当地说：“好啦，教授，我能为你做些什么？”他望了望墙上的计时片，却没有为迟到而道歉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I would like to ask you, sir, to put an end to your opposition to my remaining here at the Library."</p><p>谢顿说：“我想要请求你，馆员阁下，别再反对我留在这座图书馆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mummery spread his hands. "You've been here for two years. What Opposition are you speaking of?"</p><p>麻莫瑞两手一摊。“你在这里已经待了两年，你说的是哪门子反对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So far, that portion of the Board represented by you and those who believe as you do have been unable to outvote the Chief Librarian, but there will be another meeting next month and Las Zenow tells me he is uncertain of the result."</p><p>“目前为止，在评议会中，你代表的那一派以及和你志同道合的人，还不能胜过支持馆长的票数。但下个月将有另一次会议，而拉斯·齐诺告诉我，他无法确定会有什么结果。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mummery shrugged. "So am I uncertain. Your lease-if we can call it that-may well be renewed."</p><p>麻莫瑞耸了耸肩。“我也无法确定。你的租赁——姑且这么称呼——很有可能续约。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I need more than that, Librarian Mummery. I wish to bring in some colleagues. The project in which I am engaged-the establishment of what is needed in the way of the eventual preparation of a very special Encyclopedia-is not one I can do alone."</p><p>“可是我的需要不只如此而已，麻莫瑞馆员，我还希望带些同事进来。我正在进行的计划，不是我一个人做得到的，我最终的目的，是准备编纂一套非常特别的百科全书。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely your colleagues can work wherever they please. Trantor is a large world."</p><p>“你的同事爱在哪儿工作，当然就能在哪儿工作，川陀是个很大的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We must work in the Library. I am an old man, sir, and I am in a hurry."</p><p>“我们必须在这座图书馆工作。我是个老人，馆员阁下，我没有多少时间。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Who can stay the advance of time? I don't think the Board will allow you to bring in colleagues. The thin edge of the wedge, Professor?"</p><p>“谁又能制止时间的流逝呢？我认为评议会不会准许你把同事带进来。牵一发而动全身，是吗，教授？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Yes, indeed, thought Seldon, but he said nothing.)</p><p>是啊，的确没错，谢顿心想，但他什么也没说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mummery said, "I have not been able to keep you out, Professor. Not so far. But I think I can continue to keep out your colleagues."</p><p>麻莫瑞又说：“我一直无法把你拦在外面，教授，至少目前还不行。但是我想，我能继续把你的同事拦在外面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon realized that he was getting nowhere. He opened the touch of frankness a notch. He said, "Librarian Mummery, surely your animosity toward me is not personal. Surely you understand the importance of the work I am doing."</p><p>谢顿了解到自己将一无所获，便将坦白的程度再升一级。他说：“麻莫瑞馆员，你对我的憎恨当然不是私怨，你当然了解我在从事的工作多么重要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You mean, your psychohistory. Come, you have been working on it for over thirty years. What has come of it?"</p><p>“你的意思是，你的心理史学。得了吧，你在那上面花的时间超过三十年，可是又有什么成果？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's the point. Something may come of it now."</p><p>“那正是重点，现在可能要有成果了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then let something come of it at Streeling University. Why must it be at the Galactic Library?"</p><p>“那就让这个成果诞生在斯璀璘大学，为何一定要在帝国图书馆？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Librarian Mummery. Listen to me. What you want is to close the Library to the public. You wish to smash a long tradition. Have you the heart to do that?"</p><p>“麻莫瑞馆员，听我说。你想要做的是对公众关闭这座图书馆，你希望粉碎一项悠久的传统。你狠得下心这样做吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's not heart we need. It's funding. Surely the Chief Librarian has wept on your shoulder in telling you our woes. Appropriations are down, salaries are cut, needed maintenance is absent. What are we to do? We've got to cut services and we certainly can't afford to support you and your colleagues with offices and equipment."</p><p>“我们需要的不是狠心，而是经费。馆长当然曾靠在你的肩头哭泣，把我们的悲哀告诉了你。预算逐年删减，薪资降低，必需的保养维护全没了。我们要怎么办？我们不得不减少服务项目，而且当然供不起你和你的同事所需的研究室和设备。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Has this situation been put to the Emperor?"</p><p>“这种情况有没有禀奏陛下？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come, Professor, you're dreaming. Isn't it true that your psychohistory tells you that the Empire is deteriorating? I've heard you referred to as Raven Seldon, something that, I believe, refers to a fabled bird of ill omen."</p><p>“得了吧，教授，你在做梦。你的心理史学不是告诉你，帝国正在逐渐衰落吗？我听说有人称你为乌鸦嘴谢顿，我相信那是指寓言中一种不吉利的鸟儿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's true that we are entering bad times."</p><p>“我们的确正在进入一个很糟的时代。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And do you believe the Library is immune to those bad times? Professor, the Library is my life and I want it to continue, but it won't continue unless we can find ways of making our dwindling appropriations do. -And you come here expecting an open Library, with yourself as beneficiary. It won't do, Professor. It just won't do."</p><p>“而你相信本馆偏偏能幸免吗？教授，这座图书馆如同我的生命，我要它延续下去，但除非我们找到些法子，让我们逐年缩减的经费能凑合着用，否则它一定无法延续。而你却来到这里，指望有个开放式图书馆，让你自己成为受益者。办不到，教授，根本办不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said desperately, "What if I find the credits for you?"</p><p>谢顿抱着一线希望说：“要是我能帮你们找到信用点呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Indeed. How?"</p><p>“是吗，怎么找？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What if I talk to the Emperor? I was once First Minister. He'll see me and he'll listen to me."</p><p>“要是我有办法和陛下说说呢？我担任过首相，他会接见我，他会听我陈情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you'll get funding from him?" Mummery laughed.</p><p>“然后你就会从他那里得到经费？”麻莫瑞哈哈大笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If I do, if I increase your appropriations, may I bring in my colleagues?"</p><p>“如果我能做到，如果我能增加你们的预算，我可否带我的同事进来？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Bring in the credits first," said Mummery, "and we'll see. But I don't think you will succeed."</p><p>“先把信用点带来，”麻莫瑞道，“那时我们再说。但我可不认为你会成功。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He seemed very sure of himself and Seldon wondered how often and how uselessly the Galactic Library had already appealed to the Emperor.</p><p>他似乎非常自信。谢顿不禁怀疑，帝国图书馆究竟向皇帝请愿多么频繁，效果又是多么微弱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And whether his own appeal would get anywhere at all.</p><p>而他也怀疑自己的请愿是否会有任何成效。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>11</p><p>11</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor Agis XIV had no real right to the name. He had adopted it upon succeeding to the throne with the deliberate purpose of connecting himself with the Agises who had ruled two thousand years ago, most of them quite ably-particularly Agis VI, who had ruled for forty-two years and who had kept order in a prosperous Empire with a firm but nontyrannical hand.</p><p>艾吉思大帝十四世其实名不符实。他在即位时选用这个名号，是刻意和二千年前统治帝国的几位艾吉思大帝攀关系。那些皇帝大多相当能干，尤其是在位长达四十二年之久的艾吉思六世——他曾以强硬却不暴虐的手段，将繁荣的帝国治理得井然有序。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Agis XIV did not look like any of the old Agises-if the holographic records had any value. But, then again, truth be told, Agis XIV did not look much like the official holograph that was distributed to the public.</p><p>假如全息记录有些可信度，艾吉思十四世看起来就不像之前任何一位艾吉思大帝。但是，话说回来，根据可靠的消息，艾吉思十四世本人长得不太像公开流传的官方全息像。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As a matter of fact, Hari Seldon thought, with a twinge of nostalgia, that Emperor Cleon, for all his flaws and weaknesses, had certainly looked Imperial.</p><p>事实上，哈里·谢顿带着怀旧的惆怅想到，纵使克里昂大帝有百般缺点与弱点，他的帝王风范却毋庸置疑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Agis XIV did not. Seldon had never seen him at close quarters and the few holographs he had seen were outrageously inaccurate. The Imperial holographer knew his job and did it well, thought Seldon wryly.</p><p>艾吉思十四世则不然。谢顿从未真正见过这位皇帝，而他看过的几张全息像又极度失真。皇家全息摄影师知道该怎么做，而且做得很好，谢顿挖苦地想。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Agis XIV was short, with an unattractive face and slightly bulging eyes that did not seem alight with intelligence. His only qualification for the throne was that he was a collateral relative of Cleon.</p><p>艾吉思十四世身材矮小，拥有一副其貌不扬的面容，稍微鼓胀的双眼似乎欠缺智慧的光芒。他会有资格坐在皇位上，仅仅因为他是克里昂的旁系亲属。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To do him credit, however, he did not try to play the role of the mighty Emperor. It was understood that he rather liked to be called the "Citizen Emperor" and that only Imperial protocol and the outraged outcry of the Imperial Guard prevented him from exiting the dome and wandering the walkways of Trantor. Apparently, the story went, he wished to shake hands with the citizens and hear their complaints in person.</p><p>然而，他也有值得称道的一面，那就是他并未试图扮演一位强势皇帝。大家都了解，他喜欢被称为“平民皇帝”。只因为皇家规范与禁卫军的大声疾呼，他才无法走入穹顶，在川陀的人行道上闲逛。传言又说，他显然希望能和平民握握手，亲耳听听他们的怨言。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Score one for him, thought Seldon, even if it could never come to pass.)</p><p>值得给他一分，谢顿心想，即使这点永远无法实现。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With a murmur and a bow, Seldon said, "I thank you, Sire, for consenting to see me."</p><p>喃喃请安一句，再一鞠躬之后，谢顿开口道：“感谢陛下同意接见我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Agis XIV had a clear and rather attractive voice, quite out of keeping with his appearance. He said, "An ex-First Minister must surely have his privileges, although I must give myself credit for amazing courage in agreeing to see you."</p><p>艾吉思十四世的声音清晰且相当动听，与他的外表十分不相称。他说：“一位前首相当然应该有些特权，不过，我必须赞誉自己勇气可嘉，因为我有惊人的勇气同意见你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was humor in his words and Seldon found himself suddenly realizing that a man might not look intelligent and yet might be intelligent just the same.</p><p>他的话语透着幽默，谢顿突然领悟到一件事：一个看起来或许不聪明的人，实际上仍有可能是聪明人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Courage, Sire?"</p><p>“勇气，陛下？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, of course. Don't they call you Raven Seldon?"</p><p>“啊，当然啦。他们不是叫你乌鸦嘴谢顿吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I heard the expression, Sire, the other day for the first time."</p><p>“启禀陛下，几天前，我才头一次听到这种说法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Apparently the reference is to your psychohistory, which seems to predict the Fall of the Empire."</p><p>“显然那是针对你的心理史学，它似乎预言了帝国的衰亡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It points out the possibility only, Sire……"</p><p>“它只是指出这个可能性，陛下……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So that you are coupled with a mythic bird of ill omen. Except that I think you yourself are the bird of ill omen."</p><p>“于是，就有人把你和神话中一种不吉利的鸟儿联想在一起。只是在我看来，你正是一只不吉利的鸟儿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I hope not, Sire."</p><p>“启禀陛下，我希望不是。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come, come. The record is clear. Eto Demerzel, Cleon's old First Minister, was impressed with your work and look what happened-he was forced out of his position and into exile. The Emperor Cleon himself was impressed with your work and look what happened-he was assassinated. The military junta was impressed with your work and look what happened-they were swept away. Even the Joranumites, it is said, were impressed with your work and, behold, they were destroyed. And now, O Raven Seldon, you come to see me. What may I expect?"</p><p>“得了，得了，过去的记录清楚得很。伊图·丹莫刺尔，克里昂原来的首相，他看好你的研究工作，结果有什么下场？他被迫离职，自我放逐。克里昂大帝本人看好你的研究工作，结果有什么下场？他遇刺身亡。军人执政团看好你的研究工作，结果有什么下场？他们烟消云散。据说，连那些九九派也看好你的研究工作，结果，你看，他们同样被摧毁了。而现在，喔，乌鸦嘴谢顿，你来见我了。我又能指望什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, nothing evil, Sire."</p><p>“啊，不会有任何凶险的，陛下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I imagine not, because unlike all these others I have mentioned, I am not impressed with your work. Now tell me why you are here."</p><p>“我也这么想，因为我和刚才提到的那些人都不同，我并不看好你的研究工作。现在告诉我，你来此究竟有什么目的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He listened carefully and without interruption while Seldon explained the importance of setting up a Project designed to prepare an encyclopedia that would preserve human learning if the worst happened.</p><p>于是谢顿开始解释，说筹备那套百科全书的计划有多么重要，假如最坏的情况果真发生，它能够替人类保存所有的知识。艾吉思十四世一直仔细聆听，从头到尾没有插嘴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes yes," said Agis XIV finally, "so you are, indeed, convinced the Empire will fall."</p><p>“是啊，是啊，”艾吉思十四世终于开口，“所以说，你的确深信帝国将要衰亡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is a strong possibility, Sire, and it would not be prudent to refuse to take that possibility into account. In a way, I wish to prevent it if I can -or ameliorate the effects if I can't."</p><p>“启禀陛下，这是个强烈的可能性，拒绝考虑这个可能性将是不智之举。只要我有办法，我希望在某种程度上阻止这个结果；即使没有办法，我也要减轻它的效应。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Raven Seldon if you continue to poke your nose into matters, I am convinced that the Empire will fall and that nothing can help it."</p><p>“乌鸦嘴谢顿，如果你继续在这方面钻牛角尖，我就会相信帝国真要衰亡，而且根本无法阻止。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not so, Sire. I ask only permission to work."</p><p>“不是这样的，陛下，我只要求准许我继续工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, you have that, but I fail to see what it is you wish of me. Why have you told me all this about an encyclopedia?"</p><p>“喔，这没问题，但我还不了解你希望我怎样帮你。你为什么告诉我关于这套百科全书的种种？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because I wish to work in the Galactic Library, Sire, or, more accurately, I wish others to work there with me."</p><p>“因为我希望在帝国图书馆内工作，陛下，或者更精确地说，我希望其他人能和我一起在那里工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I assure you that I won't stand in your way."</p><p>“我向你保证，我不会从中作梗。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That is not enough, Sire. I want you to help."</p><p>“那还不够，陛下，我还要您帮助我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In what way, ex-First Minister?"</p><p>“哪一方面呢，前首相？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"With funding. The Library must have appropriations or it will close its doors to the public and evict me."</p><p>“提供经费。必须拨款给那座图书馆，否则它会对公众关门，并将我赶出去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Credits!'" A note of astonishment came into the Emperor's voice. "You came to me for credits?"</p><p>“信用点！”皇帝的声音中透着惊愕，“你来找我要信用点？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Sire."</p><p>“是的，陛下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Agis XIV stood up in some agitation. Seldon stood up at once also, but Agis waved him down.</p><p>艾吉思十四世心慌意乱地站起来，谢顿立刻跟着起身，但艾吉思挥手示意他坐下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sit down. Don't treat me as an Emperor. I'm not an Emperor. I didn't want this job, but they made me take it. I was the nearest thing to the Imperial family and they jabbered at me that the Empire needed an Emperor. So they have me and a lot of good I am to them.</p><p>“坐下，别把我当皇帝看待。我并不是皇帝，我原本不想要这份工作，但是他们硬要我接受。我是和皇室最近的亲戚，他们就在我耳边吱吱喳喳，说帝国需要一位皇帝。所以他们拥我出来，这样对他们有很大的好处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Credits! You expect me to have credits! You talk about the Empire disintegrating. How do you suppose it disintegrates? Are you thinking of rebellion? Of civil war? Of disorders here and there?</p><p>“信用点！你指望我有信用点！你说帝国正在瓦解，请问你认为它会怎样瓦解？你心里想的是叛变？是内战？还是各处的骚乱？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. Think of credits. Do you realize that I cannot collect any taxes at all from half the provinces in the Empire? They're still part of the Empire-`Hail the Imperium! -`All honor to the Emperor'-but they don't pay anything and I don't have the necessary force to collect it. And if I can't get the credits out of them, they are not really part of the Empire, are they?</p><p>“不，还是想想信用点吧。你可了解，我无法从帝国半数的星省收到任何税金？它们仍是帝国的一部分，‘皇权万岁！’，‘所有荣耀归于吾皇！’可是它们什么税也不缴，而我又没有足够的力量征收。如果我不能从它们那里得到信用点，它们其实就不算帝国的一部分，对不对？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Credits! The Empire runs a chronic deficit of appalling proportions. There's nothing I can pay for. Do you think there is enough funding to maintain the Imperial Palace grounds? Just barely. I must cut corners. I must let the Palace decay. I must let the number of retainers die down by attrition.</p><p>“信用点！帝国出现长期财政赤字，数额大得吓人，我什么费用都付不出来。你以为我有足够的经费维修皇宫御苑吗？勉强而已。我不得不省吃俭用，不得不让宫殿腐朽，不得不靠着自然折损来减少侍从的人数。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Professor Seldon. If you want credits, I have nothing. Where will I find appropriations for the Library? They should be grateful I manage to squeeze out something for them each year at all." As he finished, the Emperor held out his hands, palms up, as if to signify the emptiness of the Imperial coffers.</p><p>“谢顿教授，如果你要信用点，我半点也没有。我要去哪里为那座图书馆找经费？我每年还能设法挤出一点给他们，他们就该感激涕零了。”说完之后，皇帝伸出双手，手掌向上，仿佛表示帝国国库空空如也。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon was stunned. He said, "Nevertheless, Sire, even if you lack the credits, you still have the Imperial prestige. Can you not order the Library to allow me to keep my office and let my colleagues in to help me with our vital work?"</p><p>哈里·谢顿大吃一惊。“然而，陛下，纵使您欠缺信用点，您仍然拥有皇帝的威望。难道您不能命令该馆保留我的研究室，并让我的同事进驻，帮助我进行极重要的研究工作吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now Agis XIV sat down again as though, once the subject was not credits, he was no longer in a state of agitation.</p><p>此时艾吉思十四世重新坐了下来，仿佛一旦话题离开信用点，他就不再处于心慌意乱的状态。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "You realize that, by long tradition, the Galactic Library is independent of the Imperium, as far as its self-government is concerned. It sets up its rules and has done so since Agis VI, my namesake"-he smiled……"attempted to control the news functions of the Library. He failed and, if the great Agis VI failed, do you think I can succeed?"</p><p>他说：“你该了解，根据悠久的传统，就自治权而言，帝国图书馆独立于皇权之外。自从那位和我同名号的艾吉思六世试图控制该馆的新闻功能，”他微微一笑，“它便开始订定自己的法规。既然伟大的艾吉思六世都失败了，你认为我能成功吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not asking you to use force, Sire. Merely expressing a polite wish. Surely, when no vital function of the Library is involved, they will be pleased to honor the Emperor and oblige his wishes."</p><p>“我不是要求陛下用强，您只要表达一个客气的意愿就好。不用说，只要不牵涉到该馆的重要功能，他们会乐意礼遇皇帝，迁就皇帝的旨意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Professor Seldon, how little you know of the Library. I have but to express a wish, however gently and tentatively, to make it certain that they will proceed, in dudgeon, to do the opposite. They are very sensitive to the slightest sign of Imperial control."</p><p>“谢顿教授，你对那座图书馆知道得太少。我只要表达一个意愿，不论多么温和，多么心虚，都能确定他们一定会怒气冲冲地反其道而行。对于皇权控制的任何迹象，他们可是非常敏感。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Then what do I do?"</p><p>谢顿说：“那我该怎么办？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, I'll tell you what. A thought occurs to me. I am a member of the public and I can visit the Galactic Library if I wish. It is located on the Palace grounds, so I won't be violating protocol if I visit it. Well, you come with me and we shall be ostentatiously friendly. I will not ask them for anything, but if they note us walking arm-in-arm, then perhaps some of the precious Board of theirs may feel more kindly toward you than otherwise. -But that's all I can do."</p><p>“啊，我告诉你该怎么办，我刚想到一个法子。我也是公众的一员，只要我喜欢，我也可以造访帝国图书馆。它坐落于御苑内，因此我的造访并不会违反规范。所以说，你和我一起去，我们将表现得十分热络。我不会对他们做任何要求，但他们若注意到我们手牵手走在一起，那么说不定他们那个了不起的评议会，有些成员便会觉得对你好点总是好的——但那是我唯一能做的了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And the deeply disappointed Seldon wondered if that could possibly be enough.</p><p>而深深失望的谢顿，则怀疑那样做有没有足够的作用。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>12</p><p>12</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Las Zenow said with a certain trace of awe in his voice, "I didn't know you were so friendly with the Emperor, Professor Seldon."</p><p>拉斯·齐诺声音中带着几分敬畏说：“我不知道您和皇帝陛下这么熟络，谢顿教授。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? He's a very democratic fellow for an Emperor and he was interested in my experiences as a First Minister in Cleon's time."</p><p>“有何不可？就一位皇帝而言，他是非常民主的。而且，他对我在克里昂时代担任首相的经验很感兴趣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It made a deep impression on us all. We haven't had an Emperor in our halls for many years. Generally, when the Emperor needs something from the Library……"</p><p>“这令我们大家都留下深刻印象，已经好多年没有皇帝驾临我们的大厅。一般说来，当皇帝陛下需要图书馆中什么资料……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can imagine. He calls for it and it is brought to him as a matter of courtesy."</p><p>“我可以想象。他下个传召，便会有人送去给他，这代表对他的礼遇。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There was once a suggestion," said Zenow chattily, "that the Emperor be outfitted with a complete set of computerized equipment in his palace, hooked directly into the Library system, so that he would not need to wait for service. This was in the old days when credits were plentiful, but, you know, it was voted down."</p><p>“过去曾有人建议，”齐诺滔滔不绝地说，“为皇帝在皇宫中装设一套完整的电脑化设备，直接联到图书馆系统，这样他就无需等待。那时还是信用点丰足的年头，但是，您可知道，结果却被否决了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Was it?"</p><p>“是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh yes, almost the entire Board agreed that it would make the Emperor too much a part of the Library and that this would threaten our independence from the government."</p><p>“喔，是的。评议会几乎一致认为，那将使皇帝对本馆涉入太深，会威胁到我们独立于政府的地位。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And does this Board, which will not bend to honor an Emperor, consent to let me remain at the Library?"</p><p>“而这个评议会，这个甚至不愿过分礼遇皇帝的评议会，同意让我留在馆里吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"At the present moment, yes. There is a feeling-and I've done my best to encourage it-that if we are not polite to a personal friend of the Emperor, the chance of a rise in appropriations will be gone altogether, so……"</p><p>“目前这个时候，答案是肯定的。大家普遍有一种感觉，而我也尽全力助长这种感觉，那就是我们若不善待皇帝的私交，增加预算的机会将完全消失，所以……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So credits-or even the dim prospect of credits-talk."</p><p>“所以信用点，甚至是信用点的模糊影子，比什么都有分量。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm afraid so."</p><p>“只怕就是如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And can I bring in my colleagues?"</p><p>“那我能不能带我的同事进来？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zenow looked embarrassed. "I'm afraid not. The Emperor was seen walking only with you-not with your colleagues. I'm sorry, Professor."</p><p>齐诺显得有些尴尬。“只怕不行。我们只看到皇帝陛下和您走在一起，没有看到您的同事。我很抱歉，教授。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shrugged and a mood of deep melancholy swept over him. He had no colleague to bring in, anyhow. For some time he had hoped to locate others like Wanda and he had failed. He, too, would need funding to mount an adequate search. And he, too, had nothing.</p><p>谢顿耸了耸肩，一股深沉的忧郁袭上心头。反正，他也没有什么同事能带进来。过去曾有一段时间，他希望找到其他类似婉达的人，结果他失败了。他同样需要经费，才能展开足够彻底的搜寻，而他同样没有任何经费。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>13</p><p>13</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trantor, the capital world-city of the Galactic Empire, had changed considerably since the day Hari first stepped off the hypership from his native Helicon thirty-eight years ago. Was it the pearly haze of an old man's memory that made the Trantor of old shine so brightly in his mind's eye, Hari wondered. Or perhaps it had been the exuberance of youth-how could a young man from a provincial Outer World such as Helicon not be impressed by the gleaming towers, sparkling domes, the colorful, rushing masses of people that had seemed to swirl through Trantor, day and night.</p><p>哈里·谢顿走出从母星赫利肯飞来的超空间飞船，首度踏上川陀的土地，已经是三十八年前的事。这些年来，川陀这个银河帝国的首都世界，发生了许多可观的变化。谢顿不禁纳闷，是不是一个老人记忆中璀璨的迷雾，让昔日的川陀在他印象中显得特别辉煌。或者，也许是由于年少的热情——一个年轻人来自像赫利肯那样偏僻的外围世界，怎能不折服于那些闪闪发亮的尖塔、光芒耀眼的穹顶，以及五彩缤纷、几乎日夜川流不息的人潮。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, Hari thought sadly, the walkways are nearly deserted, even in the full light of day. Roving gangs of thugs controlled various areas of the city, competing among themselves for territory. The security establishment had dwindled; those who were left had their hands full processing complaints at the central office. Of course, security officers were dispatched as emergency calls came through, but they made it to the scene only after a crime was committed-they no longer made even a pretense of protecting the citizens of Trantor. A person went out at his own risk-and a great risk it was. And yet Hari Seldon still took that risk, in the form of a daily walk, as if defying the forces that were destroying his beloved Empire to destroy him as well.</p><p>如今，谢顿悲伤地想到，即使在大白天，人行道也几乎空无一人。流浪街头的凶徒组成许多帮派，控制着城市各个地区，并不时为争夺地盘而火并。保安部门已经萎缩，留下来的人都在中央办公室全力处理各种控诉。当然，在收到紧急讯号时，保安官仍会被派出来，但他们一律在案发之后才抵达现场，甚至不再装模作样地保护川陀居民。外出的人得自己承担风险，而且是极大的风险。但是哈里·谢顿仍在冒这种险，他每天总会步行一段路程，仿佛在向那些邪恶的力量挑战。那些力量虽然即将摧毁他所热爱的帝国，他却不容许它们摧毁自己。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so Hari Seldon walked along, limping-and thoughtful.</p><p>因此，这时哈里·谢顿正在漫步，步子有点跛，脑子则陷入沉思。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nothing worked. Nothing. He had been unable to isolate the genetic pattern that set Wanda apart-and without that, he was unable to locate others like her.</p><p>毫无进展，各方面都毫无进展。他一直无法分离出使婉达与众不同的遗传配型，而做不到这一点，他就无法找到与她类似的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda's ability to read minds had sharpened considerably in the six years since she had identified the flaw in Yugo Amaryl's Prime Radiant. Wanda was special in more ways than one. It was as if, once she realized that her mental ability set her apart from other people, she was determined to understand it, to harness its energy, to direct it. As she had progressed through her teen years, she had matured, throwing off the girlish giggles that had so endeared her to Hari, at the same time becoming even dearer to him in her determination to help him in his work with the powers of her "gift." For Hari Seldon had told Wanda about his plan for a Second Foundation and she had committed herself to realizing that goal with him.</p><p>自从婉达指出雨果·阿马瑞尔的元光体中出现瑕疵，这六年来，她透视心灵的能力敏锐了许多倍。此外，婉达在另外一些方面也颇不寻常。仿佛一旦察觉到她的精神能力使她与众不同，她便决心要了解它的奥秘，要驾驭它的力量，要指挥它的功能。这几年间，十几岁的她逐渐成熟，过去令谢顿钟爱异常的那种孩子气的吃吃笑声，如今早已听不到了。然而，由于她决心利用“天赋”帮助他进行研究，他因而更加珍视她。哈里·谢顿已将第二基地的计划告诉婉达，而她则已立志献身这项计划，要和他共同实现这个目标。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Today, though, Seldon was in a dark mood. He was coming to the conclusion that Wanda's mentalic ability would get him nowhere. He had no credits to continue his work-no credits to locate others like Wanda, no credits to pay his workers on the Psychohistory Project at Streeling, no credits to set up his all-important Encyclopedia Project at the Galactic Library.</p><p>不过，谢顿今天情绪十分阴郁。他逐渐得到一项结论，那就是婉达的精神能力无法对他提供任何帮助。他没有信用点继续研究工作——没有信用点付给斯璀璘大学心理史学计划的工作人员，没有信用点在帝国图书馆中创设那个重要无比的百科全书计划，也没有信用点来寻找类似婉达的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now what?</p><p>现在该怎么办？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He continued to walk toward the Galactic Library. He would have been better off taking a gravicab, but he wanted to walk-limp or not. He needed time to think.</p><p>他继续朝帝国图书馆走去。其实搭乘重力计程车会比较好，但他就是要步行，不论是否跛脚，他需要利用这段时间来思考。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He heard a cry……"There he is!"-but paid no attention.</p><p>他听到有人喊道：“他在那里！”可是并未留意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It came again. "There he is! Psychohistory!"</p><p>接着又传来一声：“他在那里！心理史学！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The word forced him to look up. -Psychohistory.</p><p>“心理史学”这几个字令他不禁抬起头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A group of young men was closing in around him.</p><p>一群年轻人正向他围过来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Automatically Seldon placed his back against the wall and raised his cane. "What is it you want?"</p><p>谢顿自然而然背靠墙壁，并举起手杖。“你们想要什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They laughed. "Credits, old man. Do you have any credits?"</p><p>他们哈哈大笑。“要信用点，老头，你有信用点吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Maybe, but why do you want them from me? You said, `Psychohistory!' Do you know who I am?"</p><p>“也许有，但你们为什么要我的信用点？你们刚才在喊‘心理史学！’你们知道我是谁吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure, you're Raven Seldon" said the young man in the lead. He seemed both comfortable and pleased.</p><p>“当然，你就是乌鸦嘴谢顿。”领头那个年轻人说，他似乎又得意又高兴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're a creep," shouted another.</p><p>“你是个讨厌鬼。”另一人叫道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What are you going to do if I don't give you any credits?"</p><p>“如果我不给你们任何信用点，你们会怎么做？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll beat you up," said the leader, "and we'll take them."</p><p>“我们会揍你一顿，”领头那人说，“然后自己动手拿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And if I give you my credits?"</p><p>“如果我把信用点通通给你们呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll beat you up anyway!" They all laughed.</p><p>“我们横竖都会揍你一顿！”众人一起哈哈大笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon raised his cane higher. "Stay away. All of you."</p><p>哈里·谢顿将手杖举高一点。“别过来，你们都别过来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By now he had managed to count them. There were eight.</p><p>现在他总算把他们数了一遍，总共有八个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He felt himself choking slightly. Once he and Dors and Raych had been attacked by ten and they had had no trouble. He had been only thirty-two at the time and Dors-was Dors.</p><p>他觉得有点透不过气来。很久以前，曾有十个人围攻他与铎丝，他俩却应付自如。当时他只有三十二岁，而铎丝——铎丝就是铎丝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now it was different. He waved his cane.</p><p>现在情况完全不同，他开始挥动手杖。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The leader of the hoodlums said, "Hey, the old man is going to attack us. What are we going to do?"</p><p>那群小流氓的头头说：“嘿，这老头要攻击我们，我们要怎么办？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked around swiftly. There were no security officers around. Another indication of the deterioration of society. An occasional person or two passed by, but there was no use calling for help. Their footsteps increased in speed and made a wide detour. No one was going to run any risks of getting involved in an imbroglio.</p><p>谢顿迅速环顾四周。附近没有保安官，这是社会衰败的另一项征兆。偶尔有一两个人经过，可是呼救根本没用。他们都加快步伐，而且绕了很大的弯，没有人要冒险卷入一场纷争。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "The first one of you who approaches gets a cracked head."</p><p>谢顿说：“你们谁先凑近，谁的脑袋先开花。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yeah?" And the leader stepped forward rapidly and seized the cane. There was a short sharp struggle and the cane was wrested from Seldon's grip. The leader tossed it to one side.</p><p>“是吗？”那头头快步向前走去，抓住那根手杖。经过短暂的激烈挣扎，谢顿紧握的手杖被抢走了，那头头随手将它丢到一边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now what, old man?"</p><p>“现在怎么样，老头？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shrunk back. He could only wait for the blows. They crowded around him, each eager to land a blow or two. Seldon lifted his arms to try to ward them off. He could still Twist-after a fashion. If he were facing only one or two, he might be able to Twist his body, avoid their blows, strike back. But not against eight-surely not against eight.</p><p>谢顿开始退缩，他只能等着挨打了。他们围在他身边，每个人都急着落下一两拳。谢顿则举起双臂，试图挡开他们。他还勉强能施展些角力，假使他面对的只有一两个人，他或许能闪躲腾挪，避开他们的拳头，并且伺机反击。但对付八个人则不行，他当然对付不了八个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He tried, at any rate, moving quickly to one side to avoid the blows and his right leg, with its sciatica, doubled under him. He fell and knew himself to be utterly helpless.</p><p>无论如何，为了躲避攻击，他还是试着迅速挪向一侧。但由于坐骨神经痛作祟，右腿直不起来。他跌倒在地，明白自己完全一筹莫展了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then he heard a stentorian voice shouting, "What's going on here? Get back, you thugs! Back or I'll kill you all!"</p><p>然后，他听见一个洪亮的声音喊道：“这里发生什么事？退下，你们这些凶徒！否则我把你们通通杀掉！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The leader said, "Well, another old man."</p><p>那头头说：“好啊，又来个老头。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not that old," said the newcomer. With the back of one hand, he struck the leader's face, turning it an ugly red.</p><p>“没那么老。”那人说完，便用手背击向那头头的脸部，把他的脸打得又红又肿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said in surprise, "Raych, it's you."</p><p>谢顿惊叫道：“芮奇，是你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych's hand swept back. "Stay out of this, Dad. Just get up and move away."</p><p>芮奇向后挥了挥手。“你别管了，爸。赶快站起来，离开这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The leader, rubbing his cheek, said, "We'll get you for that."</p><p>那头头一面揉着脸颊，一面说：“我们会要你付出代价。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, you won't," said Raych, drawing out a knife of Dahlite manufacture, long and gleaming. A second knife was withdrawn and he now held one in each hand.</p><p>“不，你们不会。”芮奇抽出一把达尔制的刀子，刀身又长又亮。接着他又抽出一把，然后用双手握着双刀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said weakly, "Still carrying knives, Raych?"</p><p>谢顿虚弱地说：“还带着刀啊，芮奇？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Always," said Raych. "Nothing will ever make me stop."</p><p>“永远带着。”芮奇说，“没有任何因素能阻止我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'll stop you," said the leader, drawing out a blaster.</p><p>“我会阻止你。”那头头一面说，一面掏出一柄手铳。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Faster than the eye could follow, one of Raych's knives went sailing through the air and struck the leader's throat. He made a loud gasp, then a gurgling sound, and fell, while the other seven stared.</p><p>说时迟那时快，芮奇手中的一把刀凌空飞出，转瞬间便插入那头头的喉部。那人发出一下响亮的喘息，然后是一阵咯咯声，接着他便仆倒在地，另外七个人看得目瞪口呆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych approached and said, "I want my knife back." He drew it out of the hoodlum's throat and wiped it on the man's shirtfront. In doing so, he stepped on the man's hand, bent down, and picked up his blaster.</p><p>芮奇欺近他，说道：“我要收回我的刀。”他从那小流氓的喉部抽出刀来，还在他的衬衣前胸处擦了擦。与此同时，他踩住那人的右手，弯下腰，拾起了他的手铳。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych dropped the blaster into one of his capacious pockets. He said, "I don't like to use a blaster, you bunch of good-for-nothings, because sometimes I miss. I never miss with a knife, however. Never! That man is dead. There are seven of you standing. Do you intend to stay standing or will you leave?"</p><p>芮奇将手铳塞进他的一个宽大口袋中。“你们这伙废物听着，我不喜欢用手铳，因为有时会失手。然而，我用刀从没失过手，从来没有！那个人已经死了，现在你们站着的还有七个。你们是打算继续站着，还是赶紧离去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Get him!" shouted one of the hoodlums and the seven made a concerted rush.</p><p>“抓住他！”其中一个小流氓说，于是七个人一齐向前冲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych took a backward step. One knife flashed and then the other and two of the hoodlums stopped with, in each case, a knife buried in his abdomen.</p><p>芮奇退了一步。两把刀一前一后如闪电般刺出，其中两个小流氓便煞住脚步，每人腹部插了一把刀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Give me back my knives," said Raych, pulling each out with a cutting motion and wiping them.</p><p>“把我的刀还给我。”芮奇说完，便连拔带切，将双刀收回来，顺手擦了擦刀身。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"These two are still alive, but not for long. That leaves five of you on your feet. Are you going to attack again or are you going to leave?"</p><p>“这两个还活着，但活不了多久。现在没躺下的还剩你们五个，你们是要再度发动攻击，还是要离开这里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They turned and Raych called out, "Pick up your dead and dying. I don't want them."</p><p>他们刚一转身，芮奇便喊道：“把这些死了的和快死的抬走，我可不要留着。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hastily they flung the three bodies over their shoulders, then they turned tail and ran.</p><p>他们匆匆忙忙把死伤的同伴担在肩上，然后夹着尾巴逃之夭夭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych bent to pick up Seldon's cane. "Can you walk, Dad?"</p><p>芮奇弯下腰来，捡起谢顿的手杖。“你还能走吗，爸？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not very well," said Seldon. "I twisted my leg."</p><p>“不太行，”谢顿说，“我扭伤了一条腿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then, get into my car. What were you doing walking, anyway?"</p><p>“好吧，那么上我的车。怎么搞的，你干吗要走路？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? Nothing's ever happened to me."</p><p>“有何不可？我以前从没遇到任何事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So you waited till something did. Get into my car and I'll give you a lift back to Streeling."</p><p>“所以你一直等着遇到点什么。上我的车吧，我送你回斯璀璘。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He programmed the ground-car quietly, then said, "What a shame we didn't have Dors with us. Mom would have attacked them with her bare lands and left all eight dead in five minutes."</p><p>他默默设定好地面车的路径，然后说：“真可惜铎丝不在场，妈可以赤手空拳对付他们，五分钟内让八个都变成死人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt tears stinging his eyelids. "I know, Raych, I know. Do you think I don't miss her every day?"</p><p>谢顿觉得泪水刺痛了眼睑。“我知道，芮奇，我知道。你以为我没有时时刻刻怀念她吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm sorry," said Raych in a low voice.</p><p>“真抱歉。”芮奇低声说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon asked, "How did you know I was in trouble?"</p><p>谢顿问道：“你怎么晓得我有麻烦？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda told me. She said there were evil people lying in wait for you ,slid told me where they were and I took right off."</p><p>“婉达告诉我的。她说会有邪恶的人在路上等着你，还告诉我在哪里，于是我立刻动身。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Didn't you doubt that she knew what she was talking about?"</p><p>“你肯定她清楚自己在说些什么吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not at all. We know enough about her now to know that she has some sort of contact with your mind and with the things around you."</p><p>“一点也不。现在我们对她已有足够的了解，知道她和你的心灵以及你周遭的事物有某种接触。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Did she tell you how many people were attacking me?"</p><p>“她可曾告诉你有多少人攻击我？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. She just said, `Quite a few.'"</p><p>“没有，她只是说‘可不少’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So you came out all by yourself, did you, Raych?"</p><p>“而你就自己一个人来，是吗，芮奇？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I had no time to put together a posse, Dad. Besides, one of me was enough."</p><p>“我没时间组织一队人马，爸。何况，我一个就够了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, it was. Thank you, Raych."</p><p>“是的，没错。谢谢你，芮奇。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>14</p><p>14</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were back at Streeling now and Seldon's leg was stretched out on a hassock.</p><p>现在他们回到了斯璀璘，谢顿将右腿伸在一个跪垫上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych looked at him somberly. "Dad," he began, "you're not to go walking around Trantor on your own from now on."</p><p>芮奇以忧郁的眼神望着他。“爸，”他开口道，“从现在起，不准你单独一人在川陀闲逛。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon frowned. "Why, because of one incident?"</p><p>谢顿皱起眉头。“为什么，就因为一次意外？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was enough of an incident. You can't take care of yourself any longer. You're seventy years old and your right leg will not support you in an emergency. And you have enemies……"</p><p>“一次意外就够了。你再也不能自己照顾自己，你已经七十岁了，而且在紧急状况下，你的右腿不听使唤。何况你还有许多敌人……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Enemies!"</p><p>“许多敌人！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, indeed. And you know it. Those sewer rats were not after simply anyone. They were not looking for just any unwary person to rip off. They identified you by calling out, `Psychohistory!' And they called you a creep. Why do you suppose that was?"</p><p>“一点都没错，你自己心里明白。那些街头鼠辈并不是任意找个对象，并不是随便找个落单的人打劫。他们大叫‘心理史学！’以确定你的身份，而且他们叫你讨厌鬼。你猜那是为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know why."</p><p>“我不知道为什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's because you live in a world all your own, Dad, and you don't know what's going on on Trantor. Don't you suppose the Trantorians know that their world is going downhill at a rapid rate? Don't you suppose they know that your psychohistory has been predicting this for years? Doesn't it occur to you that they may blame the messenger for the message? If things go bad-and they are going bad-there are many who think that you are responsible for it."</p><p>“那是因为你活在一个完全属于自己的世界，爸，你不知道川陀发生了什么变化。你难道以为川陀人不晓得他们的世界正在迅速走下坡吗？你难道以为他们不晓得你的心理史学多年来都在预测这一点吗？你难道没想到，他们有可能因为预言而责怪预言者吗？如果一切越来越糟——事实也正是如此——会有许多人认为你该为此负责。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can't believe that."</p><p>“我无法相信这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why do you suppose there's a faction at the Galactic Library that wants you out of there? They don't want to be in the way when you are mobbed. So-you've got to take care of yourself. You can't go out alone. I'll have to be with you or you will have to have bodyguards. That's the way it's going to be, Dad."</p><p>“帝国图书馆有一派人想要把你赶出去，你以为是为什么？他们不想在你被暴民围攻时，遭到池鱼之殃。所以说，你必须懂得自己照顾自己。你不能再单独外出，我一定得跟着你，或者你一定得有些保镖。以后必须这样做才行，爸。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked dreadfully unhappy.</p><p>谢顿显得极不高兴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych softened and said, "But not for long, Dad. I've got a new job.'</p><p>芮奇随即软化，又说：“但不会太久的，爸，我找到了一个新工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked up. "A new job. What kind?"</p><p>谢顿抬起头来。“新工作，什么样的工作？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Teaching. At a University."</p><p>“教书，在一所大学教书。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Which University? "</p><p>“哪一所大学？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Santanni.</p><p>“圣塔尼。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon's lips trembled. "Santanni! That's nine thousand parsecs away from Trantor. It's a provincial world on the other side of the Galaxy."</p><p>谢顿双唇打战。“圣塔尼！它是位于银河另一侧的一个偏僻世界，距离川陀有九千秒差距之远。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly. That's why I want to go there. I've been on Trantor all my life, Dad, and I'm tired of it. There's no world in all the Empire that's deteriorating the way Trantor is. It's become a haunt of crime with no one to protect us. The economy is limping, the technology is failing. Santanni, on the other hand, is a decent world, still humming along, and I want to be there to build a new life, along with Manella and Wanda and Bellis. We're all going there in two months."</p><p>“完全正确，那正是我要到那里去的原因。我这辈子都待在川陀，爸，我已经厌倦了。如今在整个帝国中，没有任何世界像川陀这样迅速衰落。它已经变成罪犯的巢穴，没有人能保护我们。而且这里经济疲软、科技衰退。另一方面，圣塔尼则是个不错的世界，仍然欣欣向荣。我要去那里建立新生活，带着玛妮拉、婉达和贝莉丝一块走，我们两个月后就要动身。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"All of you!"</p><p>“你们全都走？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you, Dad. And you. We wouldn't leave you behind on Trantor. You're coming with us to Santanni."</p><p>“还有你，爸，还有你。我们不会把你留在川陀，你要和我们一块到圣塔尼去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "Impossible, Raych. You know that."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“不可能，芮奇，你知道的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why impossible?"</p><p>“为什么不可能？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You know why. The Project. My psychohistory. Are you asking me to abandon my life's work?"</p><p>“你知道为什么。为了谢顿计划，为了我的心理史学。你是要我放弃毕生的工作吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? It's abandoned you."</p><p>“有何不可？它已经放弃你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're mad."</p><p>“你疯了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I'm not. Where are you going with it? You have no credits. You can't get any. There's no one left on Trantor who's willing to support you."</p><p>“不，我没有。你死守着它能怎么样？你没有信用点，你找不到任何财源，川陀上已经没有人愿意支持你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For nearly forty years……"</p><p>“将近四十年的岁月……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I admit that. But after all that time, you've failed Dad. There's no crime in failing. You've tried so hard and you've gone so far, but you've run into a deteriorating economy, a falling Empire. It's the very thing you've been predicting for so long that's stopping you at last. So……"</p><p>“没错，这点我承认。但经营了这么多年，你终究是失败了，爸。失败没什么罪过，你曾经这么努力，你已经获得这么多成果，但你遇到的是个逐渐恶化的经济，是个逐渐衰亡的帝国。最后阻止你继续前进的，正是你多年来所预测的事。所以说……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. I will not stop. Somehow or other, I will keep going."</p><p>“不，我不会停止。不管用什么方法，我总要继续下去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I tell you what, Dad. If you're really going to be so stubborn, then take psychohistory with you. Start it again on Santanni. There may be enough credits-and enthusiasm-to support it there."</p><p>“我告诉你怎么办，爸。如果你真要那么固执，那就带着心理史学一起走，到圣塔尼另起炉灶。那里也许有足够的信用点，以及足够的热忱支持这项计划。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And the men and women who have been working for me so faithfully?"</p><p>“那些忠心耿耿追随我的男男女女又怎么办？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh bull, Dad. They've been leaving you because you can't pay them. You hang around here for the rest of your life and you'll be alone. -Oh, come on, Dad. Do you think I like to talk to you this way? It's because no one has wanted to-because no one has had the heart to-that you're in your present predicament. Let's be honest with each other now. When ~. Ñu walk the streets of Trantor and you're attacked for no reason other than that you're Hari Seldon, don't you think it's time for a little bit of truth?"</p><p>“喔，算了吧，爸。他们一个接一个走了，因为你无法支付他们薪水。要是把余生耗在这里，你将会孤苦伶仃。喔，走吧，爸。你以为我喜欢这样和你说话吗？那是因为没人愿意这样做，因为没人有这个胆告诉你，说你已经陷入困境。现在让我们彼此开诚布公——当你走在川陀街头，竟然会只因为你是哈里·谢顿而遭到攻击，难道你不认为应该稍微面对现实了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Never mind the truth. I have no intention of leaving Trantor."</p><p>“别管现实不现实，我可不打算离开川陀。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych shook his head. "I was sure you'd be stubborn, Dad. You've got two months to change your mind. Think about it, will you?"</p><p>芮奇摇了摇头。“我料到你会很固执，爸。你有两个月的时间改变心意，好好想一想，好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>15</p><p>15</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It had been a long time since Hari Seldon had smiled. He had conducted the Project in the same fashion that he always did: pushing always forward in the development of psychohistory, making plans for the Foundation, studying the Prime Radiant.</p><p>哈里·谢顿已有好长一段时间未曾露出笑容。他仍旧一切如常地主持谢顿计划：继续推动心理史学的发展，为基地拟定方案，此外就是研究元光体。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But he did not smile. All he did was to force himself through his work without any feeling of impending success. Rather, there was a feeling of impending failure about everything.</p><p>但是他不再露出笑容。他所做的只是强迫自己投入工作，却没有任何成功在望的感觉。反之，他倒是感觉一切皆已濒临失败。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now, as he sat in his office at Streeling University, Wanda entered. He looked up at her and his heart lifted. Wanda had always been special. Seldon couldn't put his finger on just when he and the others had started accepting her pronouncements with more than the usual enthusiasm; it just seemed always to have been that way. As a little girl, she had saved his life with her uncanny knowledge of "lemonade death" and all through her childhood she had somehow just known things.</p><p>现在，他坐在斯璀璘大学自己的研究室中，婉达突然走了进来。他抬头望向她，觉得精神为之一振。婉达一向十分特殊——虽然谢顿无法明确指出他（以及其他人）何时开始以异常认真的态度接受她的见解；在他的印象中，似乎向来就是如此。她还是小女孩的时候，便以奇妙的方式获悉“柠檬水之死”，因而救了他一命。此外在她的童年时期，她始终有办法知道许多事情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Although Dr. Endelecki had asserted that Wanda's genome was perfectly normal in every way, Seldon was still positive that his granddaughter possessed mental abilities far beyond those of average humans. And he was just as sure that there were others like her in the Galaxy-on Trantor, even. If only he could find them, these mentalics, what a great contribution they could make to the Foundation. The potential for such greatness all centered in his beautiful granddaughter. Seldon gazed at her, framed in his office doorway, and he felt as if his heart would break. In a few days, she would be gone.</p><p>虽然恩德勒斯基医师断定婉达的基因组在各方面完全正常，谢顿仍确信这个孙女拥有远远超乎常人的精神力量。此外他同样确定，在银河系中，甚至在川陀上，还有其他类似婉达的人存在。假使他能找到他们，找到这些精神异人，他们将对“基地”作出莫大的贡献。如此的伟业能否成真，全系于这位美丽的孙女身上。谢顿凝望着站在研究室门口的她，感到自己仿佛柔肠寸断。再过几天，她就要走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How could he bear it? She was such a beautiful girl-eighteen. Long blond hair, face a little broad but with a tendency to smile. She was even smiling now and Seldon thought, Why not? She's heading for Santanni and for a new life.</p><p>他怎能承受这种打击？她是如此美丽的一个女孩——十八岁，一头长长的金发，稍嫌宽阔的脸庞时时带着笑容。即使现在她仍然笑容满面，谢顿转念一想：有何不可？她即将前往圣塔尼，投入一个崭新的生活。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "Well, Wanda, just a few more days."</p><p>他说：“好啊，婉达，只剩几天了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. I don't think so, Grandpa."</p><p>“不，我可不这么想，爷爷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He stared at her. "What?"</p><p>他定睛望着她。“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda approached him and put her arms around him. "I'm not going to Santanni."</p><p>婉达向他凑近，伸出双臂环抱他。“我不准备去圣塔尼。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have your father and mother changed their minds?"</p><p>“你父母亲改变了心意？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, they're going."</p><p>“不，他们还是要去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you're not? Why? Where are you going?"</p><p>“而你不去？为什么？那你要去哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm going to stay here, Grandpa. With you." She hugged him. "Poor Grandpa!"</p><p>“我要留在这里，爷爷，陪着你。”她紧紧抱住他，“可怜的爷爷！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I don't understand. Why? Are they allowing this?"</p><p>“可是我不懂。为什么呢？他们准你这样做吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You mean Mom and Dad. Not really. We've been arguing over this for weeks, but I've won out. Why not, Grandpa? They'll go to Santanni and they'll have each other-and they'll have little Bellis, too. But if I go with them and leave you here, you'll have no one. I don't think I could stand that."</p><p>“你是说爸妈，并不尽然。我们为这件事争论了好几个星期，但我已经赢了。有何不可呢，爷爷？他们要去圣塔尼，他们将拥有彼此，而且他们还有小贝莉丝。但我要是也跟他们去，把你留在这里，你就什么人也没有了。我想我狠不下这个心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But how did you get them to agree?"</p><p>“但你是怎么让他们同意的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, you know-I pushed."</p><p>“这个嘛，你该知道——我推他们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p>“那是什么意思？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's my mind. I can see what you have in yours and in theirs and, as time goes on, I can see more clearly. And I can push them to do what I want."</p><p>“用我的心灵。我看得到你心里想些什么，还有他们想些什么。这些年来，我看得越来越清楚。而且，我能推动他们去做我所希望的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How do you do that?"</p><p>“你怎么做到的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know. But after a while, they get tired of being pushed and they're willing to let me have my way. So I'm going to stay with you."</p><p>“我也不知道。但一段时间后，他们被推烦了，便愿意让我照自己的意思去做，所以我会留在这里陪你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked up at her with helpless love. "This is wonderful, Wanda. But Bellis……"</p><p>谢顿抬头望着她，心中忍不住充满爱怜。“那太好了，婉达。可是贝莉丝……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't worry about Bellis. She doesn't have a mind like mine."</p><p>“别担心贝莉丝，她没有像我这样的心灵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you certain?" Seldon chewed at his lower lip.</p><p>“你确定吗？”谢顿咬住下唇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quite certain. Besides, Mom and Dad have to have someone, too."</p><p>“相当确定。何况，爸妈也得有个伴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon wanted to rejoice, but he couldn't do so openly. There were Raych and Manella. What of them?</p><p>谢顿想要高声欢呼，但他不能公然这样做，他必须顾到芮奇与玛妮拉。他们会怎么想呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "Wanda, what about your parents? Can you be so cold-blooded about them?"</p><p>他说：“婉达，你的双亲怎么办？你能对他们这么冷酷无情吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not cold-blooded. They understand. They realize I must be with you."</p><p>“我不是冷酷无情，他们了解的。他们明白我必须和你在一起。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How did you manage that?"</p><p>“你是如何设法做到的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I pushed," said Wanda simply, "and eventually they came to see it my way.</p><p>“我推他们，”婉达轻描淡写地说，“最后他们终于能用我的观点看待这件事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You can do that?"</p><p>“你做得到这点？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It wasn't easy."</p><p>“那并不容易。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you did it because……" Seldon paused.</p><p>“而你这样做是因为……”谢顿打住了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said, "Because I love you. Of course. And because……"</p><p>婉达说：“当然，是因为我爱你。还有就是……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes?"</p><p>“什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I must learn psychohistory. I know quite a bit of it already."</p><p>“我必须学习心理史学，我对它已有不少认识。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How?"</p><p>“从哪儿学来的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"From your mind. From the minds of others at the Project, especially from Uncle Yugo before he died. But it's in rags and tatters, so far. I want the real thing. Grandpa, I want a Prime Radiant of my own." Her face lit up and her words came quickly, with passion. "I want to study psychohistory in great detail. Grandpa, you're quite old and quite tired. I'm young and eager. I want to learn all I can, so I can carry on when……"</p><p>“从你的心灵，从谢顿计划其他成员的心灵，尤其是从当年的雨果叔叔那里。但目前为止，都只是零零星星。我要学真正的东西，爷爷，我要一个自己的元光体。”她满面红光，话说得又快又热情，“我要详详细细研究心理史学。爷爷，你年纪相当大了，而且相当疲倦。我还年轻，而且有冲劲。我要尽可能学习一切，以便将来能继续……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Well, that would be wonderful-if you could do it-but there is no funding anymore. I'll teach you all I can, but-we can't do anything."</p><p>谢顿说：“好啊，如果你能这么做，那实在太好了。但我们再也没有任何经费，我会尽可能教你，可是，我们什么也不能做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll see, Grandpa. We'll see."</p><p>“我们等着瞧，爷爷，我们等着瞧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>16</p><p>16</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych, Manella, and little Bellis were waiting at the spaceport.</p><p>芮奇、玛妮拉与小贝莉丝在太空航站等待启程。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The hypership was preparing for liftoff and the three had already checked their baggage.</p><p>超空间飞船正在作升空准备，他们三人的行李已经托运好了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "Dad, come along with us."</p><p>芮奇说：“爸，跟我们走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "I cannot."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“我做不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you change your mind, we will always have a place for you."</p><p>“如果你改变心意，我们家永远欢迎你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know it, Raych. We've been together for almost forty years-and they've been good years. Dors and I were lucky to find you."</p><p>“我知道，芮奇。我们相处了将近四十年，这是一段美好的时光，遇到你是铎丝和我的运气。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm the lucky one." His eyes filled with tears. "Don't think I don't think of Mother every day."</p><p>“幸运的是我。”他的双眼充满泪水，“别以为我没天天想到母亲。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes." Seldon looked away miserably. Wanda was playing with Bellis when the call rang out for everyone to board the hypership.</p><p>“是啊。”谢顿悲痛地别过头去。当登船召唤响起时，婉达还在和贝莉丝玩耍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They did, after a tearful last embrace of Wanda by her parents. Raych looked back to wave at Seldon and to try to plant a crooked smile on his face.</p><p>婉达的父母含泪与她做最后的拥抱，便随众人走向飞船。芮奇还回过头来向谢顿挥手，脸上硬挤出一个扭曲的笑容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon waved and one hand moved out blindly to embrace Wanda's shoulders.</p><p>谢顿抬头挥着手，另一只手则摸索着婉达的肩头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was the only one left. One by one through his long life, he had lost his friends and those he had loved. Demerzel had left, never to return; Emperor Cleon was gone; his beloved Dors was gone; his faithful friend Yugo Amaryl was gone; and now Raych, his only son, was gone as well.</p><p>她是唯一留下来的了。在他漫长的一生中，他的朋友与他所爱的人一个个离他而去。丹莫刺尔离开了，再也没有回来；克里昂大帝走了；他挚爱的铎丝走了；他忠实的朋友雨果·阿马瑞尔走了。现在，他的独子芮奇也走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was left only with Wanda.</p><p>他身边只剩下了婉达。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>17</p><p>17</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon said, "It is beautiful outside-a marvelous evening. Considering that we live under a dome, you would think we would have beautiful weather like this every evening."</p><p>哈里·谢顿说：“外面真是美丽，好一个难得的黄昏。既然我们住在穹顶之下，每个黄昏都应该是像这么美好的天气。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said indifferently, "We would grow tired of it, Grandpa, if it were beautiful all the time. A little change from night to night is good for us."</p><p>婉达淡然地说：“如果总是那么美丽，爷爷，那我们一定会生厌。每晚有些小小的变化，对我们是好的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For you, because you're young, Wanda. You have many, many evenings ahead of you. I don't. I want more good ones."</p><p>“对你是好的，因为你还年轻，婉达，你还有很多很多个黄昏。我可不同，我希望多些美好的日子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now, Grandpa, you're not old. Your leg is doing well and your mind m as sharp as ever. I know. "</p><p>“好啦，爷爷，你还不老。你的右腿情况不错，你的心灵敏锐如昔，我都知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure. Go ahead. Make me feel better." He then said with an air of discomfort, "I want to walk. I want to get out of this tiny apartment and take a walk to the Library and enjoy this beautiful evening."</p><p>“的确。继续说，让我感觉舒服点。”然后，他带着不自在的神态说：“我想出去走走，我想离开这间窄小的公寓，散步到帝国图书馆，享受一下这个美好的黄昏。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What do you want at the Library?"</p><p>“你要到那座图书馆做什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"At the moment, nothing. I want the walk. -But……"</p><p>“此时此刻，什么也不做。我只是想走走，可是……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. But?"</p><p>“嗯，可是？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I promised Raych I wouldn't go walking around Trantor without a bodyguard."</p><p>“我对芮奇承诺过，要是没有保镖，我不会在川陀闲逛。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Raych isn't here."</p><p>“芮奇不在这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know," mumbled Seldon "but a promise is a promise."</p><p>“我知道，”谢顿喃喃地说，“但承诺总是承诺。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He didn't say who the bodyguard should be, did he? Let's go for a walk and I'll be your bodyguard "</p><p>“他并没说该由谁担任保镖，对不对？我们去散散步吧，我来当你的保镖。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You?" Seldon grinned.</p><p>“你？”谢顿咧嘴笑了笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, me. I hereby volunteer my services. Get yourself ready and we'll go for a walk."</p><p>“是的，我，我自愿提供这项服务。你准备一下，我们这就去走走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was amused. He had half a mind to go without his cane, since his leg was scarcely painful of late, but, on the other hand, he had a new cane, one in which the head had been filled with lead. It was both heavier and stronger than his old cane and, if he was going to have none other than Wanda as a bodyguard, he thought he had better bring his new cane.</p><p>谢顿被逗乐了。他有些不想带手杖出去，因为他的右腿近来几乎不痛了。但是，另一方面，他换了一根新手杖，杖头灌了铅，比原来那根更沉重、更坚固。倘若他只能有婉达这位保镖，他认为最好还是带着那根新手杖。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The walk was delightful and Seldon was terribly glad he had given in to the temptation-until they reached a certain spot.</p><p>这趟漫步相当愉快，谢顿万分高兴自己未能抗拒这个诱惑。直到他们走到某个地方——</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon lifted his cane in a mixture of anger and resignation and said, "Look at that!"</p><p>谢顿突然在愤怒与灰心交杂的情绪中举起手杖，说道：“看看那里！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda lifted her eyes. The dome was glowing, as it always did in the evening, in order to lend an air of first twilight. It grew darker as night went on, of course.</p><p>婉达扬起目光。正如每个黄昏一样，穹顶正放出光芒，以制造薄暮的气氛。当然，随着夜色渐深，它就会逐渐变暗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What Seldon was pointing at, however, was a strip of darkness along the dome. A section of lights had gone out.</p><p>然而谢顿所指的，则是穹顶上的一条暗带。换句话说，有一段灯光消失了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "When I first came to Trantor, anything like that was unthinkable. There were people tending the lights at all times. The city worked, but now it is falling apart in all these little ways and what bothers me most is that no one cares. Why aren't there petitions to the Imperial Palace? Why aren't there meetings of indignation? It is as though the people of Trantor expect the city to be falling apart and then they find themselves annoyed with me because I am pointing out that this is exactly what is happening."</p><p>谢顿说：“我刚到川陀的时候，这种事是不可思议的。当年随时有人维护那些灯泡，整个城市都在运作。可是现在，它在这些小节上开始四分五裂，而最令我烦恼的是根本没人在乎。为什么见不到向皇宫请愿的活动？为什么没有义愤填膺的集会？就好像川陀人民指望着这座城市逐渐瓦解，然后又迁怒到我身上，因为我指出这正是如今在发生的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said softly, "Grandpa, there are two men behind us."</p><p>婉达轻声道：“爷爷，我们后面有两个人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They had walked into the shadows beneath the broken dome lights and Seldon asked, "Are they just walking?"</p><p>这个时候，他们已经走进故障的穹顶灯光所形成的阴影。谢顿问道：“他们只是路过吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No." Wanda did not look at them. She did not have to. "They're after you "</p><p>“不，”婉达并未望向他们，她不必那么做，“他们在跟踪你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Can you stop them-push them?"</p><p>“你能阻止他们吗？推走他们？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm trying, but there are two and they are determined. It's-it's like pushing a wall."</p><p>“我在尝试，但对方有两个人，而且他们很坚决。这就像——就像在推一堵墙。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How far behind me are they?"</p><p>“他们在我后面多远？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"About three meters."</p><p>“大约三公尺。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Closing in?"</p><p>“逐渐接近？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Grandpa."</p><p>“是的，爷爷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Tell me when they're a meter behind me." He slid his hand down his cane till he was holding the thin end, leaving the leaded head swinging free.</p><p>“等他们来到我身后一公尺，就赶紧告诉我。”他的手沿着手杖往下滑，最后握住手杖的尖端，让灌铅的那头自由摇摆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now, Grandpa!" hissed Wanda.</p><p>“来了，爷爷！”婉达悄声道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Seldon turned, swinging his cane. It came down hard upon the shoulder of one of the men behind him, who went down with a scream, writhing on the pavement.</p><p>谢顿立即转身，并挥动他的手杖。杖头重重落在其中一人的肩膀上，那人发出一声尖叫，倒在人行道上拼命翻滚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Where's the other guy?"</p><p>谢顿说：“另外那家伙呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He took off."</p><p>“他跑掉了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked down on the man on the ground and put his foot on his chest. He said, "Go through his pockets, Wanda. Someone must have paid him and I'd like to find his credit file-perhaps I can identify where they came from." He added thoughtfully, "I meant to hit him on the head "</p><p>谢顿低头望着地上那个人，并用脚踩住他的胸部。“搜他全身的口袋，婉达。一定有人付他一笔信用点，我要找出他的信用档案，说不定我能认出他们是哪一路的。”他又若有所思地说，“我本来想打他的头。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You'd have killed him, Grandpa."</p><p>“那会要他的命，爷爷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded. "It's what I wanted to do. Rather shameful. I'm lucky I missed."</p><p>谢顿点了点头。“说来惭愧，那正是我想要做的。所幸我没打中。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A harsh voice said, "What is all this?" A figure in uniform came running up, perspiring. "Give me that cane, you!"</p><p>一个刺耳的声音突然响起：“这是怎么回事？”接着，一个穿着制服的人满头大汗地跑过来。“你，把那根手杖给我！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Officer," said Seldon mildly.</p><p>“保安官。”谢顿和气地唤道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You can give me your story later. We've got to call an ambulance for this poor man."</p><p>“你有话可以待会儿再对我说，我们得先帮这个可怜人召救护车。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Poor man, " said Seldon angrily. "He was going to assault me. I acted in self-defense."</p><p>“可怜人！”谢顿气呼呼地说，“他正准备攻击我，我的行动是自卫。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I saw it happen," said the security officer. "This guy never laid a finger on you. You turned on him and struck him without provocation. That's not self-defense. That's assault and battery."</p><p>“我看到整个经过，”那名保安官说，“这人并未伸出一根指头碰你。你突然转过身来，毫无来由就给他一棍。那不是自卫，那是蓄意伤害。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Officer, I'm telling you that……"</p><p>“保安官，我告诉你……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't tell me anything. You can tell it in court."</p><p>“什么也别告诉我，有话可以在法庭讲。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said in a sweet small voice, "Officer, if you will just listen to us……"</p><p>婉达以甜美轻柔的声音说：“保安官，只要你能听我们说几句……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The officer said, "You go along home, young lady."</p><p>那保安官说：“你快回家去，小姐。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda drew herself up. "I most certainly won't, Officer. Where my grandfather goes, there go I." Her eyes flashed and the security officer muttered, "Well, come along, then."</p><p>婉达站了起来。“我绝不会那么做，保安官。我祖父去哪里，我就跟去哪里。”在她闪烁的目光下，保安官喃喃道：“好吧，那就一块走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>18</p><p>18</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was enraged. "I've never been in custody before in my entire life. A couple of months ago eight men assaulted me. I was able to fight them off with the help of my son, but while that was going on was there a security officer in sight? Did people stop to help me? No. This time, I'm better prepared and I knocked a man flat who had been about to assault me. Was there a security officer in sight? Absolutely. She put the collar on me. There were people watching, too, and they were amused at seeing an old man being taken in for assault and battery. What kind of world do we live on?"</p><p>谢顿暴跳如雷。“我这一辈子，还从来没有被拘留过。几个月前，有八个人袭击我，在我儿子的帮助下，我才有办法打退他们，可是那个时候，附近看得见一个保安官吗？有人前来助我一臂之力吗？没有。这次，我有备而来，我把一个准备袭击我的人打倒在地。附近看得见一个保安官吗？不但看得见，她还将我逮捕。一旁还有路人围观，他们乐得看到一个老头因蓄意伤害罪被带走。我们活在一个什么样的世界？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Civ Novker, Seldon's lawyer, sighed and said calmly, "A corrupt world, but don't worry. Nothing will happen to you. I'll get you out on bail and then, eventually, you'll come back for trial before a jury of your peers and the most you'll get-the very most-are some hard words from the bench. Your age and your reputation……"</p><p>谢顿的律师西夫·诺夫可叹了一口气，再以平静的口吻说：“一个败坏的世界。但是不用担心，你不会有事的，我会把你保释出来。然后，你终将回到这里，在你的同侪所组成的陪审团前接受审判。而最重的刑罚——最重不过的——也只是法官申斥你几句而已。你的年纪和你的名望……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Forget my reputation," said Seldon, still angry. "I'm a psychohistorian and, at the present time, that is a dirty word. They'll be glad to see me in jail."</p><p>“别提我的什么名望。”谢顿仍在气头上，“我是个心理史学家，而如今这个年头，心理史学可是肮脏的字眼，他们会乐于见到我坐牢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, they won't," said Novker. "There may be some screwballs who have it in for you, but I'll see to it that none of them gets on the jury."</p><p>“不，他们不会。”诺夫可说，“也许有些偏激人士对你怀恨在心，但我绝不会让这种人进入陪审团。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said, "Do we really have to subject my grandfather to all this? He's not a young man anymore. Can't we just appear before the magistrate and not bother with a jury trial?"</p><p>婉达说：“我们真的得让我祖父经历这一切吗？他已不再年轻。我们能不能光是去见治安官，而省去一场陪审团审判？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The lawyer turned to her. "It can be done. If you're insane, maybe. Magistrates are impatient power-mad people who would just as soon put a person into jail for a year as listen to him. No one goes up before a magistrate."</p><p>律师转向她。“可以做得到，假如你疯了，或许可以这样做。治安官都是大权在握而毫无耐心的人，他们宁可随便判个一年徒刑，也不愿意听被告的陈述。没有人会想去见治安官。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think we should," said Wanda.</p><p>“我想我们应该去。”婉达道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Well now, Wanda, I think we ought to listen to Civ……" But as he said that, he felt a strong churning in his abdomen. It was Wanda's "push." Seldon said, "Well-if you insist."</p><p>谢顿说：“好啦，婉达，我想我们该听西夫……”但他刚说到这里，便觉得腹部一阵强烈的激荡，那是婉达在“推”他。于是谢顿改口道：“好吧，如果你坚持。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She can't insist," said the lawyer. "I won't allow it."</p><p>“她不能坚持，”律师说，“我不会允许这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said, "My grandfather is your client. If he wants something done his way, you've got to do it."</p><p>婉达说：“我祖父是你的委托人，如果他要某件事照他的意思做，你就得那样做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can refuse to represent him."</p><p>“我可以拒绝他的委托。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then, leave," said Wanda sharply, "and we'll face the magistrate alone."</p><p>“好啊，那么请便。”婉达以尖锐的口气说，“我们会单独面对治安官。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Novker thought and said, "Very well, then-if you're going to be so adamant. I've represented Hari for years and I suppose I won't abandon him now. But I warn you, the chances are he'll get a jail sentence and I'll have to work like the devil to get it lifted-if I can do it .at all."</p><p>诺夫可想了一想。“那么，好吧，既然你这么固执己见。我担任哈里的法律代表好多年了，我想我不能在这个时候遗弃他。但是我要警告你，他被判入狱的机会十之八九，到时候我得费九牛二虎之力寻求赦免——假使我办得到的话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not afraid," said Wanda.</p><p>“我可不怕。”婉达说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon bit his lip and the lawyer turned to him. "What about you? Are you willing to let your granddaughter call the shots?"</p><p>谢顿咬着嘴唇，此时律师又转向他。“你怎么说？你愿意让你的孙女做主吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon thought a bit, then admitted, much to the old lawyer's surprise, "Yes. Yes, I am."</p><p>谢顿想了一下，然后大大出乎老律师的意料之外，他答道：“愿意，我愿意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>19</p><p>19</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate looked sourly at Seldon as he gave his story.</p><p>当谢顿进行陈述时，治安官没好气地望着他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate said, "What makes you think it was the intention of this man you struck to attack you? Did he strike you? Did he threaten you? Did he in any way place you under bodily fear?"</p><p>治安官说：“你怎么会认为你打倒的那个人有攻击你的意图？他打你了吗？他威胁你了吗？他有没有以任何方式令你感到身处险境？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My granddaughter was aware of his approach and was quite certain that he was planning to attack me."</p><p>“我孙女察觉到他向我迫近，而且相当确定他打算攻击我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely, sir, that cannot be enough. Is there anything else you can tell me before I pass judgment?"</p><p>“不用说，老先生，这点绝对不够。在我宣判之前，你还有任何事能告诉我吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well now, wait a while," said Seldon indignantly. "Don't pass judgment so quickly. I was assaulted a few weeks ago by eight men whom I held off with the help of my son. So, you see, I have reason to think that I might be assaulted again."</p><p>“好吧，慢着，”谢顿忿忿不平地说，“别那么快就宣判。几个星期前，我遭到八个人袭击，结果我儿子帮我打退他们。所以说，您看，我有理由认为可能再度受到袭击。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate shuffled his papers. "Assaulted by eight men. Did you report that?"</p><p>治安官随手翻了翻文件。“遭到八个人袭击，你报案了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There were no security officers around. Not one."</p><p>“当时附近没有保安官，一个也没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Aside from the point. Did you report it?"</p><p>“答非所问，你报案了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, sir."</p><p>“没有，大人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?"</p><p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For one thing, I was afraid of getting into long drawn-out legal proceedings. Since we had driven off eight men and were safe, it seemed useless to ask for more trouble."</p><p>“原因之一，我怕卷入冗长的法律程序。既然我们把八个人赶走了，自身又安然无事，再找其他麻烦似乎毫无意义。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How did you manage to ward off eight men just you and your son?"</p><p>“就你和你儿子，你们怎么有办法抵挡八个人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon hesitated. "My son is now on Santanni and outside Trantorian control. Thus, I can tell you that he had Dahlite knives and was expert in their use. He killed one man and badly hurt two others. The rest ran, carrying off the dead and wounded."</p><p>谢顿迟疑了一下。“我儿子如今在圣塔尼，不在川陀管辖范围。所以我能告诉您，他带着两把达尔长刀，而且他是用刀的行家。那天他杀了其中一人，并且重伤另外两个，其他人便带着死伤的同伴跑了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But did you not report the death of a man and the wounding of two others?"</p><p>“但你并没有为这次的死伤报案备查？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, sir. Same reason as before. And we fought in self-defense. However, if you can track down the three dead and wounded, you will have evidence that we were attacked."</p><p>“没有，大人，理由和刚才说的一样，而且我们是自卫伤人。然而，如果您能查出那三名死伤者，您就有了我们遭到攻击的证据。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate said, "Track down one dead and two wounded nameless faceless Trantorians? Are you aware that on Trantor over two thousand people are found dead every day-by knife wounds alone. Unless these things are reported to us at once, we are helpless. Your story of being assaulted once before will not hold water. What we must do is deal with the events of today, which were reported and which had a security officer as a witness.</p><p>治安官说：“追查一死两伤、三个无名无姓的川陀人？你晓不晓得光是刀伤身亡的，川陀上每天便能发现超过两千具尸首？这种事除非立即接到报案，否则我们一筹莫展。你曾经遭到袭击的这项陈述，完全不足以采信。现在我们必须做的，是审理今天这个事件。有人替它报了案，还有一名保安官作证。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So, let's consider the situation as of now. Why do you think the fellow was going to attack? Simply because you happened to be passing by? Because you seemed old and defenseless? Because you looked like you might be carrying a great deal of credits? What do you think?"</p><p>“所以说，让我们单单考虑目前这个状况。你为何认定那个人准备攻击你？只因为你刚好路过？因为你似乎年老而无力抵抗？因为你像是可能携带大笔信用点？你究竟是怎么想的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think, Magistrate, it was because of who I am."</p><p>“我想，治安官，是因为我的身份。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate looked at his papers. "You are Hari Seldon, a professor and a scholar. Why should that make you subject to assault, particularly?"</p><p>治安官看了看面前的文件。“你是哈里·谢顿，是个教授和学者。这点为何会让你特别成为袭击的对象？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because of my views."</p><p>“因为我的观点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Your views. Well……" The magistrate shuffled some papers perfunctorily. Suddenly he stopped and looked up, peering at Seldon. "Wait-Hari Seldon." A look of recognition spread across his face. "You're the psychohistory buff, aren't you?"</p><p>“你的观点。嗯……”治安官草率地翻了翻几份文件。突然间他停止了动作，抬起头来凝视着谢顿。“慢着——哈里·谢顿。”他脸上浮现出熟识的神情，“你就是那个研究心理史学的，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Magistrate."</p><p>“是的，治安官。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm sorry. I don't know anything about it except the name and the fact that you go around predicting the end of the Empire or something like that."</p><p>“很抱歉，我对它毫无认识。我只知道它叫这个名字，以及你到处发表预言，说些帝国末日即将来临之类的话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not quite, Magistrate. But my views have become unpopular because they are proving to be true. I believe it is for that reason that there are those who want to assault me or, even more likely, are being paid to assault me."</p><p>“并不尽然，治安官。但我的观点已经变得不受欢迎，因为事实逐渐证明它们都是真的。我相信正是由于这个缘故，因此有人想要袭击我，更有可能是受雇袭击我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate stared at Seldon and then called over the arresting security officer. "Did you check up on the man who was hurt? Does he have a record?"</p><p>治安官瞪了谢顿一会儿，然后叫来逮捕谢顿的那名保安官。“你有没有查过受伤那人的身份？他有没有前科？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The security officer cleared her throat. "Yes, sir. He's been arrested several times. Assault, mugging."</p><p>女保安官清了清喉咙。“有的，大人。他被逮捕过好几次，罪名是袭击和箍颈。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, he's a repeat offender, is he? And does the professor have a record?"</p><p>“喔，那么他是累犯了？这位教授有没有前科呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, sir."</p><p>“没有，大人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So we have an old and innocent man fighting off a known mugger-and you arrest the old and innocent man. Is that it?"</p><p>“所以这件案子，是一位无辜的老人击退一个有前科的箍颈党。而你却逮捕了这位无辜的老人，是不是这样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The security officer was silent.</p><p>保安官哑口无言。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate said, "You may go, Professor."</p><p>治安官说：“你可以走了，教授。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you, sir. May I have my cane?"</p><p>“谢谢您，大人。我能拿回我的手杖吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The magistrate snapped his fingers at the officer, who handed over the cane.</p><p>治安官对保安官弹了一下手指，后者便将手杖交给了谢顿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But one thing, Professor," said the magistrate. "If you use that cane again, you had better be absolutely certain you can prove it was in self-defense. Otherwise……"</p><p>“可是要记住一件事，教授。”治安官说，“倘若你再要用那根手杖，最好绝对确定你能证明那是自卫行为。否则……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, sir." And Hari Seldon left the magistrate's chambers, leaning heavily on his cane but with his head held high.</p><p>“是的，大人。”哈里·谢顿离开了治安官的审判厅，他的身体笨拙地倚在手杖上，但他的头抬得很高。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>20</p><p>20</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda was crying bitterly, her face wet with tears, her eyes red, her cheeks swollen.</p><p>婉达哭得极凄苦，她的脸蛋沾满泪水，双眼通红，双颊也肿了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon hovered over her, patting her on the back, not knowing quite how to comfort her.</p><p>哈里·谢顿高高站在她身旁，轻拍着她的背，不知如何安慰她才好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandpa, I'm a miserable failure. I thought I could push people and I could when they didn't mind being pushed too much, like Mom and Dad-and even then it took a long time. I even worked out a rating system of sorts, based on a ten-point scale-sort of a mental pushing power gauge. Only I assumed too much. I assumed that I was a ten, or at least a nine. But now I realize that, at most, I rate a seven."</p><p>“爷爷，我是个悲惨的输家。我以为我能推动他人——只要他们不介意被推动太多，像爸妈那样，我就推得动，可是即使那样，也得花好长一段时间。我甚至设计出一种评量系统，分成十个等级，可以说是个‘心灵推力计’。只不过我太高估自己了，我假定自己是十级，或者至少是九级。可是现在我才明白，我顶多只有七级。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda's crying had stopped and she sniffed occasionally as Hari stroked her hand. "Usually-usually-I have no trouble. If I concentrate, I can hear people's thoughts and when I want, I push them. But those muggers! I could hear them all right, but there was nothing I could do to push them away."</p><p>婉达已经停止哭泣，谢顿轻抚着她的手，她偶尔还是会抽噎一下。“通常……通常……我都没问题。如果我全神贯注，就能听见人们的思想，还能任意推动他们。可是那些箍颈党！我确实听得见他们，但我怎么也没办法把他们推走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I thought you did very well, Wanda."</p><p>“我认为你做得非常好，婉达。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I didn't. I had a fan-fantasy. I thought people would come up behind you and in one mighty push I'd send them flying. That way I was going to be your bodyguard. That's why I offered to be your bod-bodyguard. Only I wasn't. Those two guys came up and I couldn't do a thing."</p><p>“我没有。我曾有个幻……幻想，我以为当别人来到你身后，只要我用力一推，便能让他们飞走。这样我就可以当你的保镖，而那正是我自告奋勇当你的保……保镖的原因。不料我办不到，那两个家伙走过来，我却一点办法也没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But you could. You made the first man hesitate. That gave me a chance to turn and clobber him."</p><p>“可是你真有办法啊。你令第一个人迟疑不决，让我有机会转身击倒他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No no. I had nothing to do with it. All I could do was warn you he was there and you did the rest."</p><p>“不，不。那和我一点关系也没有，我能做的只是警告你，其他都是你自己做的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The second man ran away."</p><p>“第二个人则跑了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because you clobbered the first guy. I had nothing to do with it." She broke out again in tears of frustration. "And then the magistrate. I insisted on the magistrate. I thought I would push and he would let you go at once."</p><p>“因为你击倒了头一个，那和我一点关系也没有。”她突然流下挫折的泪水，“还有那个治安官。我坚持要见治安官，因为我以为自己能推动他，让他立刻放你走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He did let me go and it was practically at once."</p><p>“他的确放我走了，而且几乎是立刻释放。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. He put you through a miserable routine and saw the light only when he realized who you were. I had nothing to do with it. I flopped everywhere. I could have gotten you into so much trouble."</p><p>“不。他毫不通融地对你公事公办，直到发觉你是谁，他才恍然大悟，那和我一点关系也没有。我处处碰壁，差点给你惹了大麻烦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I refuse to accept that, Wanda. If your pushing didn't work quite as well as you had hoped it would, it was only because you were working under emergency conditions. You couldn't have helped it. But, Wanda, look-I have an idea."</p><p>“不，我拒绝相信这点，婉达。若说你的推力不如你所希望的那么有效，那只是因为你身处紧急状况，令你身不由己。可是，婉达，听着——我想到一个主意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Catching the excitement in his voice, she looked up. "What kind of idea, Grandpa?"</p><p>婉达听出他声音中的兴奋之情，马上抬起头来。“什么样的主意，爷爷？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, it's like this, Wanda. You probably realize that I've got to have credits. Psychohistory simply can't continue without it and I cannot bear the thought of having it all come to nothing after so many years of hard work."</p><p>“这个嘛，事情是这样的，婉达，你或许了解我必须筹得信用点。若是没有经费，心理史学简直无法继续下去。经过这么多年的辛苦，倘若一切成为泡影，我可经不起这种打击。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can't bear it, either. But how can we get the credits?"</p><p>“我也经不起。可是我们怎样才能筹得信用点呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, I'm going to request an audience with the Emperor again. I've seen him once already and he's a good man and I like him. But he's not exactly drowning in wealth. However, if I take you with me and if you push him-gently-it may be that he will find a source of credits, some source somewhere, and keep me going for a while, till I can think of something else."</p><p>“这个嘛，我准备再次求见皇帝陛下。我已经见过他一次，他是个好人，我很喜欢他，可是他并非富可敌国。然而，如果我带你跟我一起去，如果你推他一下，轻轻推一下，说不定他就会从哪里找到财源，好让我再撑一阵子，直到我能想到别的办法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you really think it will work, Grandpa?"</p><p>“你真认为这样行得通吗，爷爷？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not without you. But with you-maybe. Come, isn't it worth trying?"</p><p>“没有你绝不行，可是有了你，也许就可以。来吧，难道不值得试试吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda smiled. "You know I'll do anything you ask, Grandpa. Besides, it's our only hope."</p><p>婉达微微一笑。“你知道的，爷爷，你要我做什么我都肯。何况，那是我们唯一的希望。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>21</p><p>21</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not difficult to see the Emperor. Agis's eyes sparkled as he greeted Hari Seldon. "Hello, old friend," he said. "Have you come to bring me bad luck?"</p><p>求见皇帝陛下并不困难。当艾吉思迎接哈里·谢顿时，他的双眼闪烁着光芒。“嗨，老友，”他说，“你是要给我带来坏运吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I hope not," said Seldon.</p><p>“我希望不是。”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Agis unhooked the elaborate cloak he was wearing and, with a weary grunt, threw it into the corner of the room, saying, "And you lie there."</p><p>艾吉思解开穿在身上的精致披风，疲倦地哼了一声，将它丢到房间的一角，并说：“你，给我躺在那里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked at Seldon and shook his head. "I hate that thing. It's as heavy as sin and as hot as blazes. I always have to wear it when I'm being smothered under meaningless words, standing there upright like a carved image. It's just plain horrible. Cleon was born to it and he had the appearance for it. I was not and I don't. It's just my misery that I'm a third cousin of his on my mother's side so that I qualified as Emperor. I'd be glad to sell it for a very small sum. Would you like to be Emperor, Hari?"</p><p>他望向谢顿，摇了摇头。“我恨那玩意，它像原罪一样沉重，像地狱之火一样烫人。当我像雕像般笔直地站着，接受胡言乱语的疲劳轰炸时，我总是得穿着它。简直可恶透顶！克里昂生来如此，而且他有帝王气派，我却不是，也没气派。我只是不幸生为他的第三个表弟，所以有资格当皇帝。我很乐意以非常低的价钱把它卖掉，你想不想当皇帝啊，哈里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No no, I wouldn't dream of it, so don't get your hopes up," said Seldon, laughing.</p><p>“不，不，不，我不会做那个梦，所以您别抱太大希望。”谢顿哈哈大笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But tell me, who is this extraordinarily beautiful young woman you have brought with you today?"</p><p>“可是你得告诉我，今天跟你来的这位美丽非凡的少女是谁？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda flushed and the Emperor said genially, "You mustn't let me embarrass you, my dear. One of the few perquisites an Emperor possesses is the right to say anything he chooses. No one can object or argue :bout it. They can only say, `Sire.' However, I don't want any `Sires' from you. I hate that word. Call me Agis. That is not my birth name, either. It's my Imperial name and I've got to get used to it. So……tell me what's doing, Hari. What's been happening to you since the last time we met?"</p><p>婉达面红耳赤，皇帝则和蔼地说：“你绝不能被我说得脸红，亲爱的。皇帝所拥有的少数特权之一，就是口无遮拦的权利。没有人能反对或提出异议，他们只能连呼‘陛下’。然而，我不要从你口中听到任何‘陛下’，我痛恨这两个字。叫我艾吉思，虽然那也不是我真正的名字。它是我的帝号，而我不得不习惯它。所以……告诉我近况如何，哈里。我们上次见面后，你又经历了些什么事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said briefly, "I've been attacked twice."</p><p>谢顿简单地说：“我两度受到攻击。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor didn't seem to be sure whether this was a joke or not. He said, "Twice? Really?"</p><p>皇帝似乎不确定这是不是一句笑话。他说：“两度？真的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor's face darkened as Seldon told the story of the assaults. "I suppose there wasn't a security officer around when those eight men threatened you."</p><p>当谢顿叙述遭到袭击的经过时，皇帝的脸沉了下来。“我想，那八个人胁迫你的时候，附近没有任何保安官吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not one."</p><p>“一个也没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor rose from his chair and gestured at the other two to keep theirs. He walked back and forth, as though he were trying to work off some anger. Then he turned and faced Seldon.</p><p>皇帝从座椅中站起来，并对两人做个手势，示意他们继续坐着。他开始来回踱步，仿佛试图驱除若干怒气。然后，他又转身面对谢顿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For thousands of years," he began, "whenever something like this happened, people would say, `Why don't we appeal to the Emperor?' or `Why doesn't the Emperor do something?' And, in the end, the Emperor can do something and does do something, even if it isn't always the intelligent thing to do. But I……Hari, I'm powerless. Absolutely powerless.</p><p>“几千年来，”他开口道，“不论何时发生这类事件，人们都会说，‘我们何不去向皇帝诉愿？’或是‘皇帝为何不做点什么？’最后，皇帝的确能做点什么，也的确做了点什么，即使并非总是明智之举。可是我……哈里，我没有权力，完全没有权力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh yes, there is the so-called Commission of Public Safety, but they seem more concerned with my safety than that of the public. It's a wonder we're having this audience at all, for you are not at all popular with the Commission.</p><p>“喔，是啊，是有个所谓的公共安全委员会，但他们较关心的似乎只是我的安全，而不是公共安全。今天我们能见面都算是奇迹，因为你绝不受委员会的欢迎。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There's nothing I can do about anything. Do you know what's happened to the status of the Emperor since the fall of the junta and the restoration of-hah!-Imperial power?"</p><p>“我对任何事都束手无策。你可知道，自从执政团垮台，复辟——哈！复辟了皇权后，皇帝的地位发生了什么变化？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think I do."</p><p>“我想我知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'll bet you don't-fully. We've got democracy now. Do you know what democracy is?"</p><p>“我敢打赌你不知道——不全知道。现在我们有民主了，你晓得民主是什么吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Certainly."</p><p>“当然。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Agis frowned. He said, "I'll bet you think it's a good thing."</p><p>艾吉思皱起眉头。“我敢打赌你认为它是件好事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think it can be a good thing."</p><p>“我认为它可以是件好事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, there you are. It isn't. It's completely upset the Empire.</p><p>“看，你果然这么说。不是那么回事，它把帝国完全颠覆了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Suppose I want to order more officers onto the streets of Trantor. In the old days, I would pull over a piece of paper prepared for me by the Imperial Secretary and would sign it with a flourish-and there would be more security officers.</p><p>“假设我要命令更多保安官站到川陀街头去，在过去的年头，我只要抽出一张御用秘书为我准备的公文纸，在上面龙飞凤舞地签个名，便会出现更多的保安官。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now I can't do anything of the sort. I have to put it before the Legislature. There are seventy-five hundred men and women who instantly turn into uncounted gaggles of geese the instant a suggestion is made. In the first place, where is the funding to come from? You can't have, say, ten thousand more officers without having to pay ten thousand more salaries. Then, even if you agreed to something of the sort, who selects the new security officers? Who controls them?</p><p>“现在我却不能做这种事，我得把它送交立法院。当我提出一项建议后，七千五百位男女委员随即变成咯咯叫的一大群鹅。首要的问题是，经费从哪里来？你多找比如说一万名保安官，就不能不多付一万份薪水。此外，即使你同意这种事，又要由谁挑选新的保安官？由谁控制他们？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Legislature shouts at each other, argues, thunders, and lightens, and in the end-nothing is done. Hari, I couldn't even do as small a thing as fix the broken dome lights you noticed. How much will it cost? Who's in charge? Oh, the lights will be fixed, but it can easily take a few months to do it. That's democracy."</p><p>“立法委员彼此叫嚣，争论，闹得不可开交，最后——一事无成。哈里，你提到穹顶灯光故障，我甚至连修理灯泡这点小事都做不到。那要花费多少？由谁负责？喔，灯泡总是会修好的，但很容易拖上几个月。这，就是民主。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon said, "As I recall, the Emperor Cleon was forever complaining that he could not do what he wished to do."</p><p>哈里·谢顿说：“我还记得，克里昂大帝始终在抱怨不能做自己希望做的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Emperor Cleon," said Agis impatiently, "had two first-class First Ministers-Demerzel and yourself-and you each labored to keep Cleon from doing anything foolish. I have seventy-five hundred First Ministers, all of whom are foolish from start to finish. But surely, Hari, you haven't come to complain to me about the attacks."</p><p>“克里昂大帝，”艾吉思不耐烦地说，“曾拥有两位一流的首相，丹莫刺尔和你自己，你们两人努力不使克里昂做任何傻事。而我则有七千五百位首相，他们通通从头傻到尾。不过，哈里，你来找我，当然不是向我抱怨受到攻击这桩事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I haven't. Something much worse. Sire-Agis-I need credits."</p><p>“没错，不是的。我是为了更糟许多倍的事而来，陛下——艾吉思——我需要信用点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor stared at him. "After what I've been telling you, Hari? I have no credits. -Oh yes, there're credits to run this establishment, of course, but in order to get them I have to face my seventy-five hundred legislators. If you think I can go to them and say, `I want credits for my friend, Hari Seldon' and if you think I'll get one quarter of what I ask for in anything less than two years, you're crazy. It won't happen."</p><p>皇帝瞪着他。“我和你讲了那么多，你还提出这种要求，哈里？我没有信用点——喔，没错，我当然有信用点维持这个局面，但是为了得到这笔钱，我得面对我的七千五百位立法委员。假如你认为我能去找他们，对他们说：‘我要些信用点给我的朋友哈里·谢顿。’假如你认为我能在两年内，得到我所要的四分之一，那你就是疯了。绝不会有这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He shrugged and said, more gently, "Don't get me wrong, Hari. I would like to help you if I could. I would particularly like to help you for the sake of your granddaughter. Looking at her makes me feel as though I should give you all the credits you would like-but it can't be done."</p><p>他耸了耸肩，再以较温和的口吻说：“别误会我，哈里。假使我有办法，我很愿意帮助你。尤其是看在你孙女的份上，我特别愿意帮助你。看着她就令我有一种感觉，仿佛你要多少信用点我都该给你，可是根本办不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Agis, if I don't get funding, psychohistory will go down the drain-after nearly forty years."</p><p>谢顿说：“艾吉思，倘若我得不到经费，心理史学将永无翻身之日——在努力了将近四十年之后。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's come to nothing in nearly forty years, so why worry?"</p><p>“努力了将近四十年，什么成果也没有，所以又何必操心呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Agis," said Seldon "there's nothing more I can do now. The assaults on me were precisely because I'm a psychohistorian. People consider me a predictor of destruction."</p><p>“艾吉思，”谢顿说，“如今我再也不能做什么了。我之所以受到袭击，正因为我是心理史学家，人们将我视为毁灭的预言者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor nodded. "You're bad luck, Raven Seldon. I told you this earlier."</p><p>皇帝点了点头。“你就是噩运，乌鸦嘴谢顿，我早就告诉过你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon stood up wretchedly. "I'm through, then."</p><p>谢顿凄惶地站起来。“那么，我告退了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda stood, too, next to Seldon the top of her head reaching her grandfather's shoulder. She gazed fixedly at the Emperor.</p><p>婉达也已起身，站在谢顿旁边，定睛望着这位皇帝，她的头刚好与祖父的肩膀同高。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As Hari turned to go, the Emperor said, "Wait. Wait. There's a little verse I once memorized:</p><p>正当谢顿转身离去时，皇帝又说：“慢着，慢着。我曾经背诵过一首小诗：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I'll fares the land</p><p>‘大地如猎物，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To hastening ills a prey</p><p>连连灾祸似狼虎，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Where wealth accumulates</p><p>财富累积之地，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And men decay.' "</p><p>唯见人心衰腐。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What does it mean?" asked a dispirited Seldon.</p><p>“那是什么意思？”垂头丧气的谢顿问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It means that the Empire is steadily deteriorating and falling apart, but that doesn't keep some individuals from growing rich. Why not turn to some of our wealthy entrepreneurs? They don't have legislators and can, if they wish, simply sign a credit voucher."</p><p>“它的意思是说，帝国虽然一步步走向衰落和分裂，但某些人仍然可能越来越有钱。何不去找那些富有的企业家试试呢？他们没有立法委员，只要他们愿意，随手就能签一张信用点券给你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon stared. "I'll try that."</p><p>谢顿望着皇帝说：“我会试试看。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>22</p><p>22</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mr. Bindris," said Hari Seldon, reaching out his hand to shake the other's. "I am so glad to be able to see you. It was good of you to agree to see me."</p><p>“宾缀斯先生，”哈里·谢顿一面说，一面伸出手与对方握了握，“我真高兴能见到您。您同意见我，令我感激不尽。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?" said Terep Bindris jovially. "I know you well. Or, rather, I know of you well."</p><p>“何必见外呢？”泰瑞普·宾缀斯高兴地说，“我对您很熟悉，或者应该说，我久仰大名。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's pleasant. I take it you've heard of psychohistory, then."</p><p>“十分荣幸。那么，我猜您听说过心理史学。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh yes, what intelligent person hasn't? Not that I understand anything about it, of course. And who is this young lady you have with you?"</p><p>“喔，是啊，哪个聪明人没听说过呢？不过，我对它的内容当然一窍不通。跟您来的这位小姐是什么人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My granddaughter, Wanda."</p><p>“是我的孙女，婉达。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A very pretty young woman." He beamed. "Somehow I feel I'd be putty in her hands."</p><p>“一位非常漂亮的少女。”他露出微笑，“不知道怎么回事，我觉得我会任她捏弄。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said, "I think you exaggerate, sir."</p><p>婉达说：“我想您太夸张了，阁下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, really. Now, please, sit down and tell me what it is I can do for you." He gestured expansively with his arm, indicating that they be seated on two overstuffed, richly brocaded chairs in front of the desk at which he sat. The chairs, like the ornate desk, the imposing carved doors which had slid back noiselessly at their arrival signal, and the gleaming obsidian floor of Bindris's vast office, were of the finest quality. And, although his surroundings were impressive-and imposing-Bindris himself was not. The slight cordial man would not be taken, at first glance, for one of Trantor's leading financial powerbrokers.</p><p>“不，真的。好啦，快请坐，告诉我有什么是我能效劳的。”他坐回办公桌后面，并做了一个大方的手势，示意他们坐在两把又软又厚且覆着精美锦缎的椅子上。就像那张华丽的办公桌、那组堂皇的雕门（收到访客光临的讯号后，它们便无声地滑开），以及偌大办公室中亮晶晶的黑曜石地板，办公桌正前方的那两把椅子也是最精致的上品。不过，虽然四周都是华丽堂皇的陈设，宾缀斯本身却不然。乍看之下，谁也不会以为这个瘦小而热诚的人，就是川陀数一数二的金融权力掮客。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We're here, sir, at the Emperor's suggestion."</p><p>“我们到这儿来，阁下，是遵照皇帝陛下的建议。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Emperor?"</p><p>“皇帝？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, he could not help us, but he thought a man like you might be able to do so. The question, of course, is credits."</p><p>“是的，他无法帮助我们，但他想到像您这样的人或许有办法。问题当然是信用点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bindris's face fell. "Credits?" he said. "I don't understand."</p><p>宾缀斯立刻拉下脸。“信用点？”他说，“我不懂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well," said Seldon, "for nearly forty years, psychohistory has been supported by the government. However, times change and the Empire is no longer what it was."</p><p>“这个嘛，”谢顿说，“将近四十年来，心理史学一向由政府资助。然而，时代不同了，帝国已不再是昔日的帝国。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I know that."'</p><p>“是的，这我知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Emperor lacks the credits to support us or, even if he did have the credits, he couldn't get the request for funding past the Legislature. He recommends, therefore, that I see businesspeople who, in the first place, still have credits and, in the second place, can simply write out a credit voucher."</p><p>“皇帝陛下欠缺资助我们的信用点，而纵使有足够的信用点，他也无法让立法院通过这笔预算。因此，他推荐我来见几位实业家，一来他们还有信用点，二来他们随手就能签一张信用点券。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was a longish pause and Bindris finally said, "The Emperor, I'm afraid, knows nothing about business. -How many credits do you want?"</p><p>经过略长的停顿后，宾缀斯终于说：“只怕皇帝对商场的情况一无所知。你要多少信用点？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mr. Bindris, we're talking about an enormous task. I'm going to need several million."</p><p>“宾缀斯先生，我们是在讨论一项庞大的计划，我需要好几百万。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Several million!"</p><p>“好几百万！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>“是的，阁下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bindris frowned. "Are we talking about a loan here? When do you expect to be able to pay it back?"</p><p>宾缀斯皱起眉头。“我们是在讨论一项贷款吗？你指望何时能够偿还？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, Mr. Bindris, I can't honestly say I ever expect to be able to pay it back. I'm looking for a gift."</p><p>“这个嘛，宾缀斯先生，老实说，我从未指望能够偿还，我是希望获得一笔馈赠。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Even if I wanted to give you the credits-and let me tell you, for some strange reason I very much want to do so-I couldn't. The Emperor may have his Legislature, but I have my Board members. I can't make a gift of that sort without the Board's permission and they'll never grant it."</p><p>“即使我想给你这笔信用点，我也爱莫能助。告诉你一件事，由于某种奇怪的理由，我还非常想这么做。皇帝有他的立法院，我则需要面对我的董事会成员。没有董事会的批准，我就不能做那样的馈赠，而他们是绝不会答应的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? Your firm is enormously wealthy. A few million would mean nothing to you."</p><p>“为何不会？贵公司极为富有，几百万对你们来说不算什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That sounds good," said Bindris, "but I'm afraid that the firm is in a state of decline right now. Not sufficiently to bring us into serious trouble, but enough to make us unhappy. If the Empire is in a state of decay, different individual parts of it are decaying, too. We are in no position to Land out a few million. -I'm truly sorry."</p><p>“这话很受用，”宾缀斯说，“可是只怕此时此刻，本公司正处于走下坡的阶段。虽不至于为我们带来严重困扰，却也足以使我们不快乐。如果说帝国处于衰败状态，那么其中各个部分同样都在衰败。我们现在没有能力捐出几百万，我实在很抱歉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sat there silently and Bindris seemed unhappy. He shook his Head at last and said, "Look, Professor Seldon, I would really like to help you out, particularly for the sake of the young lady you have with you. It just can't be done. -However, we're not the only firm in Trantor. Try others, Professor. You may have better luck elsewhere."</p><p>谢顿默默坐在那里。宾缀斯似乎闷闷不乐，最后他摇了摇头，说道：“听着，谢顿教授，我真的很想帮助你，尤其是看在你身边这位小姐份上，问题是我根本无能为力。然而，我们并不是川陀上唯一的公司。试试别家看，教授，你在别处也许会有较好的运气。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well," said Seldon, raising himself to his feet with an effort, "we shall try."</p><p>“好吧，”谢顿一面说，一面吃力地站起来，“我们会试试看。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>23</p><p>23</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda's eyes were filled with tears, but the emotion they represented was not sorrow but fury.</p><p>婉达眼中充满泪水，但那些泪水代表的并非悲伤，而是激愤。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandpa," she said, "I don't understand it. I simply don't understand it. We've been to four different firms. Each one was ruder and nastier to us than the one before. The fourth one just kicked us out. And since then, no one will let us in."</p><p>“爷爷，”她说，“我不懂，我就是不懂。我们拜访了四家公司，一家比一家更无礼，更凶恶，最后一家干脆把我们踢出来。从此以后，就再也没有人让我们进门了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's no mystery, Wanda," said Seldon gently. "When we saw Bindris, he didn't know what we were there for and he was perfectly friendly until I asked for a gift of a few million credits. Then he was a great deal less friendly. I imagine the word went out as to what we wanted and each additional time there was less friendliness until now, when people won't receive us at all. Why should they? They're not going to give us the credits we need, so why waste time with us?"</p><p>“这并不奇怪，婉达。”谢顿柔声道，“我们见宾缀斯的时候，他还不知道我们是为了什么。他原本十分友善，等到我要求几百万信用点的馈赠，他随即变得不友善得多。我猜我们的目的已经四下流传，才让我们受到的待遇越来越不友善，到了现在，他们根本不接见我们了。他们何必那么做呢？他们不准备给我们所需的信用点，又何必和我们浪费时间呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda's anger turned on herself. "And what did I do? I just sat there. Nothing."</p><p>婉达的愤怒转向自己。“而我做了什么？我只是坐在那里，什么也没做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I wouldn't say that," said Seldon. "Bindris was affected by you. It seems to me that he really wanted to give me the credits, largely because of you. You were pushing him and accomplishing something."</p><p>“我可不会那么说，”谢顿道，“宾缀斯的确受到了你的影响。我觉得他真想要给我那些信用点，而这主要是你的缘故。当时你一直在推他，达到了某种效果。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not nearly enough. Besides, all he cared about was that I was pretty."</p><p>“根本不够。而且，他在乎的只是我长得漂亮。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not pretty," muttered Seldon. "Beautiful. Very beautiful."</p><p>“不是漂亮。”谢顿喃喃道，“是美丽，非常美丽。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So what do we do now, Grandpa?" asked Wanda. "After all these years, psychohistory will collapse."</p><p>“现在我们怎么办呢，爷爷？”婉达问道，“花了这么多年的心血，心理史学却要垮了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I suppose that," said Seldon "in a way, it's something that can't be helped. I've been predicting the breakdown of the Empire for nearly forty years and now that it's come, psychohistory breaks down with it."</p><p>“在我想来，”谢顿说，“就某方面而言，这是无可避免的事。近四十年来，我一直在预测帝国的崩溃，现在既然预言成真，心理史学自然跟着一块崩溃。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But psychohistory will save the Empire, at least partly."</p><p>“但是心理史学会拯救帝国，至少会拯救一部分。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know it will, but I can't force it to."</p><p>“我知道它会，但我无法强求。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you just going to let it collapse?"</p><p>“你准备就这么让它垮掉？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "I'll try to keep it from doing so, but I must admit that I don't know how I'm going to do it."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“我会试图避免，但我必须承认，我不知道该怎么做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda said, "I'm going to practice. There must be some way I can strengthen my push, make it easier for me to force people to do what I want them to do."</p><p>婉达说：“我要好好锻炼。一定有什么方法，能使我的推力增强，让我更容易驱使他人做出我要他们做的事情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I wish you could manage."</p><p>“我希望你能设法做到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What are you going to do, Grandpa?"</p><p>“你又准备做什么呢，爷爷？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, nothing much. Two days ago, when I was on my way to see the Chief Librarian, I encountered three men in the Library who were arguing about psychohistory. For some reason, one of them impressed me very much. I urged him to come see me and he agreed. The appointment is for this afternoon at my office."</p><p>“我嘛，没什么。两天前，我在去见图书馆长的半途中，在馆里遇见三个年轻人，他们正在争论心理史学的问题。基于某种原因，其中一人令我印象非常深刻。我力劝他来找我，而他同意了。我们约在今天下午，在我的研究室见面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you going to have him work for you?"</p><p>“你准备要他为你工作？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I would like to-if I have enough credits to pay him with. But it can't hurt to talk with him. After all, what can I lose?"</p><p>“我当然希望——如果我有足够的信用点支付他。但和他谈谈总没有害处，毕竟，我有什么好输的呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>24</p><p>24</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The young man arrived at precisely 4 T.S.T. (Trantorian Standard Time) and Seldon smiled. He loved punctual people. He placed his hands on his desk and made ready to heave to his feet, but the young man said, "Please, Professor, I know you have a bad leg. You needn't stand up."</p><p>川陀标准时间下午四点整，那年轻人走了进来。谢顿微微一笑，他喜爱准时的人。他将双手按在书桌上，准备起身迎接，但那年轻人说：“请别客气，教授，我知道您有一条腿不方便，您不必站起来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Thank you, young man. However, that does not mean that you cannot sit down. Please do."</p><p>谢顿说：“谢谢你，年轻人。然而，这并不表示你不能坐下，请坐吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The young man removed his jacket and sat down.</p><p>年轻人脱下外套，坐了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "You must forgive me……when we met and set up this appointment, I neglected to learn your name-which is……?</p><p>谢顿说：“你一定得原谅我……当我们不期而遇，订下这个约会的时候，我竟然忘了问你的名字，你叫……？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Stettin Palver," said the young man.</p><p>“史铁亭·帕佛。”年轻人答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah. Palver! The name sounds familiar."</p><p>“啊，帕佛！帕佛！这个姓氏听来挺熟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It should, Professor. My grandfather boasted frequently of having known you."</p><p>“应该的，教授，我祖父常常自夸说认识您。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Your grandfather. Of course. Joramis Palver. He was two years younger than I was, as I recall. I tried to get him to join me in psychohistory, but he refused. He said there was no chance of his ever learning enough mathematics to make it possible. Too bad! How is Joramis, by the way?"</p><p>“你祖父当然就是久瑞米斯·帕佛。我还记得，他比我年轻两岁。我试图让他加入我的心理史学计划，但是他拒绝了。他说，他不可能学会足够的数学来实现这件事。太可惜了！对了，久瑞米斯好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Palver said solemnly, "I'm afraid that Joramis has gone the way of old men generally. He's dead."</p><p>史铁亭·帕佛神情严肃地说：“只怕久瑞米斯去了老年人总要去的地方，他过世了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon winced. Two years younger than he himself was-and dead. An old friend and they had lost touch to such a degree that, when death came, it did so unknowingly.</p><p>谢顿心头一凛。比他自己还年轻两岁，却过世了。多年的老友竟然失联到这种程度，以致对方去世时，他根本一无所知。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sat there for a while and finally muttered, "I'm sorry."</p><p>谢顿呆坐了一会儿，最后终于喃喃道：“十分遗憾。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The young man shrugged. "He had a good life."</p><p>年轻人耸了耸肩。“他一生过得很好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you, young man, where did you have your schooling?"</p><p>“而你呢，年轻人，你在哪里受的教育？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Langano University."</p><p>“朗冈诺大学。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon frowned. "Langano? Stop me if I'm wrong, but that's not on Trantor, is it?"</p><p>谢顿皱起眉头。“朗冈诺？我若说错了立刻纠正我，但它不在川陀上，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. I wanted to try a different world. The Universities on Trantor, as you undoubtedly know very well, are all overcrowded. I wanted to find a place where I could study in peace."</p><p>“是的，我当初是想尝试另一个世界。川陀上每一所大学，您无疑非常清楚，全都过分拥挤，我想找个能让我安静读书的地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what did you study?"</p><p>“你读的是什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing much. History. Not the sort of thing that would lead one to a good job."</p><p>“没什么不得了的。我主修历史，不是那种找得到好工作的学问。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Another wince, even worse than the first. Dors Venabili had been a historian.)</p><p>又是一凛，这次甚至更严重——铎丝·凡纳比里就是历史学家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "But you're back here on Trantor. Why is that?"</p><p>谢顿说：“但你又回到了川陀，为什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Credits. Jobs."</p><p>“为了工作，为了信用点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As an historian?"</p><p>“当个历史学家？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Palver laughed. "Not a chance. I run a device that pulls and hauls. Not exactly a professional occupation."</p><p>帕佛哈哈大笑。“门都没有。我负责操作一个拖拉和牵引的装置，不算正式的职业。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked at Palver with a twinge of envy. The contours of Palver's arms and chest were highlighted by the thin fabric of his shirt. He was well muscled. Seldon had never himself been quite that muscular.</p><p>谢顿带着嫉妒的眼神望着帕佛。帕佛穿着一件单薄的衬衫，凸显出双臂与胸膛的轮廓。他的肌肉结实，谢顿自己从来没有那么结实的肌肉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I presume that when you were at the University, you were on the boxing team."</p><p>谢顿说：“我推测你在大学的时候，曾是拳击队的一员。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Who, me? Never. I'm a Twister."</p><p>“谁，我？从来没有，我是个角力士。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A Twister!" Seldon's spirits jumped. "Are you from Helicon?"</p><p>“角力士！”谢顿精神一振，“你是从赫利肯来的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Palver said with a certain contempt, "You don't have to come from Helicon to be a good Twister."</p><p>帕佛带着些不屑说：“优秀的角力士不一定都来自赫利肯。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No, thought Seldon, but that's where the best ones come from.</p><p>没错，谢顿心想，可是一流高手都是出自那里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>However, he said nothing.</p><p>然而，他什么也没说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did say, though, "Well, your grandfather would not join me. How about you?"</p><p>不过，他倒是说了些别的。“好，当初你祖父不愿加入我，那你自己呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Psychohistory?"</p><p>“心理史学？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I heard you talking to the others when I first encountered you and it seemed to me that you were talking quite intelligently about psychohistory. Would you like to join me, then?"</p><p>“我头一次遇见你的时候，听到你和两个人聊天，在我听来，你似乎对心理史学说得头头是道。所以说，你愿意加入我吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As I said, Professor, I have a job."</p><p>“我说过了，教授，我已经有一份工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Pushing and hauling. Come, come."</p><p>“拖拉和牵引，得了吧，得了吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It pays well."</p><p>“待遇很好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Credits aren't everything."</p><p>“信用点并不是一切。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They're quite a bit. Now you, on the other hand, can't pay me much. I'm quite certain that you're short of credits."</p><p>“但相当有用。另一方面，您无法付我多高的薪水，我相当确定您短缺信用点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why do you say that?"</p><p>“你为何这样说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm guessing, in a way, I suppose. -But am I wrong?"</p><p>“我想，可以说是我猜的。但我说错了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon's lips pressed together hard, then he said, "No, you're not wrong and I can't pay you much. I'm sorry. I suppose that ends our little interview."</p><p>谢顿紧紧抿起嘴唇，然后又说：“不，你没说错，我无法付你多高的薪水。很抱歉，我想这代表我们简短的会晤到此为止。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wait, waaaaaaaaa." Palver held up his hands. "Not quite so fast, please. We're still talking about psychohistory. If I work for you, I will be taught psychohistory, right?"</p><p>“慢着，慢着，慢着。”帕佛举起双手，“没这么快，拜托，我们还在谈论心理史学。假如我为您工作，就能学习心理史学，对吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course."</p><p>“当然。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, credits aren't everything, after all. I'll make you a deal. You teach me all the psychohistory you can and you pay me whatever you can and I'll get by somehow. How about it?"</p><p>“这样的话，信用点毕竟不是一切。我和您打个商量，您尽可能把心理史学都教给我，然后量力付我一份薪水，我总有办法活得下去。怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wonderful," said Seldon joyously. "That sounds great. Now, one more thing."</p><p>“好极了。”谢顿欢喜地说，“听起来太好了。此外，还有另一件事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh?"</p><p>“哦？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. I've been attacked twice in recent weeks. The first time my son came to my defense, but he has since gone to Santanni. The second time I made use of my lead-filled walking stick. It worked, but I was dragged before a magistrate and accused of assault and battery……"</p><p>“是的。最近几个星期，我遭到两次攻击。第一次有我儿子赶来保护我，但他现在到圣塔尼去了。第二次我动用我的铅头手杖，它的确管用，但我却被拖到一位治安官面前，被控以蓄意伤害……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why the attacks?" interjected Palver.</p><p>“为什么有人攻击您？”帕佛插嘴问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am not popular. I have been preaching the Fall of the Empire for so long that, now that it is coming, I am blamed for aa."</p><p>“我不受欢迎。多年以来，我劝导世人留心帝国的衰亡，如今预言即将成真，我因此成了众矢之的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I see. Now then, what does all that have to do with the one more thing you mentioned?"</p><p>“我懂了。那么，这些又和您刚才提到的另一件事有什么关系？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I want you to be my bodyguard. You're young, you're strong, and, most of all, you're a Twister. You're exactly what I need."</p><p>“我要你当我的保镖。你既年轻又强壮，而最重要的是，你是个角力士。你正是我需要的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I suppose it can be managed," Palver said with a smile.</p><p>“我想这点好商量。”帕佛带着微笑说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>25</p><p>25</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"See there, Stettin," Seldon said as the two were taking an early evening stroll in one of Trantor's residential sectors near Streeling. The older man pointed to debris-assorted refuse jettisoned from passing groundcars or dropped by careless pedestrians-strewn along the walkway. "In the old days," Seldon continued, "you would never see litter like this. The security officers were vigilant and municipal maintenance crews provided round-the-clock upkeep of all public areas. But, most important, no one would even think of dumping his trash in such a manner. Trantor was our home; we took pride in aa. Now"-Seldon shook his head sadly, resignedly, and sighed……"it's……" He broke off abruptly.</p><p>“看那里，史铁亭。”谢顿说。现在是黄昏时分，两人正在斯璀璘附近的川陀住宅区闲逛。这位长辈指着人行道旁堆满的废弃物——五花八门，都是地面车以及没公德心的行人丢弃的。“过去那些年头，”谢顿继续说，“你绝对看不到像这样的垃圾。保安官随时警戒，都市养护人员为一切公共场所提供全天候服务。不过，最重要的是，根本没有人会想到用这种方式倾倒垃圾。川陀是我们的家园，我们以它为傲。如今，”谢顿悲伤地、无奈地摇了摇头，又叹了一口气，“它成了……”他突然打住。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You there, young man!" Seldon shouted at a ill-kempt fellow who had moments before passed them, going in the opposite direction. He was munching a treat just popped into his mouth; the wrapper had been tossed to the ground without so much as a downward glance. "Pick that up and dispose of it properly," Seldon admonished as the young man eyed him sullenly.</p><p>“喂，你这年轻人！”谢顿对一个脏兮兮的少年吼道。那少年刚刚和他们擦身而过，走到了他们的后面，他大口嚼着一团刚丢进嘴里的美食，却看也没看就将包装纸扔到地上。“把它捡起来，丢到该丢的地方。”少年绷着脸望过来时，谢顿如此训诫他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Pick it up yourself," the boy snarled and then he turned and walked away.</p><p>“你自己捡起来。”男孩咆哮道，然后转身离去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's another sign of society's breakdown, as predicted by your psychohistory, Professor Seldon," Palver said.</p><p>“这是社会崩溃的另一个征兆，正如你的心理史学所预测的，谢顿教授。”帕佛说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Stettin. All around us the Empire is falling apart, piece by piece. In fact, it's already smashed-there's no turning back now. Apathy, decay, and greed have all played their parts in destroying the once-glorious Empire. And what will take its place? Why……"</p><p>“是啊，史铁亭。环顾我们四周，帝国到处都在一点一滴瓦解。事实上，它早已粉碎，如今已经没有回头的机会。冷漠、腐化和贪婪，都作出一己的贡献来摧毁这个盛极一时的帝国。取而代之的会是什么呢？为什么……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Here Seldon broke off at the sight of Palver's face. The younger man seemed to be listening intently-but not to Seldon's voice. His head was cocked to one side and his face had a far-off look. It was as if Palver were straining to hear some sound inaudible to everyone but himself.</p><p>说到这里谢顿忽然住口，只顾瞪着帕佛的脸。这位晚辈似乎正在凝神倾听，却不是在听谢顿的声音。他的头偏向一侧，脸上露出飘忽的表情。仿佛帕佛正在尽最大的努力，试图聆听只有他一个人听得到的声音。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly he snapped back to the here and now. With an urgent glance around them, Palver took hold of Seldon's arm. "Hari, quick, we must get away. They're coming……" And then the still evening was broken by the harsh sound of rapidly approaching footsteps. Seldon and Palver spun around, but it was too late; a band of attackers was upon them. This time, however, Hari Seldon was prepared. He immediately swung his cane in a wide arc around Palver and himself. At this, the three attackers-two boys and a girl, all teenage ruffians-laughed.</p><p>他突然间回过神来，惶急地四下张望一番，便一把抓住谢顿的手臂。“哈里，快，我们必须离开，他们就要来了……”这时，迅速接近的尖锐脚步声打破了黄昏的宁静。谢顿与帕佛绕来绕去，但是太迟了，一帮匪徒已经来到他们面前。然而，这回哈里·谢顿已有准备，他立刻挥动手杖，在帕佛与自己周围划出一大条弧线。看到这种情形，那三名匪徒（两个男孩与一个女孩，都是十几岁的小无赖）不禁哈哈大笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So, you're not goin' to make it easy, are you, old man?" snorted the boy who appeared to be the group's ringleader. "Why, me and my buddies, we'll take you out in two seconds flat. We'll……" All of a sudden, the ringleader was down, the victim of a perfectly placed Twist-kick to his abdomen. The two ruffians who were still standing quickly dropped to a crouch in preparation for attack. But Palver was quicker. They, too, were felled almost before they knew what hit them.</p><p>“所以说，你不准备让我们轻易得手，对不对，老头？”那个看起来像是头目的男孩嗤之以鼻，“哈，我和我的哥儿们，只要两秒钟就能把你摆平。我们要……”转瞬之间，那名头目倒地不起，腹部正中了一记角力踢腿。两个还站着的小无赖立刻身形一矮，摆出准备攻击的姿势。但帕佛的动作比他们更快，于是，两人几乎还不知道怎么回事，便也双双趴到地上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then it was over-almost as soon as it started. Seldon stood off to the side, leaning heavily on his cane, shaking at the thought of his narrow escape. Palver, panting slightly from exertion, surveyed the scene. The three attackers were out cold on the deserted walkway under the darkening dome.</p><p>然后一切就结束了，几乎像出现时一样快。谢顿避到一旁，笨拙地倚在手杖上，想到刚才的千钧一发便忍不住发抖。帕佛则一面微微喘息，一面四下眺望。在夜色渐深的穹顶之下，那三名匪徒昏倒在无人的人行道上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come on, let's get out of here quickly!" Palver urged again, only this time it was not the attackers they would be fleeing.</p><p>“走吧，我们赶紧离开这里！”帕佛再度催促，只不过这一次，他们要躲的并不是什么匪徒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Stettin, we can't leave," protested Seldon. He gestured toward the unconscious would-be muggers. "They're really nothing more than children. They may be dying. How can we just walk away? It's inhumane-thatís what it is-and humanity is exactly what I've been working all these years to protect " Seldon struck the ground with his cane for emphasis and his eyes gleamed with conviction.</p><p>“史铁亭，我们不能离开。”谢顿抗议道，同时指了指三名不省人事的箍颈党，“他们其实只不过是孩子，他们也许奄奄一息，我们怎能这样一走了之？这样做没人性，不折不扣没人性，而我多年来努力保护的对象正是人类。”谢顿用手杖猛击地面来加强语气，双眼还射出坚定的目光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nonsense," retorted Palver. "What's inhumane is the way muggers like that prey on innocent citizens like you. Do you think they'd have given you a second thought? They'd just as soon stick a knife in your gut to steal your last credit-and then kick you as they ran! They'll come to soon enough and slink away to lick their wounds. Or someone will find them and call the central office.</p><p>“胡说。”帕佛反驳道，“真正不人道的，是箍颈党劫掠你这种无辜市民的方式。你以为他们会顾虑你吗？他们只会在你的肚子上插一刀，以便偷掉你的最后一个信用点，跑开时还不忘再踢你一脚！他们很快就会苏醒，然后逃到别处去舔他们的伤口。或者有人会发现他们，而向中央办公室报案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But, Hari, you must think. After what happened last time, you stand to lose everything if you're linked to another beating. Please, Hari, we must run!" With this, Palver grabbed Seldon's arm and Seldon after a List backward glance, allowed himself to be led away.</p><p>“可是，哈里，你必须为自己着想。发生上次那件事情后，你若是再扯上另一件斗殴，就有失去一切的危险。拜托，哈里，我们非跑不可！”说到这里，帕佛抓住谢顿的手臂，谢顿则在回望了最后一眼之后，便任由帕佛拉着自己离去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As the footsteps of the rapidly departing Seldon and Palver diminished in the distance, another figure emerged from his hiding place behind some trees. Chuckling to himself, the sullen-eyed youth muttered: "You're a fine one to tell me what's right and what's wrong, Professor " With that, he spun on his heel and headed off to summon the security officers.</p><p>当谢顿与帕佛迅疾的脚步声渐行渐远之际，一个躲在几棵树后面的身形冒了出来。这个双眼冒火的少年一面对自己呵呵笑，一面喃喃道：“你真教会了我什么是对错和是非，教授。”说完，他随即拔腿飞奔，前去召唤保安官。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>26</p><p>26</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Order! I will have order!" bellowed Judge Tejan Popjens Lih. The public hearing of Professor Raven Seldon and his young associate, Stettin Palver, had generated a hue and cry among the populace of Trantor. Here was the man who had predicted the Fall of the Empire, the decay of civilization, who exhorted others to harken back to the golden age of civility and order-here was he who, according to an eyewitness, had ordered the brutal beating of three young Trantorians for no apparent provocation. Ah yes, it promised to be a spectacular hearing, one which would lead, no doubt, to an even more spectacular trial.</p><p>“秩序！我需要秩序！”帖贞·帕普坚·李赫法官怒吼道。今天这场为乌鸦嘴谢顿教授，以及他的年轻助理史铁亭·帕佛所举办的公开听证会，在川陀民众间引起极大的轰动。这个人曾经预言帝国的衰亡与文明的没落；他也曾劝勉他人，应当回顾由谦恭与秩序所构成的黄金时代。如今，根据某位目击者的说法，在没有明显挑衅的情况下，他却下令痛殴三个年轻的川陀人。啊，这必定是一场精彩的听证会，而且毫无疑问，将导致一场甚至更精彩的审判。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The judge pressed a contact set into a recessed panel on her bench and a sonorous gong resounded through the packed courtroom. "I will have order," she repeated to the now-hushed throng. "If need be, the courtroom will be cleared. That is a warning. It will not be repeated."</p><p>女法官按下席位上某个凹板内的开关，响亮的锣声随即响彻拥挤的法庭。“我需要秩序，”她对安静下来的群众重复了一遍，“假如有必要，法庭会清场。这是唯一的警告，不会重复第二遍。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The judge cut an imposing figure in her scarlet robe. Originally from the Outer World of Lystena, Lih's complexion had a slight bluish cast, which turned darker when she became exercised, practically purple when she was really angry. It was rumored that, for all her years on the bench, in spite of her reputation as a top judicial mind, notwithstanding her position as one of the most revered interpreters of Imperial law, Lih was ever so slightly vain about the colorful appearance she gave, the way in which the bright red robes set off her soft turquoise skin.</p><p>身穿深红色长袍的法官显得仪表堂堂。李赫法官来自外围世界利斯坦纳，她的肌肤带点青蓝的色调，当她烦恼时肤色便会加深，当她真正发怒时，则会变得接近紫色。据说，担任法官多年的她，虽然拥有最佳司法头脑的名声，尽管身为最受尊崇的帝国法律诠释者之一，然而对于自己多彩的外表——艳丽红袍衬托出稍带青绿色的皮肤——李赫总有那么一点自负。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nevertheless, Lih had a reputation for coming down hard on those who brooked Imperial law; she was one of the few judges left who upheld the civil code without wavering.</p><p>纵然如此，对于违反帝国法律的人，李赫的严厉则是出了名的。坚定不移地拥护民法的法官已所剩无几，而李赫便是其中之一。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have heard of you, Professor Seldon, and your theories about our imminent destruction. And I have spoken with the magistrate who recently heard another case in which you were involved, one in which you struck a man with your lead-filled cane. In that instance, too, you claimed to be the victim of assault. Your reasoning stemmed, I believe, from a previous unreported incident in which you and your son allegedly were assaulted by eight hoodlums. You were able to convince my esteemed colleague, Professor Seldon of your plea of self-defense, even though an eyewitness testified otherwise. This time, Professor, you will have to be much more convincing."</p><p>“我久仰大名，谢顿教授，亦曾耳闻你提出的毁灭即将来临的学说。关于你最近的另一件案子，就是你被控用铅头手杖击打他人的那件，我也和审理该案的治安官谈过。在那个案件中，你同样自称是被害人。我相信，你的推论源自先前一桩未曾报案的事件，据称那次你和你儿子遭到八个小流氓袭击。你有办法让那位我所敬重的同仁相信你是自卫，谢顿教授，虽然有一位目击者作出相反的证词。而这一次，教授，你的辩解必须加倍有说服力才行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The three hoodlums who were bringing charges against Seldon and Palver snickered in their seats at the plaintiff's table. They presented a much different appearance today than they had the evening of the attack. The young men were sporting clean loose-fitting unisuits; the young lady was wearing a crisply pleated tunic. All in all, if one didn't look (or listen) too closely, the three presented a reassuring picture of Trantorian youth.</p><p>对谢顿与帕佛提出控诉的三个小流氓，这时正坐在原告席上窃笑。与当天傍晚比较起来，今天他们的装扮很不一样。两个少年穿着清洁而宽松的连身服，那名少女则身着带有波浪皱褶的上衣。总而言之，倘若不仔细（用眼睛或耳朵）观察他们，谁都会以为他们代表了充满希望的川陀新生代。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon's lawyer, Civ Novker (who was representing Palver as well), approached the bench. "Your Honor, my client is an upstanding member of the Trantorian community. He is a former First Minister of stellar repute. He is a personal acquaintance of our Emperor Agis XIV. What possible benefit could Professor Seldon derive from attacking innocent young people? He is one of the most vocal proponents of stimulating the intellectual creativity of Trantorian youth-his Psychohistory Project employs numerous student volunteers; he is a beloved member of the Streeling University faculty.</p><p>这时，谢顿的律师西夫·诺夫可（他同时也代表帕佛）走向发言台。“庭上，我的当事人乃是川陀社会正直诚实的一员，他是拥有星际声誉的前首相，和皇帝陛下艾吉思十四世也有私交。若说谢顿教授攻击几位无辜的年轻人，他可能得到什么利益呢？他一向最积极提倡刺激川陀青年的创造力，他的心理史学计划雇用了众多学生志愿者，他还是斯璀璘大学中受人敬爱的一位教授。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Further……" Here Novker paused, sweeping his gaze around the packed courtroom, as if to say, Wait till you hear this-you'll be ashamed that you ever for a second doubted the veracity of my client's claims, "Professor Seldon is one of the very few private individuals officially allied with the prestigious Galactic Library. He has been granted unlimited use of Library facilities for work on what he calls the Encyclopedia Galactica, a veritable paean to Imperial civilization.</p><p>“此外——”诺夫可在此顿了一顿，目光扫过这间挤满人的法庭，仿佛在说：你们等着吧，听到这句话，你们便会羞愧得无地自容，因为你们竟然怀疑我的当事人的陈述不实。“谢顿教授和举世闻名的帝国图书馆有正式合作关系，拥有这项殊荣的个人少之又少。他获准无限制地使用该馆的设备，以便筹备他所谓的《银河百科全书》，那是名符其实的帝国文明赞歌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I ask you, how can this man even be questioned in such a matter?"</p><p>“我请问诸位，这样一个人，我们怎能对他进行这种质问？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With a flourish of his arm, Novker gestured toward Seldon who was sitting at the defendant's table with Stettin Palver, looking decidedly uncomfortable. Hari's cheeks were flushed from the unaccustomed praise (after all, lately his name was the subject of derisive snickers rather than flowery plaudits) and his hand shook slightly on the carved Dandle of his trusty cane.</p><p>诺夫可夸张地挥手向谢顿指去，后者与史铁亭·帕佛坐在被告席上，看起来十分不自在。听到这些很不习惯的赞美，谢顿涨红了双颊（毕竟最近几年，他的名字总是冷嘲热讽的对象，从未与词藻华丽的颂赞连在一起），他的右手按在那根忠实手杖的雕花手把处，此时还在微微颤抖。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Judge Lih gazed down at Seldon clearly unimpressed. "What benefit, indeed, Counselor. I have been asking myself that very question. I've lain make these past nights, racking my brains for a plausible reason. Why should a man of Professor Seldon's stature commit unprovoked assault and battery when he himself is one of our most outspoken critics of the so-called `breakdown' of civil order?</p><p>李赫法官无动于衷地低头凝视谢顿。“的确，究竟有何利益，律师。我一直拿同样的问题问我自己，过去几天我彻夜难眠，绞尽脑汁在想一个说得通的理由。像谢顿教授这样拥有卓着声誉，自己又是不遗余力批评‘社会秩序崩溃’的人之一，他为什么无缘无故犯下蓄意伤害罪？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And then it dawned on me. Perhaps, in his frustration at not being believed, Professor Seldon feels he must prove to the worlds that his predictions of doom and gloom really are coming to pass. After all, here is a man who has spent his entire career foretelling the Fall of the Empire and all he can really point to are a few burned-out bulbs in the dome, an occasional glitch in public transport, a budget cut here or there -nothing very dramatic. But an attack-or two or three-now, that would be something."</p><p>“后来我渐渐想通了。说不定是这样的，由于没有人相信他的话，谢顿教授在饱受挫折之余，觉得他必须对所有的世界证明，他所预测的劫数与噩运确实即将来临。毕竟，此人毕生的志业就是预言帝国的衰亡，而他真正能指出的，却只有穹顶上几个烧坏的灯泡、公共运输偶尔的故障、某些部门的预算删减——都没有什么大不了的。可是一次攻击，甚或两三次，啊，那就另当别论了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Lih sat back and folded her hands in front of her, a satisfied expression on her face. Seldon stood, leaning heavily on the table for support. With great effort, he approached the bench, waving off his lawyer, walking headlong into the steely gaze of the judge.</p><p>李赫靠回椅背，双手合在身前，脸上露出一副满足的表情。谢顿借着桌子的支撑，慢慢站了起来。他极其吃力地走向发言台，挥手要他的律师走开，然后循着法官无情的目光一路走去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Your Honor, please permit me to say a few words in my defense."</p><p>“庭上，请允许我说几句话为自己辩护。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course, Professor Seldon. After all, this is not a trial, only a hearing to air all allegations, facts, and theories pertinent to ~ a case before deciding whether or not to go ahead with a trial. I have merely expressed a theory; I am most interested to hear what you have to say."</p><p>“当然可以，谢顿教授。这毕竟不是审判，只是一场听证会，目的就是要公开和本案有关的一切申述、事实以及说法，然后方能决定是否要进一步举行审判。我只不过提出了一种推测，我最想听的就是你自己怎么说。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon cleared his throat before beginning. "I have devoted my life to the Empire. I have faithfully served the Emperors. My science of psychohistory, rather than being a harbinger of destruction, is intended to be used as an agent for rejuvenation. With it we can be prepared for whatever course civilization takes. If, as I believe, the Empire continues to break down, psychohistory will help us put into place building blocks for a new and better civilization founded on all that is good from the old. I love our worlds, our peoples, our Empire-what would it behoove me to contribute to the lawlessness that saps its strength daily?</p><p>谢顿清了清喉咙，开口道：“我将一生奉献给帝国，我忠实侍奉每一位皇帝。我的心理史学这门科学，其实并非预报毁灭的信使，而是意图作为一种复兴机制。有了它，不论文明的走向如何，我们皆能有所准备。倘若正如我所相信的，帝国将继续崩溃，心理史学便会帮助我们保存未来文明的基石，让我们能在优良的固有基础上，重建一个更新更好的文明。我爱我们所有的世界、我们的同胞、我们的帝国，我怎么会参与那些日渐削弱国势的不法行为？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can say no more. You must believe me. I, a man of intellect, of equations, of science-I am speaking from my heart." Seldon turned and made his way slowly back to his chair beside Palver. Before sitting, his eyes sought Wanda, sitting in the spectators' gallery. She smiled wanly and winked at him.</p><p>“我不能再说什么了，你必须相信我。我，一个献身智识、方程式和科学的人，我所说的都是我的肺腑之言。”谢顿转过身去，缓缓走回帕佛旁边的座位。在就坐之前，他的目光寻找到婉达，她坐在旁听席上，露出无力的笑容，并对他眨了眨眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"From the heart or not, Professor Seldon, this decision will require much thought on my part. We have heard from your accusers; we have heard from you and Mr. Palver. There is one more party whose testimony I need. I'd like to hear from Rial Nevas, who has come forward as an eyewitness to this incident."</p><p>“不论是不是肺腑之言，谢顿教授，我都需要长久的思考才能作出决定。我们已经听过原告的陈述，我们也听过了你和帕佛先生的陈述，现在我还需要另一方的证词。我希望听听莱耳·纳瓦斯怎么说，在这个事件中，他的身份是目击者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As Nevas approached the bench, Seldon and Palver looked at each other in alarm. It was the boy whom Hari had admonished just before the attack.</p><p>纳瓦斯走向发言台之际，谢顿与帕佛警觉地互望了一眼。他正是那场打斗发生前，谢顿所训诫的那个男孩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Lih was asking the youth a question. "Would you describe, Mr. Nevas, exactly what you witnessed on the night in question?"</p><p>李赫开始问这个少年。“能否请你描述一下，纳瓦斯先生，当天晚上你所目击的确切经过？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well," started Nevas, fixing Seldon with his sullen stare, "I was walkin' along, mindin' my own business, when I saw those two,"-he turned and pointed at Seldon and Palver……"on the other side of the walkway, comin' toward me. And then I saw those three kids." (Another point of the finger, this time toward the three sitting at the plaintiff's table.) "The two older guys were walkin' behind the kids. They didn't see me, though, on account of I was on the other side of the walkway and besides, they were concentratin' on their victims. Then wham! Just like that, that old guy swings at 'em with his stick, then the younger guy jumps 'em and kicks 'em and before you know it, they're all down on the ground. Then the old guy and his pal, they just took off, just like that. I couldn't believe it."</p><p>“这个嘛，”纳瓦斯以愠怒的目光凝视着谢顿，“我正在路上走着，想着我自个儿的心事，忽然看到这两个家伙——”他转过身去，指向谢顿与帕佛。“在人行道另一边，向我这个方向走来。然后，我又看到那三个孩子。”他又伸手指了指，这回是指向坐在原告席的三位。“这两个家伙走在三个孩子后头，不过他们没看到我，原因是我在人行道另一边，而且，他们的注意力都放在被害人身上。然后，轰！就像这样，那老家伙用他的拐杖向他们挥去，然后不太老的那个跳到他们面前，用脚踢他们。在你还没弄清怎么回事的时候，他们已经全部倒在地上。然后老家伙和他的同伴，他们就这么走了，我简直不敢相信。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's a lie!" Seldon exploded. "Young man, you're playing with our lives here!" Nevas only stared back at Seldon impassively.</p><p>“你说谎！”谢顿爆发出来，“年轻人，你是在拿我们的性命开玩笑！”纳瓦斯却只是漠然回瞪着谢顿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Judge," Seldon implored, "can't you see that he is lying? I remember this fellow. I scolded him for littering just minutes before we were attacked. I pointed it out to Stettin as another instance of the breakdown of our society, the apathy of the citizenry, the……"</p><p>“法官，”谢顿恳求道，“您看不出他是在说谎吗？我记得这个人，在我们遭到攻击前没多久，我曾责骂他乱丢垃圾。我还对史铁亭指出这是另一个例证，证明我们的社会崩溃，公德心沦丧，以及……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Enough, Professor Seldon," commanded the judge. "Another outburst like that and I will have you ejected from this courtroom. Now, Mr. Nevas," she said, turning back to the witness. "What did you do throughout the sequence of events you just described?"</p><p>“够了，谢顿教授。”法官命令道，“你再像这样发作一次，我就把你逐出这间法庭。好，纳瓦斯先生，”她转头面向证人，“在你刚才叙述的一连串事件发生之际，你自己在做什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I, uh, I hid. Behind some trees. I hid. I was afraid they'd come after me if they saw me, so I hid. And when they were gone, well, I ran and called the security officers."</p><p>“我，啊，我躲了起来，躲在几棵树后头。我怕要是给他们看到，他们会追我，所以我躲了起来。等到他们走了，嗯，我就跑去找保安官。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nevas had started to sweat and he inserted a finger into the constricting collar of his unisuit. He fidgeted, shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he stood on the raised speaker's platform. He was uncomfortably aware of the crowd's eyes upon him; he tried to avoid looking into the audience, but each time he did, he found himself drawn to the ,,toady gaze of a pretty blond girl sitting in the first row. It was as if she was asking him a question, pressing him for an answer, willing him to ,,peak.</p><p>纳瓦斯已经开始出汗，并将一根手指塞进束紧的单件服领子里。惴惴不安的他站在隆起的发言台上，不停地将重心在两脚之间挪移。他察觉到众人的目光都集中在自己身上，令他感到很不自在；他试着避免望向旁听的群众，但他每次这么做，便发觉自己被坐在第一排一位美丽金发少女沉稳的目光所吸引。仿佛她正在问他一个问题，并动念驱使他开口，逼他说出答案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mr. Nevas, what do you have to say about Professor Seldon's allegation that he and Mr. Palver did see you prior to the attack, that the professor actually exchanged words with you?"</p><p>“纳瓦斯先生，对于谢顿教授的陈述，他和帕佛先生在那场打斗前曾见过你，而且教授和你交谈过，你有什么话要说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, uh, no, you see, it was just like I said……I was walkin' along and-' And now Nevas looked over at Seldon's table. Seldon looked at the young man sadly, as if he realized all was lost. But Seldon's companion, Stettin Palver, turned a fierce gaze on Nevas and Nevas jumped, startled, at the words he heard: Tell the truth! It was as if Palver had spoken, but Palver's lips hadn't moved. And then, confused, Nevas snapped his head in the direction of the blond girl; he thought he heard her speak-Tell the truth!-but her lips were still as well.</p><p>“这个，啊，不对，你知道的，就像我所说的……我正在路上走着，而……”此时纳瓦斯望向谢顿的位置，谢顿则悲伤地望着这个少年，仿佛了解到自己已一败涂地。可是谢顿的同伴——史铁亭·帕佛——却以严厉的目光瞪着纳瓦斯。纳瓦斯突然听到一句：讲实话！令他吓了一跳，吃了一惊。那句话好像是帕佛说的，但帕佛一直未曾张嘴。然后，在一阵错愕中，纳瓦斯猛然将头转向金发少女的方向，觉得自己也听到她在说：讲实话！但她的嘴唇同样一动不动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mr. Nevas, Mr. Nevas," the judge's voice broke in on the youth's jumbled thoughts. "Mr. Nevas, if Professor Seldon and Mr. Palver were walking toward you, behind the three plaintiffs, how is it that you noticed Seldon and Palver first? That is how you put it in your statement, is it not?"</p><p>“纳瓦斯先生，纳瓦斯先生。”法官的声音闯入少年紊乱的思绪，“纳瓦斯先生，假如谢顿教授和帕佛先生从你对面走来，走在三名原告后面，你怎么会先注意到谢顿和帕佛？你在陈述中是这么说的，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nevas glanced around the courtroom wildly. He couldn't seem to escape the eyes, all the eyes screaming at him to Tell the truth! Looking over at Hari Seldon, Rial Nevas said simply, "I'm sorry" and, to the amazement of the entire courtroom assemblage, the fourteen-year-old boy started to cry.</p><p>纳瓦斯狂乱地环视法庭。他似乎无法逃避那些目光，每双眼睛都在对他喊道：讲实话！于是，莱耳·纳瓦斯望着哈里·谢顿，只说了一句：“很抱歉。”然后，出乎法庭内每个人意料之外，这个十四岁的男孩开始哭泣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>27</p><p>27</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a lovely day, neither too warm nor too cold, not too bright nor too gray. Even though the groundskeeping budget had given out years ago, the few straggly perennials lining the steps leading up to the Galactic Library managed to add a cheerful note to the morning. (The Library, having been built in the classical style of antiquity, was fronted with one of the grandest stairways to be found in the entire Empire, second only to the steps at the Imperial Palace itself. Most Library visitors, however, preferred to enter via the gliderail) Seldon had high hopes for the day.</p><p>这是可爱的一天，既不太热也不太冷，既不太亮也不太阴。纵使维护街道的预算几年前便已告罄，帝国图书馆门前台阶旁几棵稀疏的多年生植物，仍为这个早晨增添几许愉悦的气氛。这座图书馆是一栋风格古典的建筑，门前雄伟的阶梯在整个帝国境内数一数二，仅次于皇宫。然而，大多数前往该馆的人，却喜欢经由滑轨进入。对于这一天，谢顿抱着很高的期望。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Since he and Stettin Palver had been cleared of all charges in their recent assault and battery case, Hari Seldon felt like a new man. Although the experience had been painful, its very public nature had advanced Seldon's cause. Judge Tejan Popjens Lih, who was considered one of, if not the most influential judge on Trantor, had been quite vociferous in her opinion, delivered the day following Rial Nevas's emotional testimony.</p><p>自从他与史铁亭·帕佛所卷入的那件蓄意伤害案撤销后，哈里·谢顿觉得一切像是重新来过。虽然这段经历十分痛苦，它的轰动却为谢顿的主张做了最佳宣传。帖贞·帕普坚·李赫即使不是川陀最具影响力的法官，也是公认的其中之一。在莱耳·纳瓦斯作出情绪化证词的次日，她曾以相当夸张的方式发表自己的意见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"When we come to such a crossroads in our `civilized' society," the judge intoned from her bench, "that a man of Professor Hari Seldon's standing is made to bear the humiliation, abuse, and lies of his peers simply because of who he is and what he stands for, it is truly a dark day for the Empire. I admit that I, too, was taken in-at first. `Why wouldn't Professor Seldon,' I reasoned, `resort to such trickery in an attempt to prove his predictions?' But, as I came to see, I was most grievously wrong." Here the judge's brow furrowed, a dark blue flush began creeping up her neck and into her cheeks. "For I was ascribing to Professor Seldon motives born of our new society, a society in which honesty, decency, and goodwill are likely to get one killed, a society in which it appears one must resort to dishonesty and trickery merely to survive.</p><p>“我们来到了‘文明社会’这样的一个十字路口，”这位法官在席位上慷慨激昂地说，“像哈里·谢顿教授这种地位的人，仅仅因为他的身份，以及他所代表的主张，就得忍受自己同胞的羞辱、谩骂和谎言，这真是帝国历史上黑暗的一天。我承认，起初我自己也受到影响。‘为了企图证明他的预测，’我在心中推想，‘谢顿教授大可采用这样的奸计啊？’可是，当我恍然大悟时，我发觉自己错得不可饶恕。”说到这里，法官皱起眉头，她的颈部与双颊开始泛起暗青色。“因为我误将谢顿教授的动机归因于这个新社会，其中，诚实、高尚与善意很可能惹来杀身之祸；一个人仅仅为了生存，似乎就必须诉诸欺诈与奸计。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How far we have strayed from our founding principles. We were lucky this time, fellow citizens of Trantor. We owe a debt of thanks to Professor Hari Seldon for showing us our true selves; let us take his example to heart and resolve to be vigilant against the baser forces of our human nature."</p><p>“我们和我们安身立命的原则已经迷失了多远？这次我们很幸运，川陀的同胞们。我们都应该深深感激哈里·谢顿教授，他让我们看到了我们真正的自我。让我们把他的事例谨记在心，并且痛下决心，时时警戒人性中那些卑劣的力量。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Following the hearing, the Emperor had sent Seldon a congratulatory bolo-disc. On it he expressed the hope that perhaps now Seldon would find renewed funding for his Project.</p><p>那场听证会结束后，皇帝送给谢顿一个表达祝贺的全息光碟。其中，他表达了衷心的希望：谢顿现在也许能为他的计划找到经费了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As Seldon slid up the entrance gliderail, he reflected on the current status of his Psychohistory Project. His good friend-the former Chief Librarian Las Zenow-had retired. During his tenure, Zenow had been a strong proponent of Seldon and his work. More often than not, however, Zenow's hands had been tied by the Library Board. But, he had assured Seldon, the affable new Chief Librarian, Tryma Acarnio, was as progressive as he himself, and was popular with many factions among the Board membership.</p><p>当谢顿沿着入口滑轨缓缓滑升时，他思量着心理史学计划目前的状况。他的好友——前任图书馆长拉斯·齐诺——已经退休。而在他任内，齐诺一向极为支持谢顿与他的工作。然而有大半的时候，齐诺都被图书馆评议会牢牢控制住。可是，他曾经对谢顿保证，那位和蔼可亲的新任馆长垂玛·阿卡尼欧，是个和他自己一样思想进步的人，而且受到评议会中许多派别的欢迎。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari, my friend," Zenow had said before leaving Trantor for his home world of Wencory, "Acarnio is a good man, a person of deep intellect and an open mind. I'm sure he'll do all that he can to help you and the Project. I've left him the entire data file on you and your EncyIopedia; I know he'll be as excited as I about the contribution to humanity it represents. Take care, my friend-I'll remember you fondly."</p><p>“哈里，我的好友，”齐诺在离开川陀、回到他的故乡世界温柯瑞之前曾说，“阿卡尼欧是个好人，具有非凡的才智和开放的心胸。我确定，他会尽他所能来帮助你和你的计划。我将有关你和百科全书的整个资料档案都留给了他；关于对人类可能作出的贡献，我知道他会和我一样兴奋。保重，我的好友，我会时时念着你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And so today Hari Seldon was to have his first official meeting with the new Chief Librarian. He was cheered by the reassurances Las Zenow had left with him and he was looking forward to sharing his plans for the future of the Project and the Encyclopedia.</p><p>因此，今天哈里·谢顿将与新任馆长作首度的正式会晤。拉斯·齐诺留给他的保证令他精神振奋，他期待着与对方分享他对谢顿计划以及百科全书的未来规划。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tryma Acarnio stood as Hari entered the Chief Librarian's office. Already he had made his mark on the place; whereas Zenow had stuffed every nook and cranny of the room with holo-discs and tridijournals from the different sectors of Trantor, and a dizzying array of visiglobes representing various worlds of the Empire had spun in midair, Acarnio had swept clear the mounds of data and images that Zenow had liked to keep at his fingertips. A large holoscreen now dominated one wall on which, Seldon presumed, Acarnio could view any publication or broadcast that he desired.</p><p>谢顿刚走进馆长的办公室，垂玛·阿卡尼欧便站了起来。他已经表现出是这里的主人——齐诺原本在房间各个角落塞满全息光碟，以及来自川陀各区的三维期刊，而代表帝国各个世界、在半空中不停旋转的幻影星球，则排成令人眼花撩乱的阵列。现在，阿卡尼欧已将齐诺堆积如山的资料与影像全清干净。一个大型全息屏幕如今占了一面墙的大半面积，根据谢顿的推测，阿卡尼欧可藉此随意观览任何出版品或广播视讯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Acarnio was short and stocky, with a slightly distracted look-from a childhood corneal correction that had gone awry-that belied a fearsome intelligence and constant awareness of everything going on around him at all times.</p><p>阿卡尼欧身材矮小而结实，带着些许心不在焉的神情，那是幼时角膜矫正手术失败的结果。而这掩藏了他那令人生畏的智慧，以及随时留意周遭一切的警觉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, well. Professor Seldon. Come in. Sit down." Acarnio gestured to a straight-backed chair facing the desk at which he sat. "It was, I felt, quite fortuitous that you requested this meeting. You see, I had intended to get in touch with you as soon as I settled in."</p><p>“稀客，稀客，谢顿教授。请进，请坐。”阿卡尼欧指了指办公桌对面的一张直背座椅，“您要求这次会面，令我感到相当意外。您可知道，我原本打算一旦安顿好，就要立刻和您联络。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded, pleased that the new Chief Librarian had considered him enough of a priority to plan to seek him out in the hectic early days of his tenure.</p><p>谢顿点了点头，感到很高兴。可见这位新馆长足够重视他，在刚刚上任、忙昏了头的日子里，他就打算要找自己了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But, first, Professor, please let me know why you wanted to see me before we move on to my, most likely, more prosaic concerns."</p><p>“可是，首先，教授，请让我知道您为何要见我。然后，我们再来讨论我那个极可能较无趣的问题。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon cleared his throat and leaned forward. "Chief Librarian, Las Zenow has no doubt told you of my work here and of my idea for an Encyclopedia Galactica. Las was quite enthusiastic, and a great help, providing a private office for me here and unlimited access to the Library's vast resources. In fact, it was he who located the eventual home of the Encyclopedia Project, a remote Outer World called Terminus.</p><p>谢顿清了清喉咙，将上身向前倾。“馆长，想必拉斯·齐诺已将我在这里的工作，以及我筹划一套《银河百科全书》的构想告诉您了。拉斯相当热心，而且十分帮忙，他提供我一间个人研究室，以及无限制使用本馆庞大资源的权利。事实上，正是他为百科全书计划找到了最终的归宿，那就是称为端点星的一个遥远外围世界。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There was one thing, however, that Las could not provide. In order to keep the Project on schedule, I must have office space and unlimited access granted to a number of my colleagues, as well. It is an enormous undertaking, just gathering the information to be copied and transferred to Terminus before we can begin the actual work of compiling the Encyclopedia.</p><p>“然而，有一件事却是拉斯无法提供的。为了使这个计划如期执行，我的一批同事也必须在本馆拥有研究室，以及无限制使用设备的权利。在我们展开百科全书的实际编纂工作之前，光是搜集有待复制并转送至端点星的各种资料，本身就是一项庞大的工程。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Las was not popular with the Library Board, as you undoubtedly are aware. You, however, are. And so I ask you, Chief Librarian: Will you see to it that my colleagues are granted insiders' privileges so that we may continue our most vital work?"</p><p>“拉斯在图书馆评议会的人缘不好，这点您必定很清楚。然而，您却人缘极佳。所以我想请问您，馆长，您能否设法让我的同事获得员工的特权，好让我们展开重要无比的工作？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Here Hari stopped, almost out of breath. He was sure that his speech, which he had gone over and over in his mind the night before, would have the desired effect. He waited, confident in Acarnio's response.</p><p>谢顿就此打住，差点喘不过气来。他确信，这番昨晚在心中温习了一遍又一遍的说词，一定能够达到预期效果。现在，他充满信心地等待阿卡尼欧的回应。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Professor Seldon," Acarnio began. Seldon's expectant smile faded. There was an edge to the Chief Librarian's voice that Seldon had not expected. "My esteemed predecessor provided me-in exhaustive detail -an explication of your work here at the Library. He was quite enthusiastic about your research and committed to the idea of your colleagues joining you here. As was I, Professor Seldon"-at Acarnio's pause, Seldon looked up sharply……"at first. I was prepared to call a special meeting of the Board to propose that a larger suite of offices be prepared for you and your Encyclopedists. But, Professor Seldon, all that has now changed."</p><p>“谢顿教授。”阿卡尼欧一开口，谢顿满怀期望的笑容便消失了。这位馆长的声音中，透着谢顿未曾料到的冷峻。“我所敬重的前任馆长曾对我说明——巨细无遗地说明——你在本馆所进行的工作。他对你的研究相当热衷，念念不忘要让你的同事加入你的行列。至于我自己，谢顿教授，”听到阿卡尼欧顿了顿，谢顿猛然抬起头来。“最初，我准备找评议委员开一次特别会议，以便提议为你以及你的百科全书编者提供一些大间的办公室。不过，谢顿教授，现在一切都改变了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Changed! But why?"</p><p>“改变了！可是为什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Professor Seldon, you have just finished serving as principal defendant in a most sensational assault and battery case."</p><p>“谢顿教授，在刚刚落幕的一件轰动无比的蓄意伤害案中，你是主要的被告。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I was acquitted," Seldon broke in. "The case never even made it to trial."</p><p>“但是我无罪开释。”谢顿插嘴道，“这件案子甚至没有正式起诉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nonetheless, Professor, your latest foray into the public eye has given you an undeniable-how shall I say it?-tinge of ill repute. Oh yes, you were acquitted of all charges. But in order to get to that acquittal, your name, your past, your beliefs, and your work were paraded before the eyes of all the worlds. And even if one progressive right-thinking judge has proclaimed you faultless, what of the millions-perhaps billions-of other average citizens who see not a pioneering psychohistorian striving to preserve his civilization's glory but a raving lunatic shouting doom and gloom for the great and mighty Empire?</p><p>“纵然如此，教授，你最近频频出现在大众面前，使你有了一个不容否认的——我该怎么说呢？——一个不太好的名声。喔，是啊，你受到的指控全被撤销。可是为了无罪开释，你的大名、你的过去、你的信仰，以及你的工作，通通摊在世人眼前，让人一览无遗。即使一位思想进步而公正的法官宣称你人格无瑕，可是上百万，甚至上百亿普通公民所看到的，却不是一位为了保存文明的光荣而奋斗的心理史学先锋，而是一个高喊伟大强盛的帝国即将面临劫数和噩运的疯子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You, by the very nature of your work, are threatening the essential fabric of the Empire. I don't mean the huge, nameless, faceless, monolithic Empire. No, I am referring to the heart and soul of the Empire-its people. When you tell them the Empire is failing, you are saying that they are failing. And this, my dear Professor, the average citizen cannot face.</p><p>“你，由于你所从事的这项工作，你正在威胁帝国的根本。我不是指无名无姓、面目模糊、庞大的、整块的帝国。不，我指的是帝国的心脏和灵魂——它的人民。当你告诉他们帝国正在没落，你等于是说他们正在没落。而这一点，我亲爱的教授，一般公民是无法面对的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Seldon, like it or not, you have become an object of derision, a subject of ridicule, a laughingstock."</p><p>“谢顿，不论你喜不喜欢，你都已经成为嘲笑的对象，成为冷嘲热讽的主题，成为众人的笑柄。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Pardon me, Chief Librarian, but for years now I have been, to some circles, a laughingstock."</p><p>“对不起，馆长，但是多年来，在某些圈子里，我一直都是个笑柄。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but only to some circles. But this latest incident-and the very public forum in which it was played out-has opened you up to ridicule not only here on Trantor but throughout the worlds. And, Professor, if, by providing you an office, we, the Galactic Library, give tacit approval to your work, then, by inference, we, the Library, also become a laughingstock throughout the worlds. And no matter how strongly I may personally believe in your theory and your Encyclopedia, as Chief Librarian of the Galactic Library on Trantor, I must think of the Library first.</p><p>“没错，但只是在某些圈子里。可是最近这个事件，以及它在公众间所造成的轰动，令你不只在川陀人尽皆知，而且在各个世界都恶名昭彰。所以，教授，假如，让你拥有一间研究室，我们，帝国图书馆，等于默认你的研究工作，那么，同理，我们，这座图书馆，也会成为众多世界的笑柄。因此，不论我个人多么相信你的理论和你的百科全书，身为帝国图书馆的馆长，我必须先为这座图书馆着想。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And so, Professor Seldon, your request to bring in your colleagues is denied."</p><p>“所以说，谢顿教授，我必须拒绝你带进其他同事的要求。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon jerked back in his chair as if struck.</p><p>哈里·谢顿仿佛被打了一拳，在座椅上猛然向后一仰。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Further," Acarnio continued, "I must advise you of a two-week temporary suspension of all Library privileges-effective immediately. The Board has called that special meeting, Professor Seldon. In two weeks' time we will notify you whether or not we've decided that our association with you must be terminated."</p><p>“此外，”阿卡尼欧继续说，“我必须通知你，你在本馆的一切特权将被暂时吊销两周，立即生效。评议会已准备召开特别会议，谢顿教授。至于是否决定终止和你的合作关系，我们会在两周后告知你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Here, Acarnio stopped speaking and, placing his palms on the glossy, spotless surface of his desk, stood up. "That is all, Professor Seldon-for now."</p><p>说到这里，阿卡尼欧总算住口。他将双掌按在光洁无瑕的办公桌上，借力站了起来。“目前为止，就是这样了，谢顿教授。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon stood as well, although his upward movement was not as smooth, nor as quick, as Tryma Acarnioís..</p><p>哈里·谢顿同样站了起来，不过起身的动作并不像垂玛·阿卡尼欧那么利落，那么迅速。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"May I be permitted to address the Board?" asked Seldon. "Perhaps if I were able to explain to them the vital importance of psychohistory and the Encyclopedia……"</p><p>“我可否获准向评议会陈情？”谢顿问道，“如果我能对他们解释心理史学和百科全书无比的重要性，说不定……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm afraid not, Professor," said Acarnio softly and Seldon caught a brief glimmer of the man Las Zenow had told him about. But, just as quickly, the icy bureaucrat was back as Acarnio guided Seldon to the door.</p><p>“只怕不行，教授。”阿卡尼欧柔声道，这时谢顿才隐约瞥见拉斯·齐诺所说的那个好人。可是来得急去得快，阿卡尼把谢顿送到门口时，又变回了那位冰冷的官僚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As the portals slid open, Acarnio said, "Two weeks, Professor Seldon. Till then." Hari stepped through to his waiting skitter and the doors slid shut.</p><p>当正门滑开时，阿卡尼欧说：“两周后，谢顿教授，到时再见。”谢顿钻进了等在外面的贴地滑车，那组门便重新关上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What am I going to do now? wondered Seldon disconsolately. Is this the end of my work?</p><p>现在我要怎么办？谢顿绝望地自问。我的工作就此结束了吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>28</p><p>28</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda dear, what is it that has you so engrossed?" asked Hari Seldon as he entered his granddaughter's office at Streeling University. The room had been the office of the brilliant mathematician Yugo Amaryl, whose death had impoverished the Psychohistory Project. Fortunately,</p><p>“亲爱的婉达，是什么让你如此全神贯注？”谢顿一面问，一面走进他的孙女位于斯璀璘大学的研究室。这间研究室原本属于杰出的数学家雨果·阿马瑞尔所有，他的去世曾对心理史学计划造成重大打击。幸好近几年来，婉达逐渐接替雨果的角色，开始对元光体作进一步的改良与调整。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda had gradually taken over Yugo's role in recent years, further refining and adjusting the Prime Radiant. "Why, I'm working on an equation in Section 33A2D17. See, I've recalibrated this section"-she gestured to a glowing violet patch suspended in midair in front of her face- `taking into consideration the standard quotient and- There! Just what I thought-I think." She stepped back and rubbed her eyes.</p><p>“啊，我在研究33a2d17节的一条方程式。看，我把这一节重新校准了。”她指了指悬浮在她面前那一片炫目的紫色区域，“把‘标准商’考虑在内……有了！不出我所料，我这么想。”她退后几步，揉了揉眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is it, Wanda?" Hari moved in closer to study the equation. "Why, this looks like the Terminus equation and yet……Wanda, this is an inverse of the Terminus equation, isn't it?"</p><p>“这是什么，婉达？”谢顿凑近以便研究那条方程式，“啊，看来像是端点星方程式，不过……婉达，这是端点星方程式的逆转，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Grandpa. See, the numbers weren't working quite right in the Terminus equation-look." Wanda touched a contact in a recessed wallstrip and another patch sprang to life in vivid red on the other side of the room. Seldon and Wanda walked over to inspect it. "You see how it's all hanging together fine now, Grandpa? It's taken me weeks to get it this way."</p><p>“是的，爷爷。知道吗，端点星方程式中的参数本来不太对劲。看——”婉达碰了碰某个凹陷壁板上的开关，室内另一侧便出现鲜红的一片。谢顿与婉达走过去，开始检视这片区域。“你看现在一切多么契合，爷爷？我花了好几星期才做到的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How did you do it?" asked Hari, admiring the equation's lines, its logic, its elegance.</p><p>“你怎么做到的？”谢顿问道，心中则在赞叹这条方程式的思路、逻辑与优美。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"At first, I concentrated on it from over here only. I blocked out all else. In order to get Terminus to work, work on Terminus--stands to reason, doesn't it? But then I realized that I couldn't just introduce this equation into the Prime Radiant system and expect it to blend right in smoothly, as if nothing happened. A placement means a displacement somewhere else. A weight needs a counterweight."</p><p>“最初，我只集中研究这一部分，把其他部分都遮起来。为了使端点星运作，就该对端点星下工夫——很有道理，对不对？但是后来我才了解，我不能只在元光体系统中引进这条方程式，就指望它能顺利融入其中，仿佛什么都没有发生过。安置一样东西，便意味着重置别处的另一样东西；一个重量需要另一个重量来平衡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think the concept to which you are referring is what the ancients called din and yang. ' "</p><p>“我想，你提到的这个概念，就是古人所谓的‘阴阳’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, more or less. Yin and yang. So, you see, I realized that to perfect the yin of Terminus, I had to locate its yang. Which I did, over there." She moved back to the violet patch, tucked away at the other edge of the Prime Radiant sphere. "And once I adjusted the figures here, the Terminus equation fell into place as well. Harmony!" Wanda looked pleased with herself, as if she'd solved all the problems of the Empire.</p><p>“是的，差不多。嗯，阴阳。所以，你看，我发觉若想让端点星上的‘阴’十全十美，就必须找出相对的‘阳’。而我做到了，它就在那里。”她又回到那片紫色区域，它藏在元光球面的另一个角落，“只要我调整这里的参数，端点星方程式也会就位。一片圆融！”婉达看来得意洋洋，仿佛她解决了帝国所有的问题。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Fascinating, Wanda, and later on you must tell me what you think it all means for the Project. -But right now you must come with me to the holoscreen. I received an urgent message from Santanni a few minutes ago. Your father wants us to call him immediately."</p><p>“太妙了，婉达，待会儿你一定要告诉我，你认为它对谢顿计划的一切意义。可是现在，你必须跟我到全息屏幕那边。几分钟前，我收到一道来自圣塔尼的紧急电讯，你父亲要我们立刻和他联络。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda's smile faded. She had been alarmed at the recent reports of fighting on Santanni. As Imperial budget cutbacks went into effect, the citizens of the Outer Worlds suffered most. They had limited access to the richer, more populous Inner Worlds and it became more and more difficult to trade their worlds' products for much needed imports. Imperial hyperships going in and out of Santanni were few and the distant world felt isolated from the rest of the Empire. Pockets of rebellion had erupted throughout the planet.</p><p>婉达的笑容随即敛去。最近圣塔尼出现战事的消息令她十分震惊——帝国的预算削减案付诸实施后，外围世界的居民受害最深。从此，他们与较为富庶、较多人口的内围世界交流受到限制，越来越难用他们世界上的产品换取亟需的进口货物。出入圣塔尼的帝国超空间飞船少之又少，使得这个遥远的世界感到孤立于帝国之外。因此在这颗行星各处，爆发了众多零星的叛乱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandfather, I hope everything's all right," said Wanda, her fear revealed by her voice.</p><p>“爷爷，我希望一切平安无事。”婉达说，声音透露了她的恐惧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't worry, dear. After all, they must be safe if Raych was able to send us a message."</p><p>“别担心，亲爱的。无论如何，既然芮奇有办法和我们通讯，他们就一定安全。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In Seldon's office, he and Wanda stood before the holoscreen as it activated. Seldon punched a code on the keypad alongside the screen and they waited a few seconds for the intragalactic connection to be established. Slowly the screen seemed to stretch back into the wall, as if it were the entrance to a tunnel-and out of the tunnel, dimly at first, came the familiar figure of a stocky powerfully built man. As the connection sharpened, the man's features became clearer. When Seldon and Wanda were able to make out Raych's bushy Dahlite mustache, the figure sprang to life.</p><p>来到谢顿的研究室之后，他与婉达站在已启动的全息屏幕前。谢顿在屏幕一侧的键板上敲下一组数码，接下来几秒钟，他们耐心等待着接通跨银河的联系。然后，那幅屏幕似乎开始缓缓向墙内退缩，仿佛成为一个隧道的入口。而从这个隧道里面，逐渐出现一个结实健壮的熟悉人形。这个影像起初模糊不清，但随着信号变得敏锐，那人的外貌也越来越清晰。等到谢顿与婉达能看清芮奇浓密的八字胡之际，这个人形忽然活了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Dad! Wanda!" said Raych's three-dimensional hologram, projected to Trantor from Santanni. "Listen, I don't have much time." He flinched, as if startled by a loud noise. "Things have gotten pretty bad here. The government has fallen and a provisional party has taken over. Things are a mess, as you can imagine. I just put Manella and Bellis on a hypership to Anacreon. I told them to get in touch with you from there. The name of the ship is the Arcadia VII.</p><p>“爸！婉达！”芮奇的三维全息像开了口，它是从圣塔尼一路投影到川陀的，“听好，我没有太多时间。”他畏缩了一下，仿佛被巨大的噪音吓一大跳，“这里的情况变得很糟。政府已经垮台，由一个临时政党接管。一切都乱成一团，你们应该想象得到。我刚把玛妮拉和贝莉丝送上一艘飞往安纳克里昂的超空间飞船，我告诉她们，到了那里再和你们联络，那艘飞船的名字是桃源七号。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You should have seen Manella, Dad. Mad as anything that she had to go. The only way I was able to convince her to leave was to point out that it was for Bellis's sake.</p><p>“你该看看玛妮拉，爸。由于不得不走，她疯得像什么似的。我唯一能说服她离开的理由，是指出那样做是为了贝莉丝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know what you're thinking, Dad and Wanda. Of course I would have gone with them-if I could have. But there wasn't enough room. You should've seen what I had to go through just to get them onto the ship." Raych flashed one of his lopsided grins that Seldon and Wanda loved so much, then continued. "Besides, since I'm here, I have to help guard the University-we may be part of the Imperial University system, but we're a place of learning and building, not of destruction. I tell you, if one of those hot-headed Santanni rebels comes near our stuff……"</p><p>“爸，婉达，我知道你们在想什么。如果我走得了，我当然会跟她们一块走，可是舱位不够。你们应该看看光是把她们送上飞船，我就得花多大力气。”芮奇突然露出一个歪嘴的笑容，那是谢顿与婉达最喜欢见到的。然后他继续说：“此外，既然我在这里，我就必须保卫这所大学。我们或许是帝国大学体系的一环，但我们这里是个学习和建设的地方，不是供人破坏的。我告诉你们，要是哪个昏了头的圣塔尼叛军接近我们……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Raych," Hari broke in, "How bad is it? Are you close to the fighting?"</p><p>“芮奇，”谢顿插嘴道，“情况有多糟？你们接近战区吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Dad, are you in danger?" asked Wanda.</p><p>“爸，你有危险吗？”婉达问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They waited a few seconds for their message to travel the nine thousand parsecs across the Galaxy to Raych.</p><p>他们等了几秒钟，好让讯号在银河中跨越九千秒差距，再送到芮奇面前。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I-I-1 couldn't quite make out what you said," the hologram replied. "There's a bit of fighting going on. It's sort of exciting, actually," Raych said, breaking into that grin again. "So I'm going to sign off now. Remember, find out what happened to the Arcadia III going to Anacreon. I'll be back in touch as soon as I'm able. Remember, I……" The transmission broke off and the hologram faded. The holoscreen tunnel collapsed in on itself so that Seldon and Wanda were left staring at a blank wall.</p><p>“我……我……我听不太清楚你们说什么。”那全息像答道，“有些战斗正在进行，说实在的，还真有几分刺激。”芮奇一面说，一面又歪嘴笑了笑，“所以我现在要结束通话了。记住，查出飞往安纳克里昂的桃源七号下落如何。一旦我有办法，我会立刻再联络你们。记住，我……”传输就此中断，那个全息像迅速消失。全息屏幕隧道随即崩溃，谢顿与婉达只好瞪着一面空洞的墙壁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandpa," said Wanda, "what do you think he was going to say?"</p><p>“爷爷，”婉达说，“你想他正要说什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have no idea, dear. But there is one thing I do know and that is that your father can take care of himself. I pity any rebel who gets near enough for a well-placed Twist-kick from your dad! -Come, let's get back to that equation and in a few hours we'll check on the Arcadia HI. "</p><p>“我没有概念，亲爱的。但有件事我能确定，那就是你父亲能照顾他自己。我真同情那些接近你爸的叛军，他们将正中一记角力踢腿！来吧，我们继续讨论那条方程式，几小时后，我们再来查询桃源七号。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Commander, have you no idea what happened to the ship?" Hari Seldon was again engaged in intragalactic conversation, but this time it was with an Imperial navy commander stationed at Anacreon. For this communication, Seldon was making use of the visiscreen-much less realistic than the holoscreen but also much simpler.</p><p>“司令，你对那艘飞船的下落毫无概念吗？”哈里·谢顿又在进行跨银河的通话，但这回对象是驻守安纳克里昂的皇家舰队司令。在这次通讯中，谢顿使用的是显像屏幕，它的逼真度比全息屏幕差得多，但操作也简单得多。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm telling you, Professor, that we have no record of that hypership requesting permission to enter the Anacreonic atmosphere. Of course, communications with Santanni have been broken for several hours and sporadic at best for the last week. It is possible that the ship tried to reach us on a Santanni-based channel and could not get through, but I doubt it.</p><p>“我告诉您，教授，我们并没有那艘飞船请求进入安纳克里昂大气层的记录。当然，我们和圣塔尼的通讯已经中断好几小时，而一周以来，通讯始终时好时坏。有可能那艘飞船试图以圣塔尼频道和我们联络，结果无法接通，但我不太相信这种事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, it's more likely that the Arcadia 1171 changed destination. Voreg, perhaps, or Sarip. Have you tried either of those worlds, Professor?"</p><p>“更可能的情况，是桃源七号改变了目的地。说不定是伏锐格，或是萨瑞普。您试过那两个世界吗，教授？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Seldon wearily, "but I see no reason if the ship was bound for Anacreon that it would not go to Anacreon. Commander, it is vital that I locate that ship."</p><p>“没有，”谢顿疲倦地说，“但如果飞船的目的地是安纳克里昂，我看不出它有飞到别处的理由。司令，我非得找到那艘飞船不可。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course," the commander ventured, "the Arcadia 1/71 might not have made it. Out safely, I mean. There's a lot of fighting going on. Those rebels don't care who they blow up. They just train their lasers and pretend it's the Emperor Agis they're blasting. I tell you, it's a whole different game out here on the fringe, Professor."</p><p>“当然啦，”司令大胆假设道，“桃源七号也许没能过关。我的意思是，没能安全逃离。现在有许多战斗正在进行，那些叛军可不在乎炸掉的是谁。他们只是瞄准他们的激光，假装他们轰掉的就是艾吉思大帝。我告诉您，在外缘这里，游戏规则可是完全不同，教授。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My daughter-in-law and granddaughter are on that ship, Commander," Seldon said in a tight voice.</p><p>“我的儿媳和孙女在那艘飞船上，司令。”谢顿以僵硬的声音说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, Professor," said an abashed commander. "I'll be in touch with you as soon as I hear anything."</p><p>“喔，我很遗憾，教授。”司令有点不好意思，“一旦我听到任何消息，我会立刻和您联络。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dispiritedly Hari closed the visiscreen contact. How tired I am, he thought. And, he mused, I'm not surprised-I've known that this would come for nearly forty years.</p><p>谢顿垂头丧气地关掉显像屏幕的开关。我多么疲倦啊，他想。不过，他又对自己说，我并不惊讶——将近四十年来，我一直知道这种事迟早会发生。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon chuckled bitterly to himself. Perhaps that commander had thought he was shocking Seldon, impressing him with the vivid detail of life "on the fringe." But Seldon knew all about the fringe. And as the fringe came apart, like a piece of knitting with one loose thread, the whole piece would unravel to the core: Trantor.</p><p>谢顿独自呵呵苦笑几声。说不定那位司令以为吓着了谢顿，令他对“外缘”的生动详情有了深刻认识。其实，谢顿对外缘了若指掌。既然外缘已经开始分裂，那么就像脱了线的织品一样，终将从外缘一路瓦解到核心：川陀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon became aware of a soft buzzing sound. It was the door signal. "Yes?"</p><p>这时谢顿察觉到一阵轻柔的嗡嗡声，那是叫门的讯号。“谁？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandpa," said Wanda, entering the office, "I'm scared."</p><p>“爷爷，”婉达一面说，一面走进研究室，“我害怕。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, dear?" asked Seldon with concern. He didn't want to tell her yet what he had learned-or hadn't learned-from the commander on Anacreon.</p><p>“为什么，亲爱的？”谢顿关切地问道。他还不想告诉她，自己从安纳克里昂司令那里听到些什么，或说没听到些什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Usually, although they're so far away, I feel Dad and Mom and Bellis -feel them in here"-she pointed to her head- `and in here"-she placed her hand over her heart. "But now, today, I don't feel them-it feels less, as if they're fading, like one of the dome bulbs. And I want to stop it. I want to pull them back, but I can't."</p><p>“通常，虽然他们在那么远的地方，我还是感觉得到爸妈和贝莉丝。感觉他们在这里——”她指了指自己的头部，“还有这里——”她又将手摆在心口，“可是现在，今天，我却感觉不到他们。感觉变弱许多，仿佛他们逐渐消失，就像穹顶的那些灯泡。我要阻止这件事，我要把他们拉回来，可是我办不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda, I really think this is merely a product of your concern for your family in light of the rebellion. You know that uprisings occur all over the Empire all the time-little eruptions to let off steam. Come now, you know that chances of anything happening to Raych, Manella, or Bellis are vanishingly small. Your dad will call any day to say all is well; your mom and Bellis will land on Anacreon at any moment and enjoy a little vacation. We are the ones to be pitied-we're stuck here up to our ears in work! So, sweetheart, go to bed and think only good thoughts. I promise you, tomorrow, under the sunny dome, things will look much better."</p><p>“婉达，我认为这是由于那场叛乱，使你担心你的亲人，才会产生这种结果，我真这么想。你也知道，帝国随时随地会发生暴动，就像小规模的火山爆发，好让蒸汽排出来。好啦，你该知道，芮奇、玛妮拉或贝莉丝发生意外的机会微乎其微。你爸明天就可能传来电讯，告诉我们一切平安；你妈和贝莉丝随时可能降落安纳克里昂，享受一个短暂的假期。我们两个才值得同情，我们困在这里，被工作给埋葬！所以说，甜心，去睡觉吧，想些美好的事。我向你保证，到了明天，在晴朗的穹顶之下，一切看来都会好得多。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"All right, Grandpa," said Wanda, not sounding entirely convinced. "But tomorrow-if we haven't heard by tomorrow-we'll have to-to……"</p><p>“好吧，爷爷。”听婉达的口气，她并未完全被说服，“可是明天，如果明天我们还得不到消息，我们就得……就得……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda, what can we do, except wait?" asked Hari, his voice gentle.</p><p>“婉达，除了等待，我们还能做什么呢？”谢顿柔声问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda turned and left, the weight of her worries showing in the slope of her shoulders. Hari watched her go, finally allowing his own worries to come to the surface.</p><p>婉达转身离去，她心头的重担呈现在她耷拉着的肩头。谢顿目送她走远后，终于让自己的忧虑浮现出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It had been three days since the hologram transmission from Raych. Since then-nothing. And today the naval commander at Anacreon denied ever having heard of a ship called Arcadia VII</p><p>自从芮奇传回全息像，至今已经三天了。在那之后，就没有任何消息。而今天，安纳克里昂的舰队司令，竟然否认听过有这么一艘番号为“桃源七号”的飞船。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari had tried earlier to get through to Raych on Santanni, but all communication beams were down. It was as if Santanni-and the Arcadia VII-had simply broken off from the Empire, like a petal from a flower.</p><p>早先，谢顿曾试图与位于圣塔尼的芮奇通话，可是所有的通讯波束都断了。仿佛圣塔尼——以及桃源七号——已经双双脱离帝国，就像从花朵脱落的两片花瓣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon knew what he had to do now. The Empire might be down, but it was not out. Its power, when properly wielded, was still awesome. Seldon placed an emergency transmission to Emperor Agis XIV.</p><p>谢顿知道现在必须怎么做。帝国或许在走下坡，可是尚未跌落谷底。它的力量若是使用得当，仍然具有骇人的威力。于是，谢顿向艾吉思大帝十四世送出一道紧急电讯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>29</p><p>29</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What a surprise-my friend Hari!" Agis's visage beamed at Seldon through the holoscreen. "I am glad to hear from you, although you usually request the more formal personal audience. Come, you've piqued my interest. Why the urgency?"</p><p>“天大的惊喜，我的好友哈里！”艾吉思的面容透过全息屏幕冲着谢顿微笑，“我很高兴你和我联络，虽然你通常都要求更正式的觐见。说吧，你勾起了我的好奇心。为何如此紧急？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sire," began Seldon, "my son, Raych, and his wife and daughter live on Santanni."</p><p>“陛下，”谢顿开口道，“我儿子芮奇，还有他的妻子和女儿都住在圣塔尼。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah, Santanni," the Emperor said as his smile faded. "A bunch of misguided wretches if I ever……"</p><p>“啊，圣塔尼。”皇帝的笑容随即敛去，“一伙误入歧途的无耻之徒，要是我……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sire, please," broke in Seldon, surprising both the Emperor and himself with this flagrant breach of Imperial protocol. "My son was able to get Manella and Bellis onto a hypership, the Arcadia VII, bound for Anacreon. He, however, had to remain. That was three days ago. The ship has not landed at Anacreon. And my son seems to have disappeared. My calls to Santanni have gone unanswered and now the communication beams are broken.</p><p>“陛下，拜托。”谢顿打断皇帝的话，这种大逆不道的行径，令皇帝与他自己都大吃一惊，“我儿子想尽办法，把玛妮拉和贝莉丝送上一艘飞往安纳克里昂的超空间飞船桃源七号。然而，他自己不得不留下来。那是三天前的事，结果那艘飞船没有在安纳克里昂着陆，而我儿子似乎也失踪了。我送到圣塔尼的电讯得不到回音，现在通讯波束也断了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Please, Sire, can you help me?"</p><p>“拜托，陛下，您能帮助我吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari, as you know, officially all ties between Santanni and Trantor have been severed. However, I still hold some influence in selected areas of Santanni. That is, there are still a few loyal to me who have not yet been found out. Although I cannot make direct contact with any of my operatives on that world, I can share with you any reports I receive from there. These are, of course, highly confidential, but considering your situation and our relationship, I will allow you access to those pieces that might interest you.</p><p>“哈里，你也知道，圣塔尼和川陀间的正式联系通通切断了。然而，我在圣塔尼某些地区仍有些影响力。也就是说，仍有些忠于我的人还没给搜出来。虽然我无法和那个世界上任何情报员直接接触，我至少能将收到的报告都和你分享。当然，那些都是高度机密，但是念在你的情况以及我们的交情，我将准许你接触那些你或许感兴趣的资料。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am expecting another dispatch within the hour. If you like, I'll recontact you when it arrives. In the meantime, I'll have one of my aides go over all transmissions from Santanni for the past three days to look for anything pertaining to Raych, Manella, or Bellis Seldon."</p><p>“我正在等另一份急件，一小时内会到。你若是有兴趣，等它送来后我会再和你联络。与此同时，我会叫一名助理细查过去这三天来自圣塔尼的通讯，搜寻任何与芮奇·谢顿、玛妮拉·谢顿或贝莉丝·谢顿有关的记录。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you, Sire. I thank you most humbly." And Hari Seldon dipped his head as the Emperor's image faded from the holoscreen.</p><p>“谢谢您，陛下，我诚心诚意感谢您。”当皇帝的影像从全息屏幕淡出时，哈里·谢顿低下头来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sixty minutes later Hari Seldon was still sitting at his desk, waiting to hear from the Emperor. The past hour had been one of the most difficult he had ever spent, second only to the hours after Dors's destruction.</p><p>六十分钟后，哈里·谢顿仍坐在书桌前，等待着皇帝的消息。过去这一个钟头，是他一生中最难熬的经历之一，仅次于铎丝被毁之后的数个小时。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was the not knowing that did Hari in. He had made a career of knowing-the future as well as the present. And now he had no idea at all about three of the people most precious to him.</p><p>击败谢顿的是那个未知数。他一生都在处理已知数——不但知晓目前，还能预测未来。而现在，他最珍爱的三个人却完全下落不明。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The holoscreen buzzed softly and Hari pressed a contact in response. Agis appeared.</p><p>全息屏幕发出轻柔的嗡嗡声，谢顿按下一个开关，艾吉思便出现了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari," began the Emperor. From the soft slow sadness in his voice, Hari knew this call brought bad news.</p><p>“哈里。”皇帝开口道。听到他声音中透着柔缓的悲伤，谢顿就知道这次通讯带来了坏消息。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My son," said Hari.</p><p>“我儿子……”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," replied the Emperor. "Raych was killed, earlier today, in a bombardment on Santanni University. I've learned from my sources that Raych knew the attack was coming but refused to desert his post. You see, a good number of the rebels are students and Raych felt that if they knew that he was still there, they would never. ....But hate overcame all reason.</p><p>“是的，”皇帝答道，“芮奇遇害了。那是今天稍早的事，他死于圣塔尼大学所遭到的一场轰炸。我的情报来源告诉我，芮奇明知对方即将发动攻击，但他拒绝离开他的岗位。你可知道，好些叛军都是学生，芮奇觉得他们要是知道他仍在那里，就绝不会……可是仇恨战胜了一切理智。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The University is, you see, an Imperial University. The rebels feel they must destroy all things Imperial before rebuilding anew. The fools! Why……" And here Agis stopped, as if suddenly realizing that Seldon did not care about Santanni University or the plans of the rebels-not right now, at least.</p><p>“那所大学，你也知道，是一所帝国大学。叛军觉得必须摧毁冠上帝国的一切，他们才能重新建设。这些傻瓜！为什么……”说到这里艾吉思住了口，仿佛突然察觉谢顿对圣塔尼大学或是那些叛军的计划都毫不关心，至少现在绝不关心。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari, if it makes you feel any better, remember that your son died in defense of knowledge. It was not the Empire Raych fought and died for but humanity itself."</p><p>“哈里，记住你儿子是为了保卫知识而捐躯的，这也许能让你觉得好过一点。芮奇战死并不是为了帝国，而是为了整个人类。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked up out of tear-filled eyes. Weakly he asked, "And Manella and little Bellis? What of them? Have you found the Arcadia Hl?"</p><p>谢顿抬起头来，双眼盈满泪水。他虚弱地说：“玛妮拉和小贝莉丝呢？她们怎么样？您有没有找到桃源七号？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That search has proved fruitless, Hari. The Arcadia VII left Santanni, as you were told..But it seems to have disappeared. It may have been hijacked by rebels or it may have made an emergency detour-at this point, we just don't know."</p><p>“搜寻没有任何结果，哈里。正如你听说的那样，桃源七号离开了圣塔尼，但它现在似乎已经失踪。它也许是被叛军劫持了，也许是做了紧急改道——此时此刻，我们根本无从得知。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded.."Thank you, Agis. Although you have brought me tragic news, at least you have brought it. Not knowing was worse. You are a true friend."</p><p>谢顿点了点头。“谢谢您，艾吉思。虽然您给我带来噩耗，但至少您带来了。生死未卜还要更糟，您是我真正的朋友。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And so, my friend," said the Emperor, "I'll leave you to yourself now-and your memories." The Emperor's image faded from the screen as Hari Seldon folded his arms in front of him on his desk, put his head down, and wept.</p><p>“好了，我的朋友，”皇帝说，“现在我要把你的时间留给你自己，还有你的回忆。”皇帝的影像从屏幕中逐渐消失，哈里·谢顿则将双臂叠在书桌上，伏下头来，开始哭泣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>30</p><p>30</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda Seldon adjusted the waistband of her unisuit, pulling it a little tighter around her middle. Taking up a hand hoe, she attacked some weeds that had sprung up in her small flower garden outside the Psychohistory.Building at Streeling. Generally Wanda spent the bulk of her time in her office, working with her Prime Radiant. She found solace in its precise statistical elegance; the unvarying equations were somehow reassuring in this Empire gone so crazy. But when thoughts of her beloved father, mother, and baby sister became too much to bear, when even her research could not keep her mind off the horrible losses she'd so recently undergone, Wanda invariably found herself out here, scratching at the terraformed ground, as if coaxing a few plants to life might somehow, in some tiny measure, ameliorate her pain.</p><p>婉达·谢顿调整了一下连身服的腰带，将它稍微拉紧一点。她在位于斯璀璘的心理史学大楼外辟了一个小花园，此时她拿着一把小铲子，正在对付刚发芽的杂草。一般说来，婉达大部分时间都待在研究室，利用她的元光体进行研究工作。从其中精确的、统计性的优雅，她找到了一份安慰；在这个变得如此疯狂的帝国中，那些不变的方程式总是能使人感到心安。但是，每当她对父亲、母亲与小妹妹的怀念变得难以承受，每当研究工作也无法使她暂时忘却最近的惨痛打击，婉达总会来到这里，扒梳着经过改造的土壤。仿佛养活几株植物，便能在某一方面、某个微小的程度上减轻她的痛苦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Since her father's death a month ago and the disappearance of Manella and Bellis, Wanda, who had always been slim, had been losing weight. Whereas a few months ago Hari Seldon would have been concerned over his darling granddaughter's loss of appetite, now he, stuck in his own grief, seemed not to notice.</p><p>自从一个月前，她的父亲过世，而玛妮拉与贝莉丝双双失踪之后，原本一向苗条的婉达，更是一路消瘦下来。若是几个月前，哈里·谢顿会为心爱的孙女失去胃口而操心不已，可是如今，他自己深陷于悲痛中，似乎也就未曾留意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A profound change had come over Hari and Wanda Seldon-and the few remaining members of the Psychohistory.Project. Hari seemed to have given up. He now spent most of his days sitting in an armchair in the Streeling solarium, staring out at the University grounds, warmed by the bright bulbs overhead. Occasionally Project members told Wanda that his bodyguard, a man named Stettin Palver, would badger Seldon into a walk out under the dome or try.to engage him in a discussion of the future direction of the Project.</p><p>哈里·谢顿与婉达·谢顿都有了深刻的转变，心理史学计划所剩无几的人员也不例外。老谢顿似乎已经放弃了，现在，他大多时间都泡在斯璀璘日光浴馆，坐在一张扶手椅上，借着头顶明亮的灯泡取暖，望着外面的校园景致。计划成员偶尔会告诉婉达，说谢顿的保镖，一位名叫史铁亭·帕佛的人，会苦口婆心地劝他到穹顶之下散散步，或是试着引他讨论谢顿计划未来的方向。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda retreated deeper into her study of the Prime Radiant's fascinating equations. She could feel the future her grandfather had worked so hard to achieve finally taking shape, and he was right: The Encyclopedists must be established on Terminus; they would be the Foundation.</p><p>婉达则更加努力研究元光体中那些奇妙的方程式，以此作为一种逃避。她能够感觉到，她的祖父一生竭尽心力所创造的未来，如今终于逐渐成形，而他是对的：百科全书编者必须在端点星扎根，他们将是基地的种子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Section 33A2D17-in it Wanda could see what Seldon referred to as the Second, or secret, Foundation. But how? Without Seldon's active interest, Wanda was at a loss as to how to proceed. And her sorrow over the destruction of her family cut so deep that she didn't seem to have the strength to figure it out.</p><p>至于33a2d17节，从那里面，婉达能够看到谢顿所指的第二基地，或曰秘密基地。可是怎么做呢？没有谢顿的积极投入，婉达茫然不知如何进行。而家庭破碎所带来的悲痛，对她的伤害又是那么深，使她几乎没有力气找出答案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The members of the Project itself, those fifty or so hardy souls who remained, continued their work as well as possible. The majority were Encyclopedists, researching the source materials they would need to copy and catalogue for their eventual move to Terminus-when and if they gained full access to the Galactic Library. At this point, they were working on faith alone. Professor Seldon had lost his private office at the Library, so the prospects of any other Project member gaining special access were slim.</p><p>谢顿计划本身的成员，那五十来个留下来的死忠者，则尽可能继续他们的工作。他们大多是百科全书编者，负责追查他们需要复制与编目的原始资料，为迁移端点星这个最终目标进行准备。但唯有获得帝国图书馆的完全使用权，他们才能着手实际的工作。此时此刻，他们仅仅凭借着信心继续苦撑。谢顿教授已失去了他在那座图书馆中的个人研究室，所以其他成员获得特权的机会更是微乎其微。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The remaining Project members (other than the Encyclopedists) were historical analysts and mathematicians. The historians interpreted past and current human actions and events, turning their findings over to the mathematicians, who in turn fit those pieces into the great Psychohistorical Equation. It was long painstaking work.</p><p>谢顿计划的其余成员（不算百科全书编者）则是历史分析员与数学家。历史学家负责诠释过去与当今的人类活动以及事件，然后将他们的发现交给数学家，后者再将这些成果代入伟大的心理史学方程式。这是个既冗长又费心费力的工作。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Many Project members had left because the rewards were so few-psychohistorians were the butt of many jokes on Trantor and limited funds had forced Seldon to enact drastic pay cuts. But the constant reassuring presence of Hari Seldon had-till now-overcome the difficult working conditions of the Project. Indeed, the Project members who had stayed on had, to a person, done so out of respect and devotion to Professor Seldon.</p><p>不少计划成员已经离去，因为回报少之又少——心理史学家成了川陀上许多新笑话的题材，有限的经费又迫使谢顿采取大幅减薪的措施。但是过去，哈里·谢顿经常不断出现在众人面前，他所带来的信心克服了困难的工作环境。事实上，那些坚守岗位的计划成员，每个人之所以这样做，纯粹都是出于对谢顿教授的尊敬与忠心。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, thought Wanda Seldon bitterly, what reason is left for them to stay? A light breeze blew a piece of her blond hair across her eyes; she pushed it back absentmindedly and continued her weeding.</p><p>现在，婉达·谢顿凄苦地想，他们还有什么理由留下来呢？一阵微风将她的一绺金发吹到眼前，她漫不经心地把它拨开，继续她的除草工作。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Miss Seldon, may I have a moment of your time?" Wanda turned and looked up. A young man-she judged him to be in his early twenties -stood on the gravel path next to her. She immediately sensed him to be strong and fearsomely intelligent. Her grandfather had chosen wisely. Wanda rose to speak with him.</p><p>“谢顿小姐，我能占用你一点时间吗？”婉达转头抬眼望去，那是个年轻人（她判断他才二十出头），站在她身边的碎石子小径上。她立刻感知他是个强壮且聪明过人的人，她的祖父作了一个精明的选择。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I recognize you. You are my grandfather's bodyguard, are you not? Stettin Palver, I believe?"</p><p>婉达站起来，开始与他交谈。“我认得你，你是我祖父的保镖，对不对？史铁亭·帕佛，是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, that's correct, Miss Seldon," Palver said and his cheeks reddened slightly, as if he were pleased that so pretty a girl should have given him any notice. "Miss Seldon, it is your grandfather I'd like to talk to you about. I'm very worried about him. We must do something."</p><p>“是的，完全正确，谢顿小姐。”帕佛的双颊微微泛红，仿佛很高兴这么漂亮的女孩竟然留意到他，“谢顿小姐，我希望和你谈谈令祖父。我非常担心他，我们必须做点什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do what, Mr. Palver? I am at a loss. Since my father"-she swallowed hard, as if she were having difficulty speaking……"died and my mother and sister disappeared, it is all I can do to get him out of bed in the morning. And to tell you the truth, it has affected me very deeply as well. You understand, don't you?" She looked into his eyes and knew that he did.</p><p>“做什么呢，帕佛先生？我摸不着头绪。自从我父亲——”她吃力地咽了一下口水，仿佛难以说出口，“——过世，而我母亲和妹妹失踪后，我唯一能做的，只是每天早上拉他起床。而且告诉你一句实话，这个变故也深深影响了我。你该了解，对不对？”她望向他的双眼，便明白他的确了解。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Miss Seldon," Palver said softly, "I am terribly sorry about your losses. But you and Professor Seldon are alive and you must keep working at psychohistory. The professor seems to have given up. I was hoping that maybe you-we-could come up with something to give him hope again. You know, a reason to go on."</p><p>“谢顿小姐，”帕佛轻声道，“对于你痛失亲人，我感到万分遗憾。可是你和谢顿教授还活着，你们的心理史学研究必须继续下去。教授似乎已经放弃，我是希望也许你——我们——能够做点什么，好给他一点新希望。你该知道，就是一个撑下去的理由。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Ah, Mr. Palver, thought Wanda, maybe Grandpa has it right. 1 wonder if there truly is any reason to go on. But she said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Palver, I can think of nothing." She gestured toward the ground with her hoe. "And now, as you can see, I must get back to these pesky weeds."</p><p>啊，帕佛先生，婉达想道，也许爷爷是对的，我怀疑是否真有任何撑下去的理由。但她却说：“很抱歉，帕佛先生，我想不出什么办法。”她用小铲子指了指地面，“现在，你也看得出来，我必须继续对付这些讨厌的杂草。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't think your grandfather has got it right. I think there truly is a reason to go on. We just have to find it."</p><p>“我并不认为令祖父的想法是对的。我认为确实有个撑下去的理由，我们必须把它找出来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The words struck her with full force. How had he known what she had been thinking? Unless- "You can handle minds, can't you?" Wanda asked, holding her breath, as if afraid to hear Palver's response.</p><p>这番话重重打在她的心头。他怎么知道她刚才在想什么？除非……“你能透视心灵，对不对？”婉达问完，便屏住气息，仿佛害怕听到帕佛的回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I can," the young man replied. "I always have, I think. At least, I can't remember not doing it. Half the time I'm not even consciously aware of it-I just know what people are thinking-or have thought.</p><p>“是的，我有这个能力。”年轻人答道，“我想，我一直都可以。至少，我不记得有什么时候不能。有一半的时间，我甚至不会意识到这件事。我就是知道人们在想什么，或是想过什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sometimes," he continued, encouraged by the understanding he felt emanating from Wanda, "I get flashes of it coming from someone else. It's always in a crowd, though, and I can't locate whoever it is. But I know there are others like me-us-around."</p><p>“有些时候，”感到婉达散发出了解的讯息，给了他很大鼓励，于是他继续说，“我会接收到来自他人的灵光，不过总是在人群中，我找不到究竟是谁发出的。但我知道周遭还有其他像我——像我们这样的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda grabbed Palver's hand excitedly, her gardening tool tossed to the ground, forgotten. "Have you any idea what this might mean? For Grandpa, for psychohistory? One of us alone can do only so much, but both of us together……" Wanda started walking into the Psychohistory Building, leaving Palver standing on the gravel path. Almost to the entrance she stopped and turned. Come, Mr. Palver, we must tell my grandfather, Wanda said without opening her mouth. Yes, 1 suppose we should, answered Palver as he joined her.</p><p>婉达兴奋地抓住帕佛的手，她的园艺工具早已丢到地上。“你可知道，无论是对爷爷，或是对心理史学，这可能代表什么意义吗？我们单独一人只能发挥有限的威力，但我们两人联手……”婉达迈步走向心理史学大楼，留下帕佛站在碎石子小径上。在将要走到入口时，她停下脚步，转过身来。来吧，帕佛先生，我们一定要告诉我祖父。婉达闭着嘴巴‘说’。是的，我想我们应该这么做。帕佛一面向她走去，一面这么回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>31</p><p>31</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you mean to say I have been searching Trantor-wide for someone with your powers, Wanda, and he's been here with us for the past few months and we never knew it?" Hari Seldon was incredulous. He had been dozing in the solarium when Wanda and Palver shook him awake to give him their amazing news.</p><p>“你的意思是，婉达，我寻遍川陀，想找个具有你那种能力的人，结果这几个月来，他一直在我们身边，而我们始终不知道？”哈里·谢顿简直不敢置信。当婉达与帕佛将他摇醒，带来这个惊人消息时，他正在日光浴馆里打盹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Grandpa. Think about it. I've never had occasion to meet Stettin. Your time with him has primarily been away from the Project and I spend the majority of my time closeted in my office, working with the Prime Radiant. When would we have met? In fact, the one time our paths did cross, the results were most significant."</p><p>“是的，爷爷。想想看，我从来没机会遇见史铁亭。你和他在一起的时候，大多不是在心理史学大楼，而我大部分的时间，都关在自己的研究室，利用元光体在进行研究。我们什么时候会碰面呢？事实上，我们的轨迹确实交会过一次，产生的结果影响深远。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"When was that?" asked Seldon, searching his memory.</p><p>“是什么时候？”谢顿一面问，一面搜寻着自己的记忆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Your last hearing-before Judge Lih," Wanda replied immediately. "Remember the eyewitness who swore that you and Stettin had attacked those three muggers? Remember how he broke down and told the truth -and even he didn't seem to know why. But Stettin and I have pieced it together. We were both pushing Rial Nevas to come clean. He had been very steadfast in his original claim; I doubt that either one of us would have been able to push him alone. But together"-she stole a shy glance at Palver, who was standing off to the side……"our power is awesome!"</p><p>“你上次的听证会，李赫法官主持的那次。”婉达立刻答道，“还记得那个目击者吗？他发誓说你和史铁亭曾经攻击那三个箍颈党。还记得他是如何崩溃，说出了实情，连他自己似乎也不知道怎么回事吗？史铁亭和我把真相拼凑了出来，当时我们都在推莱耳·纳瓦斯，都在逼他说实话。在他原先的申述中，他说得非常斩钉截铁；我不信我们单独一人推得动他。可是两人联手——”她偷偷地羞羞地瞥了一眼站在老远的帕佛，“我们的力量就很吓人！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon took all this in and then made as if to speak. But Wanda continued. "In fact, we plan to spend the afternoon testing our mentalic abilities, separately and together. From the little we've discovered so far, it seems as if Stettin's power is slightly lower than mine-perhaps a five on my rating scale. But his five, combined with my seven, gives us a twelve! Think of it, Grandpa. Awesome!"</p><p>哈里·谢顿将这一切听了进去，然后仿佛想要开口。可是婉达继续说：“事实上，我们计划今天下午来测试我们的精神能力，个别的，以及联合的。根据我们目前发现的一点点，史铁亭的力量似乎比我稍微弱些，在我的评量标度上也许是五级。可是他的五级，和我的七级结合，就得到十二级！想想看，爷爷，多吓人！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't you see, Professor?" Palver spoke up. "Wanda and I are that breakthrough you're looking for. We can help you convince the worlds of the validity of psychohistory, we can help find others like us, we can help put psychohistory back on track."</p><p>“你看不出来吗，教授？”帕佛高声道，“婉达和我就是你在寻找的突破。我们能帮助你说服所有的世界，让大家都相信心理史学的效力；我们能帮助你找到其他像我们这样的人；我们能帮助你让心理史学重新出发。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon gazed up at the two young people standing in front of him. Their faces were aglow with youth and vigor and enthusiasm and he realized it did his old heart good. Perhaps all was not lost, after all. He had not thought he would survive this latest tragedy, the death of his son and the disappearance of his son's wife and child, but now he could see that Raych lived on in Wanda. And in Wanda and Stettin, he now knew, lived the future of the Foundation.</p><p>哈里·谢顿抬头凝视着站在面前的两个年轻人，他们的脸庞燃烧着青春、活力与热情，他体会到自己因而老怀大慰。毕竟，或许尚未一败涂地。本来，他的儿子死了，他的儿媳与孙女失踪了，他从未想到会撑得过这个悲惨的打击，但是现在，他能看到芮奇活在婉达体内。而且现在他也知道，基地的未来寄托在婉达与帕佛身上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, yes," agreed Seldon nodding forcefully. "Come you two, help me up. I must get back to my office to plan our next step."</p><p>“是啊，是啊。”谢顿猛力点着头，“你们两个，扶我起来。我必须回到我的研究室，计划我们下一步的行动。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>32</p><p>32</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Professor Seldon come in," said Chief Librarian Tryma Acarnio in an icy tone of voice. Hari Seldon accompanied by Wanda and Palver, entered the Chief Librarian's imposing office.</p><p>“谢顿教授，进来吧。”垂玛·阿卡尼欧馆长以冰冷的口气说。于是哈里·谢顿，以及同行的婉达与帕佛，走进了堂皇的馆长办公室。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you, Chief Librarian," said Seldon as he settled into a chair and faced Acarnio across the vast desk. "May I introduce my granddaughter Wanda and my friend Stettin Palver. Wanda is a most valuable member of the Psychohistory Project, her specialty being in the field of mathematics. And Stettin, well, Stettin is turning into a first-rate general psychohistorian-when he's not performing his duties as my bodyguard, that is." Seldon chuckled amiably.</p><p>“谢谢您，馆长。”谢顿在一张椅子上坐下来，正好隔着宽大的办公桌面对阿卡尼欧，“请容我介绍我的孙女婉达，还有我的朋友史铁亭·帕佛。婉达是心理史学计划中最有价值的成员之一，她的专长领域是数学。至于史铁亭嘛，史铁亭即将成为一流的普通心理史学家——我的意思是，在他担任我的保镖工作之余。”谢顿亲切地咯咯笑了几声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, well, that's all well and good, Professor," said Acarnio, baffled by Seldon's good humor. He had expected the professor to come in groveling, begging for another chance at special Library privileges.</p><p>“是的，很好，一切都很好，教授。”阿卡尼欧随口应道，谢顿的好心情令他困惑不已。他原本预料这位教授是来摇尾乞怜，乞求图书馆再赏他一次特权。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I don't understand what it is you wanted to see me about. I assume you realize that our position is firm: We cannot allow a Library association with someone so extremely unpopular with the general population. We are, after all, a public library and we must keep the public's sentiments in mind." Acarnio settled back-perhaps now the groveling would begin.</p><p>“但我不了解你想见我是为了什么。我假定你明白我们的坚定立场：一个在众人眼中极不受欢迎的人物，我们不能准许本馆与他合作。毕竟，我们是一个公众图书馆，我们必须将公众的好恶放在心上。”阿卡尼欧上身靠向椅背——现在，或许摇尾乞怜会开始了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I realize that I have not been able to sway you. However, I thought that if you heard from a couple of the Project's younger members-the psychohistorians of tomorrow, as it were-that perhaps you'd get a better feel about what a vital role the Project-and the Encyclopedia, in particular-will play in our future. Please hear Wanda and Stettin out."</p><p>“我明白自己始终无法动摇您。然而，我想，如果您听听谢顿计划的两位年轻成员——两位明日的心理史学家怎么说，或许您将对谢顿计划——尤其是那套百科全书——在我们的未来将扮演多重要的角色，会有比较深入的印象。请务必听完婉达和史铁亭的一番话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Acarnio cast a cold eye toward the two young people flanking Seldon. "Very well, then," he said, pointedly eyeing the timestrip on the wall. "Five minutes and no more. I have a Library to run."</p><p>阿卡尼欧以冷漠的目光望了望谢顿身边的两个年轻人。“很好。”说完，他刻意瞄了一眼墙上的计时片，“五分钟，不能再多，我有个图书馆要照顾。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Chief Librarian," began Wanda, "as my grandfather has undoubtedly explained to you, psychohistory is a most valuable tool to be used for the preservation of our culture. Yes, preservation, " she repeated, upon seeing Acarnio's eyes widen at the word. "Undue emphasis has been placed on the destruction of the Empire. By doing so, the true value of psychohistory has been overlooked. For, with psychohistory, as we are able to predict the inevitable decline of our civilization, so are we able to take steps toward its preservation. That is what the Encyclopedia Galactica is all about. And that is why we need your help, and the help of your great Library."</p><p>“馆长，”婉达开始说，“想必我祖父一定对您解释过，想要保存我们的文化，心理史学是最重要的一项工具。没错，是保存！”看到阿卡尼欧听到那两个字便张大眼睛，她特别重复了一遍，“人们过分强调帝国的毁灭，这样一来，便忽略了心理史学的真正价值。因为，既然借着心理史学，我们得以预测文明必将没落，同理就能设法保存这个文明。那正是《银河百科全书》的目的，那也正是我们需要您，以及您这座伟大的图书馆襄助的原因。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Acarnio could not resist smiling. The young lady had an undeniable charm. She was so earnest, so well spoken. He gazed at her sitting in front of him, her blond hair pulled back in a rather severe scholarly style, one which could not hide her attractive features but, rather, showed them off. What she was saying was starting to make sense. Maybe Wanda Seldon was right-maybe he had been looking at this problem from the wrong angle. If it were actually a matter of preservation, rather than destruction . </p><p>阿卡尼欧忍不住露出笑容。这位小姐拥有无可否认的魅力，她是那么认真，那么能言善道。他凝望着坐在自己面前的她，她的金发向后扎成相当雅致的学者发型，却无法隐藏她迷人的容貌，反倒更加衬托她的美丽。而且，她说的话越听越有道理。也许婉达·谢顿是对的，也许他一直从错误的角度看这个问题。假如重点真是‘保存’，而不是‘毁灭’……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Chief Librarian," began Stettin Palver, "this great Library has stood for millennia. It, perhaps even more than the Imperial Palace, represents the vast power of the Empire. For, the Palace houses only the Empire's leader, while the Library is home to the sum total of Imperial knowledge, culture, and history. Its value is incalculable </p><p>“馆长，”史铁亭·帕佛开口道，“这座伟大的图书馆屹立了数千年，或许甚至比皇宫更能代表帝国庞大的实力。因为，皇宫中仅仅住着帝国的领导者，这座图书馆则典藏了帝国所累积的一切知识、文化与历史，它的价值难以计数。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does it not make sense to prepare a tribute to this great repository? The Encyclopedia Galactica will be just that-a giant summary of all the knowledge contained within these very walls. Think of it!"</p><p>“难道不该为这个伟大的知识宝库准备一篇赞辞吗？《银河百科全书》就是这样的一篇赞辞，它是此间所有知识的浩大摘要。想想看！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All of a sudden it seemed so very clear to Acarnio. How could he have let the Board (especially that sourpuss Gennaro Mummery) convince him to rescind Seldon's privileges? Las Zenow, a person whose judgment he greatly esteemed, had been a wholehearted supporter of Seldon's Encyclopedia.</p><p>突然间，阿卡尼欧似乎彻底想通了。他怎能让评议会（尤其是那个不安好心的吉纳洛·麻莫瑞）说服他取消谢顿的特权？拉斯·齐诺过去一直全心全意支持谢顿的百科全书，而自己一向多么尊重他的判断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He glanced again at the three in front of him, waiting for his decision. The Board would be hard-pressed to find anything to complain about with the Project members-if the young people now in his office were a representative sample of the kind of persons involved with Seldon </p><p>他再瞥了一眼面前这三个人，他们正在等待他的决定。倘若面前的两位青年，就是谢顿手下那些人的代表，那么评议会将发现，谢顿计划的成员实在没有什么好挑剔的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Acarnio rose and walked across his office, his brow furrowed, as if framing his thoughts. He picked up a milky crystal sphere from a table and hefted it in his palm </p><p>阿卡尼欧站了起来，走到办公室另一头，他的眉头深锁，仿佛锁住他的思绪。他从一张桌子上抓起一个乳白色水晶球，拿在手中掂了又掂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Trantor," Acarnio began thoughtfully, "seat of the Empire, center of all the Galaxy. Quite amazing, when you think of it. -We have, perhaps, been too quick to judge Professor Seldon Now that your Project, this Encyclopedia Galactica, has been presented to me in such a light"-he gave a brief nod to Wanda and Palver……"I realize how important it would be to allow you to continue your work here. And, of course, to grant access to a number of your colleagues."</p><p>“川陀，”阿卡尼欧意味深长地说，“帝国的中枢，整个银河的核心。当你想到这一点，总会觉得相当不可思议。或许，我们对谢顿教授太快妄下断语。现在，既然您的计划，这个《银河百科全书》，以这种方式呈现在我眼前，”他对婉达与帕佛很快点了点头，“使我了解到，准许您继续在这里工作，当然还有批准您的一批同事加入，会是一件多么重要的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon smiled gratefully and squeezed Wanda's hand </p><p>谢顿露出感激的笑容，紧紧捏住婉达的手。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is not only for the greater glory of the Empire that I am recommending this," continued Acarnio, apparently warming to the idea (and the sound of his own voice). "You are famous, Professor Seldon Whether people think of you as a crackpot or a genius, everyone seems to have an opinion. If an academic of your stature is allied with the Galactic Library, it can only increase our prestige as a bastion of intellectual pursuit of the highest order. Why, the luster of your presence can be used to raise much-needed funds to update our collections, increase our staff, keep our doors open to the public longer . </p><p>“我支持这件事，不只是为了给帝国的光荣锦上添花。”阿卡尼欧继续说，显然对这个构想（以及他自己的声音）越来越感兴趣，“您大有名气，谢顿教授。不论人们认为您是个狂人或天才，反正人人似乎都有自己的看法。能有一位像您这么有地位的学者与帝国图书馆合作，唯一的结果就是增加我们的声望，让大家都知道我们是进行最高学术研究的城堡。啊，我们可以借您的光，来筹募亟需的经费，以更新我们的搜藏，增添我们的人手，好让我们的大门能对公众开放得更久……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And the prospect of the Encyclopedia Galactica itself-what a monumental project! Imagine the reaction when the public learns that the Galactic Library is involved with such an undertaking designed to highlight the splendor of our civilization-our glorious history, our brilliant achievements, our magnificent cultures. And to think that I, Chief Librarian Tryma Acarnio, is responsible for making sure that this great Project gets its start……" Acarnio gazed intently into the crystal sphere, lost in reverie </p><p>“至于《银河百科全书》本身的展望——多么不朽的一个计划！这样一个大工程，目的是要将我们的文明光辉聚焦——凸显我们光荣的历史、我们灿烂的成就、我们辉煌的文化——试想当公众获悉帝国图书馆有幸参与，将会出现什么反应。再想想我自己，垂玛·阿卡尼欧馆长，负责一手推动这个伟大的计划……”阿卡尼欧专心凝视着那个水晶球，沉醉在自己的幻想中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Professor Seldon," Acarnio pulled himself back to the here and now. "You and your colleagues will be granted full insiders' privileges-and a suite of offices in which to work." He placed the crystal sphere back on its table and, with a swish of robes, moved back to his desk </p><p>“好的，谢顿教授。”阿卡尼欧将心神拉回此时此地，“您和您的同事将获准拥有自己人的完全特权，以及一大间办公室供你们使用。”他将水晶球放回桌上，在长袍带起的一阵沙沙声中走回办公桌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It might take a little doing, of course, to persuade the Board-but I am confident that I can handle them. Just leave it to me."</p><p>“当然，可能需要花点工夫说服评议会。但我有信心能应付他们，一切交给我就行了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon, Wanda, and Palver looked at each other in triumph, with small smiles playing at the corner of their mouths. Tryma Acarnio gestured that they could go and so they did, leaving the Chief Librarian settled in his chair, dreaming of the glory and honor that would come to the Library under his aegis </p><p>谢顿、婉达与帕佛欢欣鼓舞地相互对望，嘴角都挂着浅浅的笑容。垂玛·阿卡尼欧作势表示他们可以走了，三人便随即告辞，留下馆长坐在座椅中，梦想着在他的主持下，这座图书馆将获得的光荣与声誉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Amazing," said Seldon when the three were safely ensconced in their ground-car. "If you could have seen him at our last meeting. He said I was `threatening the essential fabric of our Empire' or some such rot. And today, after just a few minutes with you two……"</p><p>“不可思议。”他们三人躲进地面车后，谢顿这样说，“你们该看看他上次见我的那副嘴脸，他说我‘正在威胁帝国的根本’或诸如此类的鬼话。而今天，仅仅和你们两个谈了几分钟……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It wasn't too hard, Grandpa," Wanda said as she pressed a contact, moving the ground-car out into traffic. She sat back as the auto-propel took over; Wanda had punched their destination coordinates into the control panel. "He is a man with a strong sense of self-importance. All we had to do was play up the positive aspects of the Encyclopedia and his ego took over from there."</p><p>“这并不太难，爷爷。”婉达按下一个开关，将地面车开到路上。等到自动推进系统接管后，她便仰靠在椅背上。至于目的地的坐标，婉达早已预先键入控制盘。“他是个自负感极强的人，我们唯一需要做的，只是夸大百科全书的正面影响，接下来他的自我便自行运作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He was a goner the minute Wanda and I walked in," Palver said from the back. "With both of us pushing him, it was a piece of cake." Palver reached forward and squeezed Wanda's shoulder affectionately. She smiled, reached up, and patted his hand </p><p>“婉达和我一走进去，他就成了囊中物。”坐在后座的帕佛说，“我们两人一起推他，简直就像探囊取物。”帕佛将手向前伸，深情地捏着婉达的肩膀。她则微微一笑，抬手轻拍他的手背。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I must alert the Encyclopedists as soon as possible," Seldon said. "Although there are only thirty-two left, they are good and dedicated workers. I'll get them installed at the Library and then I'll tackle the next hurdle-credits. Perhaps this alliance with the Library is what I need to convince people to give us funding. Let's see- I'll call upon Terep Bindris again and I'll take you two with me. He was kindly disposed toward me, at least at first. But how will he be able to resist us now?"</p><p>“我必须尽快知会百科全书编者。”谢顿说，“虽然只剩三十二位，但他们都是优秀且敬业的工作人员。我要赶紧把他们安置在帝国图书馆，然后还要处理另一个难题——信用点。说不定和帝国图书馆的这项合作，正好足以说服众人捐献经费。让我想想，我要再去拜访泰瑞普·宾缀斯，而且会带你俩一起去。他当初对我颇有好感，至少最初如此。可是现在，他有办法拒绝我们吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The ground-car eventually came to a halt outside the Psychohistory Building at Streeling. The side panels slid open, but Seldon did not immediately move to disembark. He turned to face Wanda </p><p>地面车终于在位于斯璀璘的心理史学大楼外停下来。车厢侧板随即滑开，但谢顿并没有立刻下车。他转过头来，面对着婉达。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda, you know what you and Stettin were able to accomplish with Acarnio; I'm sure you both can push some credits out of a few financial benefactors as well </p><p>“婉达，看看你和史铁亭在阿卡尼欧身上做到了什么。我确信你们两人联手，也能从几位慈善家身上挤出些信用点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know how you hate to leave your beloved Prime Radiant, but these visits will give you two a chance to practice, to hone your skills, to get an idea of just what you can do."</p><p>“我知道你多么不情愿离开你心爱的元光体，但这些造访能给你俩一个练习的机会，能磨炼你们的技巧，能让你们知道自己做得到什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"All right, Grandpa, although I'm sure that, now that you have the Library's imprimatur, you will find that resistance to your requests has lessened."</p><p>“好吧，爷爷，不过我很确定，既然你已获得帝国图书馆的批准，你将发觉你的要求不会再有多大阻力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There's another reason I think it's important for the two of you to get out and around together. -Stettin, I believe you said that on certain occasions you've `felt' another mind like yours but haven't been able to identify it."</p><p>“还有另一个原因，使我认为你们两人一起出去转转非常重要。史铁亭，我相信你说过，之前有几次，你曾经‘察觉’另一个像你这样的心灵，却没办法辨认出来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," answered Palver, "I've had flashes, but each time I was in a crowd. And, in my twenty-four years, I can remember feeling such a flash just four or five times."</p><p>“是的，”帕佛答道，“我曾经感到灵光，但每次我都在人群中。而且，二十四年来，我记得这种灵光只出现过四五次。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But, Stettin," said Seldon, his voice low with intensity, "each flash was, potentially, the mind of another person like you and Wanda-another mentalic. Wanda's never felt these flashes because, frankly, she's been sheltered all her life. The few times she's been out in a crowd there must not have been any other mentalics around.</p><p>“可是，史铁亭，”谢顿的声音低沉而炽烈，“理论上来说，每个灵光都代表另一个像你和婉达这样的人——另一个精神异人。婉达从未感到这种灵光，因为坦白讲，她这一生都关在象牙塔里。而她置身人群那少数几次，附近一定没有其他的精神异人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's one reason-perhaps the most important reason-for you two to get out-with me or without me. We must find other mentalics. The two of you alone are strong enough to push a single person. A large group of you, all pushing together, will have the power to move an Empire!"</p><p>“这也是你们两人该走出去的原因，或许还是最重要的一个原因——有没有我跟着都一样。我们必须找到其他的精神异人。光是你们两个，就强大到足以推动一个人；你们一大群人联手，大家一起推，将有摇撼一个帝国的力量！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With that. Hari Seldon swung his legs around and hoisted himself out of the ground-car. As Wanda and Palver watched him limp up the pathway to the Psychohistory Building, they were only dimly aware of the enormous responsibility Seldon had just placed on their young shoulders.</p><p>说到这里，哈里·谢顿将双腿旋转半圈，吃力地将自己推出地面车。当婉达与帕佛望着他跛着脚走向通往心理史学大楼的小径时，他们仅仅模糊地察觉到，谢顿刚在他们年轻的肩头搁下了千斤重担。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>33</p><p>33</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was midafternoon and the Trantorian sun glinted on the metal skin covering the great planet. Hari Seldon stood at the edge of the Streeling University observation deck, attempting to shield his eyes from the harsh glare with his hand. It had been years since he'd been out from under the dome, save for his few visits to the Palace, and somehow those didn't count; one was still very much enclosed on the Imperial grounds.</p><p>现在是下午三点左右，川陀的太阳反射在这颗伟大行星的金属表皮上。哈里·谢顿站在斯璀璘大学观景天台的边缘，抬起手遮住眼睛，试图遮蔽耀眼的强光。除了几次皇宫之行，他已有多年未曾出过穹顶。就某方面而言，皇宫之行不能算数，因为他仍旧深陷御苑的重围中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon no longer traveled around only if accompanied. In the first place, Palver spent the majority of his time with Wanda, either working on the Prime Radiant, absorbed in mentalic research, or searching for others like them. But if he had wanted, Seldon could have found another young man-a University student or a Project member-to act as his bodyguard.</p><p>谢顿不再一定得有伴才会到处走走。首要的原因，是帕佛大部分时间都和婉达在一起，或是钻研元光体，或是专注于精神力学的研究，否则就是出外寻找类似他们的人。但是谢顿倘若有意，仍然能找到其他年轻人——某个大学生或谢顿计划的成员，来充当他的保镖。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>However, Seldon knew that a bodyguard was no longer necessary. Since the much publicized hearing and the reestablishment of ties with the Galactic Library, the Commission for Public Safety had taken a keen interest in Seldon. Seldon knew that he was being followed; he had caught sight of his "shadow" on a number of occasions in the past few months. He also had no doubt that his home and office had been infiltrated by listening devices, but he himself activated a static shield whenever he engaged in sensitive communications.</p><p>然而，谢顿知道自己不再需要保镖。由于听证会轰动一时，以及他与帝国图书馆重新建立合作关系，使得公共安全委员会对谢顿产生强烈的关注。谢顿晓得时时有人跟踪他；过去几个月来，他好几次瞥见如影随形的跟踪者。他也绝不怀疑家里与研究室都藏有监听装置，不过每当进行敏感的通讯，他总会启动一个杂讯场。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was not sure what the Commission thought of him-perhaps they were not yet sure themselves. Regardless of whether they believed him to be a prophet or a crackpot, they made it their business to know where he was at all times-and that meant that, until the Commission deemed otherwise, at all times Seldon was safe.</p><p>谢顿不确定那个委员会对他的看法如何，或许他们自己也尚未确定。但无论他们是否相信他是先知或是狂人，他们已将随时掌握他的行踪当成分内工作。而这就意味着，在委员会改变态度之前，谢顿始终安全无虞。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A light breeze billowed the deep blue cloak Seldon had draped over his unisuit and ruffed the few wispy white hairs remaining on his head. He glanced down over the railing, taking in the seamless steel blanket below. Beneath that blanket, Seldon knew, rumbled the machinery of a vastly complicated world. If the dome were transparent, one would see ground-cars racing, gravicabs swooshing through an intricate network of interconnecting tunnels, space hyperships being loaded and unloaded with grain and chemicals and jewels bound for and from practically every world of the Empire.</p><p>一阵微风吹动谢顿罩在单件服上的深蓝色披风，并搅乱他头上所剩无几的稀疏白发。他透过栏杆向下望去，那张一望无际、毫无缝隙的钢毯尽收眼底。谢顿知道，在这张钢毯底下，一个极其复杂的世界正在隆隆运作。假使穹顶是透明的，他就能看到有地面车在疾驶，有重力计程车在繁复的隧道网络中风驰电掣，而来自或前往帝国各个世界的超空间飞船，则正在装卸着谷物、化学药品与珠宝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Below the gleaming metal cover, the lives of forty billion people were being conducted, with all the attendant pain, joy, and drama of human life. It was an image he loved dearly-this panorama of human achievement-and it pierced his heart to know that, in just a few centuries, all that now lay before him would be in ruins. The great dome would be ripped and scarred, torn away to reveal the desolate wasteland of what was once the seat of a thriving civilization. He shook his head in sadness, for he knew there was nothing he could do to prevent that tragedy. But, as Seldon foresaw the ruined dome, he also knew that from the ground laid bare by the last battles of the Empire living shoots would spring and somehow Trantor would reemerge as a vital member of the new Empire. The Plan saw to that.</p><p>在这个闪亮的金属罩子底下，四百亿人在此安居乐业，人生的喜怒哀乐、生老病死尽在其中。这个人类成就的缩影，是他深深喜爱的一幅图画。令他心如刀割的是，他知道不出几个世纪，如今展现眼前的一切便将成为废墟。这个伟大的穹顶将出现百孔千疮，甚至整个掀去，而下面将是一片荒凉。一个盛极一时的文明中枢，最后竟会落得如此下场。他悲伤地摇了摇头，因为他明白，他没有任何办法能阻止这个悲剧。可是，正如谢顿预见了残败的穹顶，他也同样了解，从这个被帝国最后几场战争摧毁殆尽的土地上，将会冒出新生的幼苗，而在一个崭新的帝国里，川陀终将再度成为重要的一员。谢顿计划早已安排好了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon lowered himself onto one of the benches ringing the deck's perimeter. His leg was throbbing painfully; the exertion of the trip had been a bit much. But it had been worth it to gaze once again at Trantor, to feel the open air around him and see the vast sky above.</p><p>天台周围环绕着一圈长椅，谢顿选了一张坐下来。这趟路程花的力气多了点，此时他的右腿疼痛地悸动着。但只要能再度凝望川陀，感受周遭露天的空气，并且看看头顶浩瀚的天空，受这点罪也是值得的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon thought wistfully of Wanda. He rarely saw his granddaughter at all anymore and invariably Stettin Palver was present when he did. In the three months since Wanda and Palver had met, they seemed to be inseparable. Wanda assured Seldon that the constant involvement was necessary for the Project, but Seldon suspected it went deeper than mere devotion to one's job.</p><p>谢顿万分思念地想起了婉达。现在他根本很少见到这个孙女，而有机会见到她时，史铁亭·帕佛则一律在场。自从婉达与帕佛相遇后，这三个月来，他们似乎形影不离。婉达向谢顿保证，两人的持续接触对谢顿计划是有必要的，但是谢顿觉得，他们所做的已超过对工作的投入。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He remembered the telltale signs from his early days with Dors. It was there in the way the two young people looked at each other, with an intensity born not only of intellectual stimulation but emotional motivation as well.</p><p>他忆起了自己与铎丝初遇之际，那些无法掩饰的迹象。比如说，两个年轻人互相凝望时，其热烈程度已不是知性的激励所能解释，而必须考虑到感性的动机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Further, by their very natures, Wanda and Palver seemed to be more comfortable with each other than with other people. In fact, Seldon had discovered that when no one else was around, Wanda and Palver didn't even talk to each other; their mentalic abilities were sufficiently advanced that they had no need of words to communicate.</p><p>此外，由于他们的异禀，婉达与帕佛带给彼此的自在感，似乎是其他人望尘莫及的。事实上，谢顿已经发现，没有他人在场的时候，婉达与帕佛甚至不再互相交谈；他们的精神能力已经足够进步，不需要再借着语言来沟通。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other Project members were not aware of Wanda's and Palver's unique talents. Seldon had felt it best to keep the mentalics' work quiet, at least until their role in the Plan was firmly defined. Actually the Plan itself was firmly defined-but solely in Seldon's mind. As a few more pieces fell into place, he would reveal his Plan to Wanda and Palver and someday, of necessity, to one or two others.</p><p>谢顿计划的其他成员尚未知晓婉达与帕佛的独特天赋。谢顿始终觉得最好让这些精神异人默默工作，至少，在他们的角色尚未获得坚实定位之前，不可以让他们曝光。实际上，这项‘子计划’本身已有坚实的定位，但仅仅在谢顿心中。等到再拼出一点轮廓之后，他会对婉达与帕佛透露这项子计划，而总有一天，出于必要，他还会告诉其他一两个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon stood slowly, stiffly. He was due back at Streeling in an hour to meet Wanda and Palver. They had left word for him that they were bringing a great surprise. Another piece for the puzzle, Seldon hoped. He looked out one last time over Trantor and, before turning to make his way back to the gravitic repulsion elevator, smiled and softly said, "Foundation."</p><p>谢顿缓缓地、僵硬地站起来。一小时后他得回到斯璀璘，和婉达与帕佛碰面。他们给他留了口信，说要带来一个大惊喜。谢顿希望，那会是这个拼图的另外一块。在转身走回反重力升降机前，他最后一次放眼望向川陀，微微一笑，轻轻说了一声：“基地。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>34</p><p>34</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon entered his office to find that Wanda and Palver had already arrived and were seated around the conference table at the far end of the room. As was usual with those two, the room was completely silent.</p><p>哈里·谢顿走进他的研究室，发现婉达与帕佛已经到了，正围坐在房间另一端的会议桌旁。正如两人通常独处时一样，室内完全寂静无声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then Seldon stopped short, noticing that a new fellow was sitting with them. How strange-out of politeness, Wanda and Palver usually reverted to standard speech when in the company of other people, yet none of the three was speaking.</p><p>然后，谢顿突然停下脚步，注意到还有一个陌生人和他们坐在一块。多奇怪啊——通常有他人在场之际，基于礼貌，婉达与帕佛会恢复正常的交谈，但这三个人却没有一个开口。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon studied the stranger-an odd-looking man, about thirty-five years old, with the myopic look of one caught up for too long in his studies. If it weren't for a certain determined set to the stranger's jaw, Seldon thought he might be dismissed as ineffectual, but that would obviously be a mistake. There was both strength and kindness in the man's face. A trustworthy face, Seldon decided.</p><p>谢顿打量着这个陌生人。他有一副古怪的外表，大约三十五岁，看起来像是用功过度而患了近视。若非他的下颚有几许坚毅的棱角，谢顿认为他很可能被人视为无能之辈，但那显然会是大错特错。此人脸上同时透出毅力与和气，谢顿判断那是一张值得信赖的脸孔。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandfather," Wanda said, rising gracefully from her chair. Seldon's heart ached as he looked at his granddaughter. She'd changed so much in the past few months, since the loss of her family. Whereas before she had always called him Grandpa, now it was the more formal Grandfather. In the past it seemed she could barely refrain from grins and giggles; lately her serene gaze was lightened only occasionally by a beatific smile. But-now as always-she was beautiful and that beauty was surpassed only by her stunning intellect.</p><p>“祖父。”婉达一面说，一面从椅子中盈盈起身。谢顿望着他的孙女，心头一阵刺痛。自从她失去家人，几个月以来，她改变了那么多。以前她总是叫他“爷爷”，如今则改成较正式的“祖父”。过去她似乎常常忍不住咧嘴笑或吃吃笑，最近则透着安详的目光，仅仅偶尔点缀一个喜气的笑容。可是，不变的是她仍旧美丽如昔，而也唯有她惊人的智力，才能令她的美貌相形见绌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda, Palver," Seldon said, kissing the former on the cheek and slapping the latter on the shoulder.</p><p>“婉达，帕佛。”谢顿说完，亲了一下前者的面颊，又拍了拍后者的肩膀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hello," Seldon said, turning to the stranger, who had also stood. "I am Hari Seldon."</p><p>“你好，”谢顿转向那位陌生人，对方早已站起来。“我是哈里·谢顿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am most honored to meet you, Professor," the man replied. "I am Bor Alurin." Alurin offered a hand to Seldon in the archaic and, hence, most formal mode of greeting.</p><p>“见到您是我莫大的荣幸，教授。”那人答道，“我叫玻尔·艾鲁云。”艾鲁云向谢顿伸出一只手，这是古老的、因而也是最正式的问候礼仪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Bor is a psychologist, Hari," said Palver, "and a great fan of your work."</p><p>“玻尔是一位心理学家，哈里，”帕佛说，“而且对你的工作极为着迷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"More important, Grandfather," said Wanda, "Bor is one of us."</p><p>“更重要的是，祖父，”婉达说，“玻尔是我们的一员。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"One of you?" Seldon looked searchingly from one to the other. "Do you mean……?" Seldon's eyes sparkled.</p><p>“你们的一员？”谢顿以探索的目光轮流望向他们三人，“你的意思是……？”谢顿的眼睛亮了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Grandfather. Yesterday Stettin and I were walking through Ery Sector, getting out and around, as you'd suggested, probing for others. All of a sudden-wham!-there it was."</p><p>“是的，祖父。昨天史铁亭和我走在艾瑞区，我们是照你的建议，出去转转，探访其他的同类。突然之间，轰！就出现了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We recognized the thought patterns immediately and began to look around, trying to establish a link," Palver said, taking up the story. "We were in a commercial area, near the spaceport, so the walkways were clogged with shoppers and tourists and Outworld traders. It seemed hopeless, but then Wanda simply stopped and signaled Come here and out of the crowd Bor appeared. He just walked up to us and signaled Yes?"</p><p>“我们立刻认出那个思想型样，开始四下寻找，试图建立联系。”帕佛把故事接下去，“我们当时在一个商业区，接近太空航站，所以人行道上挤满了购物者、观光客和外星行商。原本似乎毫无希望，但后来婉达干脆站住，发出‘来这里’的讯号，玻尔便从人群中出现了。他就这么向我们走来，并发出‘什么事？’的讯号。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Amazing," Seldon said, beaming at his granddaughter. "And Dr.-it is Doctor, isn't it?-Alurin, what do you make of all this?"</p><p>“不可思议。”谢顿对他的孙女露出微笑，“艾鲁云博士——是博士没错吧？你对这一切有什么看法？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well," began the psychologist thoughtfully, "I am pleased. I've always felt different somehow and now I know why. And if I can be of any help to you, why……" The psychologist looked down at his feet, as if all of a sudden he realized he was being presumptuous. "What I mean is, Wanda and Stettin said I may be able to contribute in some way to your Psychohistory Project. Professor, nothing would please me more."</p><p>“这个嘛，”这位心理学家若有所思地说，“我很高兴。我总感到自己有点不一样，现在我知道为什么了。假如我能对您有任何帮助，啊——”这位心理学家低下头来，仿佛突然察觉到太冒失了。“我的意思是，婉达和史铁亭都说，我也许能在某方面对您的心理史学计划作出贡献。教授，再也没有让我更高兴的事了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes yes. That's quite true, Dr. Alurin. In fact, I think you may make a great contribution to the Project-if you'll join me. Of course, you'll have to give up whatever it is you do now, whether it is teaching or private practice. Can you manage that?"</p><p>“是的，是的，相当正确，艾鲁云博士。事实上，你若是愿意加入我，我想你或许能对本计划作出极大的贡献。当然，不论你现在做些什么，你都必须放弃，不论是教书或行医。你做得到吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, yes, Professor, of course. I may need a little help convincing my wife……" At this he chuckled slightly, glancing shyly at each of his three companions in turn. "But I seem to have a way with that."</p><p>“啊，教授，当然可以。我也许需要点帮助，来说服我的妻子……”说到这里他轻笑了几声，又羞怯地轮流扫视在场其他三人。“但我似乎就是有办法做到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So it's set, then," said Seldon briskly. "You will join the Psychohistory Project. I promise you, Dr. Alurin, this is a decision you will not regret."</p><p>“那就这么说定了，”谢顿轻快地说，“你将加入心理史学计划。我向你保证，艾鲁云博士，这个决定不会令你后悔。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda, Stettin," Seldon said later, after Bor Alurin had left. "This is a most welcome breakthrough. How quickly do you think you can find more mentalics?"</p><p>“婉达，史铁亭，”玻尔·艾鲁云离去后，谢顿说，“这是个开心无比的突破。你们认为多快能找到更多的精神异人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandfather, it took us over a month to locate Bor-we cannot predict with what frequency others will be found.</p><p>“祖父，我们花了一个多月才发现玻尔，我们无法预测找到其他同类的频率。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To tell you the truth, all this `out and around' takes us away from our work on the Prime Radiant and it is distracting as well. Now that I have Stettin to `talk' to, verbal communication is somewhat too harsh, too loud. "</p><p>“告诉你一句实话，这个‘出去转转’的办法占用了我们研究元光体的时间，而且令我们分心。现在我既然有史铁亭可以‘交谈’，语言沟通就有些太刺耳、太吵闹了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon's smile faded. He had been afraid of this. As Wanda and Palver had been honing their mentalic skills, so their tolerance for "ordinary" life had diminished. It only made sense; their mentalic manipulations set them apart.</p><p>谢顿的笑容随即消失。他一直害怕这种事，婉达与帕佛将他们的精神力学技巧锻炼得越好，他们对“普通生活”的容忍度就越低。这很有道理，他们的精神异能使他们与众不同。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda, Stettin, I think it may be time for me to tell you more about the idea Yugo Amaryl had years ago and about the Plan I've devised as a result of that idea. I haven't been ready to elaborate upon it until now, because until this moment, all the pieces have not been in place.</p><p>“婉达，史铁亭，我想现在大概是时候了，我该进一步告诉你们雨果·阿马瑞尔多年前的构想，以及我根据这个构想而设想的子计划。直到今天，我才准备着手精心规划，因为直到此时此刻，一切才通通各就各位。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As you know, Yugo felt we must establish two Foundations-each as a fail-safe measure for the other. It was a brilliant idea, one which I wish Yugo could have lived long enough to see realized." Here Seldon paused, heaving a regretful sigh.</p><p>“你们已经知道，雨果当初觉得我们必须建立两个基地，互相作为后备。这是个杰出的构想，我多么希望雨果活得够长，能够亲眼见到它的实现。”在此谢顿暂时打住，遗憾地叹了一声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I digress. -Six years ago, when I was certain that Wanda had mentalic, or mind-touching, capabilities, it came to me that not only should there be two Foundations but that they should be distinct in nature, as well. One would be made up of physical scientists-the Encyclopedists will be their pioneer group on Terminus. The second would be made up of true psychohistorians; mentalists-you. That is why I've been so eager for you to find others like you.</p><p>“但我离题了。六年前，当我确定婉达具有精神异能，或说触动心灵的能力时，我就想到不但应该建立两个基地，而且两者应该具有相异的本质。其中之一由物理科学家组成——百科全书编者正是即将登陆端点星的先锋部队。另一个的成员则是真正的心理史学家——精神学家，也就是你们。所以我才这么急着要你们找到其他同类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Finally, though, is this: The Second Foundation must be secret. Its strength will lie in its seclusion, in its telepathic omnipresence and omnipotence.</p><p>“不过，最后我要强调的是：第二基地必须暗中进行。它的力量将根植于它的隐密，以及它无所不在、无所不能的精神感应力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You see, a few years ago, when it became apparent that I would require the services of a bodyguard, I realized that the Second Foundation must be the strong, silent, secret bodyguard of the primary Foundation.</p><p>“知道吗，几年前，当我显然需要找个保镖的时候，我就领悟到，第二基地必须作为第一基地的保镖，一个强大的、沉默的、秘密的保镖。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Psychohistory is not infallible-its predictions are, however, highly probable. The Foundation, especially in its infancy, will have many enemies, as do I today.</p><p>“心理史学并非绝对正确无误，然而，它的预测极有可能成真。第一基地，尤其是在它的襁褓期，将会有许多敌人，就像我今天这样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wanda, you and Palver are the pioneers of the Second Foundation, the guardians of the Terminus Foundation."</p><p>“婉达，你和帕佛则是第二基地的先锋，是端点星那个基地的守护者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But how, Grandfather?" demanded Wanda. "We are just two-well, three, if you count Bor. To guard the entire Foundation, we would need……"</p><p>“可是该怎么做呢，祖父？”婉达追问，“我们只有两个人——好吧，三个，如果你把玻尔也算在内。想要守护整个基地，我们将需要……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hundreds? Thousands? Find however many it takes, Granddaughter. You can do it. And you know how.</p><p>“几百人？几千人？需要多少就找多少，孙女。你做得到，你也知道该怎么做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Earlier, when relating the story of finding Dr. Alurin, Stettin said you simply stopped and communicated out to the mentalic presence you felt and he came to you. Don't you see? All along I've been urging you to go out and find others like you. But this is difficult, almost painful for you. I realize now that you and Stettin must seclude yourselves, in order to form the nucleus of the Second Foundation. From there you will cast your nets into the ocean of humanity."</p><p>“刚才，讲到如何发现艾鲁云博士的时候，史铁亭说你干脆站住，对你察觉的那股精神发出讯号，他就向你们走过来。你还不懂吗？在此之前，我一直驱策你们走出去，寻找其他像你们的人。但是对你们而言，这样做有困难，几乎是苦差事。现在我想通了，为了形成第二基地的核心，你和史铁亭必须离群而居。你们要从隐居处，再把无形的网撒向茫茫人海。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Grandfather, what are you saying?" Wanda asked in a whisper. She had left her seat and was kneeling next to Seldon's chair. "Do you want me to leave?"</p><p>“祖父，你在说些什么？”婉达悄声问道。此时她已离开座位，跪在谢顿的座椅旁。“你要我离开你吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, Wanda," Seldon replied, his voice choked with emotion. "I don't want you to leave, but it is the only way. You and Stettin must isolate yourselves from the crude physicality of Trantor. As your mentalic abilities grow stronger, you will attract others to you-the silent and secret Foundation will grow.</p><p>“不，婉达。”谢顿答道，声音中注满感情，“我不想要你离开，但这是唯一的办法，你与史铁亭必须和川陀的芸芸众生隔离开来。随着你们的精神力量逐渐增强，你们会慢慢吸引其他同类，于是沉默而秘密的基地便会形成。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We will be in touch-occasionally, of course. And each of us has a Prime Radiant. You see, don't you, the truth-and the absolute necessity -of what I am saying, don't you?"</p><p>“我们将保持联络，当然只是偶尔。而且，我们每个人都会有个元光体。你看得出我说的都是实情，而且有绝对的必要，是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I do, Grandfather," said Wanda. "More important, I feel the brilliance of it as well. Rest assured; we won't let you down."</p><p>“是的，我看得出来，祖父。”婉达说，“更重要的是，我感觉到了它的精妙。放心吧，我们不会让你失望。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know you won't, dear," Seldon said wearily.</p><p>“我知道你们不会，亲爱的。”谢顿疲倦地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How could he do this-how could he send his darling granddaughter away? She was his last link to his happiest days, to Dors, Yugo, and Raych. She was the only other Seldon in the Galaxy.</p><p>他怎能这样做，怎能把他心爱的孙女送走？她是他与一段最快乐的岁月，以及与铎丝、与雨果、与芮奇的最后一线联系。在整个银河中，她是谢顿家族硕果仅存的一员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I shall miss you terribly, Wanda," Seldon said as a tear worked its way down his finely creased cheek.</p><p>“我会万分想念你，婉达。”谢顿说着，一滴眼泪就落在满是细碎皱纹的脸颊上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But, Grandfather," Wanda said as she stood with Palver, preparing to leave. "Where shall we go? Where is the Second Foundation?"</p><p>“可是，祖父，”站在帕佛身边、准备离去的婉达说，“我们要到哪里去？第二基地到底在哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked up and said, "The Prime Radiant has already told you, Wanda."</p><p>谢顿抬起头来，说道：“元光体已经告诉你了，婉达。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda looked at Seldon blankly, searching her memory.</p><p>婉达茫然望向谢顿，同时搜寻着自己的记忆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon reached out and clutched at his granddaughter's hand.</p><p>谢顿伸出手去，抓住孙女的手。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Touch my mind, Wanda. It is there." </p><p>“接触我的心灵，婉达，它就在那里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wanda's eyes widened as she reached into Seldon's mind.</p><p>婉达进入谢顿的心灵之后，立刻张大眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I see," Wanda whispered to Seldon.</p><p>“我懂了。”婉达悄声对谢顿说。</p></div>
