<div class='layout'><p>Chapter 9 :Facing the Pack</p><p>第9章 面对野狗群</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>35</p><p>35</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Far Star came to rest at the bottom of a smallrise, a hill in the generally flat countryside. Almost without thought,Trevize had taken it for granted that it would be best for the ship notto be visible for miles in every direction.</p><p>远星号停在一个小山丘的山麓，山丘周围是一片平坦的开阔地。这是因为当初崔维兹几乎想也没想，就认为最好能降落在数英里范围内都没有曝光之虞的地方，因此这里是理所当然的最佳选择。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "The temperature outside is 24 C., the wind is about elevenkilometers per hour from the west, and it is partly cloudy. The computerdoes not know enough about the general air circulation to be able topredict the weather. However, since the humidity is some forty percent,it seems scarcely about to rain. On the whole, we seem to have chosen acomfortable latitude or season of the year, and after Comporellon that'sa pleasure."</p><p>他说：“外面温度是摄氏二十四度，多云，西风，风速大约每小时十一公里。电脑对大气循环模式知道得不够多，所以无法预测气候。不过，湿度差不多只有百分之四十，所以几乎不可能下雨。整体而言，我们似乎选了一个舒适的纬度，或者说选对了季节，去过康普隆之后，来到这里令人感到分外愉快。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I suppose," said Pelorat, "that as the planet continues tounterraform, the weather will become more extreme."</p><p>“我猜想，”裴洛拉特说，“如果这颗行星继续反改造下去，天气会变得更加极端。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm sure of that," said Bliss.</p><p>“我肯定这一点。”宝绮思说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Be as sure as you like," said Trevize. "We have thousands of yearsof leeway. Right now, it's still a pleasant planet and will continue tobe so for our lifetimes and far beyond."</p><p>“随便你怎样肯定，”崔维兹说，“我们还得等上几千几万年，才能知道正确答案。此时此刻，它仍是个宜人的行星，在我们有生之年，以及其后许久许久，它都会一直保持这样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was clasping a broad belt about his waist as he spoke, and Blisssaid sharply, "What's that, Trevize?"</p><p>他一面说话，一面在腰际扣上一条宽大的皮带。宝绮思尖声道：“那是什么，崔维兹？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Just my old navy training," said Trevize. "I'm not going into anunknown world unarmed."</p><p>“当初在舰队所受的训练，我还没忘记。”崔维兹说，“我不会赤手空拳闯进一个未知的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you seriously intending to carry weapons?"</p><p>“你当真要携带武器？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Absolutely. Here on my right" he slapped a holster thatcontained a massive weapon with a broad muzzle "is my blaster,and here on my left" a smaller weapon with a thin muzzle thatcontained no opening "is my neuronic whip."</p><p>“正是如此。在我的右侧，”他用力一拍右边的皮套，里面是个很有分量的大口径武器，“挂的是我的手铳，而左侧，”那是一柄较小的武器，口径很小而且没有开口，“是我的神经鞭。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Two varieties of murder," said Bliss, with distaste.</p><p>“两种杀人方式。”宝绮思以厌恶的口气说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Only one. The blaster kills. The neuronic whip doesn't. It juststimulates the pain nerves, and it hurts so that you can wish you weredead, I'm told. Fortunately, I've never been at the wrong end of one."</p><p>“只有一种，只有手铳能杀人。神经鞭却不会，只会刺激痛觉神经，不过我听说，它会令你痛不欲生。我很幸运，从未吃过这种苦头。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why are you taking them?"</p><p>“你为什么要带这些东西？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I told you. It's an enemy world."</p><p>“我告诉过你，这个世界可能有敌人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Trevize, it's an empty world."</p><p>“崔维兹，这个世界根本没有人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is it? There's no technological society, it would seem, but what ifthere are post-technological primitives. They may not possess anythingworse than clubs or rocks, but those can kill, too."</p><p>“是吗？它可能没有科技发达的人类社会，但是若有‘后科技时代’的原始人呢？他们或许顶多只有棍棒和石块，可是那些东西也能杀人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss looked exasperated, but lowered her voice in an effort to bereasonable. "I detect no human neuronic activity, Trevize. That eliminatesprimitives of any type, post-technological or otherwise."</p><p>宝绮思看来被激怒了，但她勉力压低声音，试图表现得足够理智。“我侦测不到人类的神经活动，崔维兹。这就剔除了各种原始人的可能性，不论是后科技时代还是其他时代的原始人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then I won't have to use my weapons," said Trevize. "Still, what harmwould there be in carrying them? They'll just make me a little heavier,and since the gravitational pull at the surface is about ninety-onepercent that of Terminus, I can afford the weight. Listen,the ship may be unarmed as a ship, but it has a reasonable supply ofhand-weapons. I suggest that you two also……"</p><p>“那我就没必要使用我的武器。”崔维兹说，“话说回来，带着它们又有什么害处呢？它们只会让我的重量增加少许，既然地表重力大约只有端点星的百分之九十一，我还承受得了这点重量。听我说，太空艇本身也许毫无武装，但装载了不少手提式武器，我建议你们两位也……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Bliss at once. "I will not make even a gesture in thedirection of killing or of inflicting pain, either."</p><p>“不要。”宝绮思立刻答道，“我不要作大开杀戒或散播痛苦的任何准备。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's not a question of killing, but of avoiding being killed, ifyou see what I mean."</p><p>“这不是大开杀戒，而是避免自己遭到杀害，希望你懂得我的意思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can protect myself in my own way."</p><p>“我能用自己的方法保护自己。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Janov?"</p><p>“詹诺夫？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat hesitated. "We didn't have arms on Comporellon."</p><p>裴洛拉特犹豫了一下。“在康普隆的时候，我们并未携带任何武器。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come, Janov, Comporellon was a known quantity, a world associatedwith the Foundation. Besides we were at once taken into custody. If we hadhad weapons, they would have been taken away. Do you want a blaster?"</p><p>“得了吧，詹诺夫。康普隆是个已知数，是个和基地结盟的世界。何况我们刚着陆便遭到逮捕，即使我们带了武器，也会马上被缴械。你到底要不要拿一柄手铳？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat shook his head. "I've never been in the Navy, old chap. Iwouldn't know how to use one of those things and, in an emergency, I wouldnever think of it in time. I'd just run and and get killed."</p><p>裴洛拉特摇了摇头。“我从未在舰队待过，老弟。我不知道怎样使用这些家伙，而且，遇到紧急情况，我绝对来不及想到开火。我只会向后跑，然后——然后就被杀掉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You won't get killed, Pel," said Bliss energetically. "Gaia has youin my/our/its protection, and that posturing naval hero as well."</p><p>“你不会被杀掉的，裴。”宝绮思中气十足地说，“盖娅将你置于我／们／它的保护之下，那个装腔作势的舰队英雄也一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "Good. I have no objection to being protected, but I amnot posturing. I am simply making assurance doubly sure, and if I neverhave to make a move toward these things, I'll be completely pleased,I promise you. Still I must have them."</p><p>崔维兹说：“很好，我不反对受到保护，但我可没有装腔作势，我只是要做到百分之两百的谨慎。如果我永远不必掏这些家伙，我会感到万分高兴，我向你保证。话说回来，我必须把它们带在身上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He patted both weapons affectionately and said, "Now let's step outon this world which may not have felt the weight of human beings uponits surface for thousands of years."</p><p>他珍爱地拍了拍那两件武器，又说：“现在让我们走向这个世界吧，它的地表可能有数千年未曾感受人类的重量了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>36</p><p>36</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have a feeling," said Pelorat, "that it must berather late in the day, but the sun is high enough to make it near noon,perhaps."</p><p>“我有一种感觉，”裴洛拉特说，“现在一定相当晚了，只是太阳还高高挂在天上，所以好像是近午时分。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I suspect," said Trevize, looking about the quiet panorama, "thatyour feeling originates out of the sun's orange tint, which gives it asunset feel. If we're still here at actual sunset and the cloud formationsare proper, we ought to experience a deeper red than we're used to. Idon't know whether you'll find it beautiful or depressing. Forthat matter it was probably even more extreme on Comporellon, but therewe were indoors virtually all the time."</p><p>“我猜想，”崔维兹一面浏览静谧的景观，一面说，“你的感觉源自这个太阳的橙色色调，它带来一种日落的感觉。当真正的日落来临时，假如我们仍在此地，而云层结构又正常的话，我们应该会发现夕阳比平常所见的更红。我不知道你会感到美丽还是阴郁。这种差异在康普隆也许更极端，不过我们在那里的时候，从头到尾都待在室内。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He turned slowly, considering the surroundings in all directions. Inaddition to the almost subliminal oddness of the light, there was thedistinctive smell of the world or this section of it. It seemeda little musty, but far from actively unpleasant.</p><p>他缓缓转身，检视着四周的环境。除了光线令人几乎下意识地感到奇怪，这个世界——或是这个地区——还有一种特殊的气味。似乎带有一点霉味，但绝不至于令人恶心。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The trees nearby were of middling height, and looked old, with gnarledbark and trunks a little off the vertical, though because of a prevailingwind or something off-color about the soil he couldn't tell. Was itthe trees that lent a somehow menacing ambience to the world or was itsomething else less material?</p><p>附近的树木不高不矮，看来全是些老树，树皮上长了不少树瘤。树干都不算很直，不过他无从判断究竟是因为强风，或是由于土质不佳。是否就是这些树木，为这个世界平添了某种威胁感，抑或是其他什么东西——更无形的东西？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss said, "What do you intend to do, Trevize? Surely we didn't comeall this distance to enjoy the view?"</p><p>宝绮思说：“你打算做些什么，崔维兹？我们大老远来到此地，当然不是来欣赏风景的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "Actually, perhaps that ought to be my part of it justnow. I would suggest that Janov explore this place. There are ruinsoff in that direction and he's the one who can judge the value of anyrecords he might find. I imagine he can understand writings or films inarchaic Galactic and I know quite well I wouldn't. And I suppose, Bliss,you want to go with him in order to protect him. As for me, I will stayhere as a guard on the outer rim."</p><p>崔维兹说：“其实，我现在该做的也许就是欣赏风景。我想建议詹诺夫探查一下这个地方，那个方向有些废墟，如果发现任何记录，只有他才能判断有没有价值。我猜他看得懂古银河文的手稿或影片，而我很清楚自己没办法。而且我认为，宝绮思，你想跟他一起去，以便就近保护他。至于我自己，我会留在这里，在废墟外围为你们站岗。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A guard against what? Primitives with rocks and clubs?"</p><p>“为什么要站岗？防备拿着棍棒和石块的原始人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps." And then the smile that had hovered about his lips fadedand he said, "Oddly enough, Bliss, I'm a little uneasy about this place. I can't say why."</p><p>“也许吧。”他挂在嘴角的微笑突然敛去，又说：“真奇怪，宝绮思，我觉得这个地方有点不对劲，我也说不上来为什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat said, "Come, Bliss. I've been a home-body collector ofold tales all my life, so I've never actually put my hands on ancientdocuments. Just imagine if we could find……"</p><p>裴洛拉特说：“来吧，宝绮思，我这辈子一直蹲在家里搜集古代传说，从未真正摸过古老的文件。想想看，如果我们能发现……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize watched them walk away, Pelorat's voice fading as he walkedeagerly toward the ruins; Bliss swinging along at his side.</p><p>崔维兹目送着他们两人。裴洛拉特急切地朝废墟走去，声音渐行渐远，宝绮思则轻快地走在他旁边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize listened absently and then turned back to continue his studyof the surroundings. What could there be to rouse apprehension?</p><p>崔维兹心不在焉地听了一会儿，然后转过身来，继续研究周遭的环境。究竟是什么引起他的忧虑呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had never actually set foot upon a world without a human population,but he had viewed many from space. Usually, they were small worlds, notlarge enough to hold either water or air, but they had been useful asmarking a meeting site during naval maneuvers (there had been no war inhis lifetime, or for a century before his birth but maneuvers went on),or as an exercise in simulated emergency repairs. Ships he had been onhad been in orbit about such worlds, or had even rested on them, but hehad never had occasion to step off the ships at those times.</p><p>他从未真正涉足任何毫无人迹的世界，倒是从太空中观察过许多个。它们通常都是小型世界，小得无法留住水分与空气，不过它们还是有些用处，例如在舰队演习时，用来标示一个会师点（在他一生中，以及他出生前整整一个世纪内，一直没有战争发生，但军事演习从未中断过），或是作为紧急修护模拟的训练场地。他当初服役的那些船舰，曾多次进入这种世界的轨道，有时也会降落其上，可是他从来没机会走到外面去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was it that he was now actually standing on an empty world? Would hehave felt the same if he had been standing on one of the many small,airless worlds he had encountered in his student days and evensince?</p><p>这种感觉，是不是由于他现在真正立足于一个无人世界？假使在服役那段日子里，他曾踏上某个没有空气的小型世界，是否也会有同样的感觉？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He shook his head. It wouldn't have bothered him. He was sure ofthat. He would have been in a space suit, as he had been innumerabletimes when he was free of his ship in space. It was a familiar situationand contact with a mere lump of rock would have produced no alterationin the familiarity. Surely!</p><p>他摇了摇头，那并不会对他造成任何困扰，他相当肯定。他会穿上太空衣走出去，如同他做过无数次的太空漫步一样。那是一种熟悉的情况，而仅仅与一大块“岩石”接触，并不会改变这种熟悉的感觉。绝对不会！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Of course He was not wearing a space suit now.</p><p>当然，这次他并没有穿太空衣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was standing on a habitable world, as comfortable to the feel asTerminus would be far more comfortable than Comporellon had been. Heexperienced the wind against his cheek, the warmth of the sun on his back,the rustle of vegetation in his ears. Everything was familiar, exceptthat there were no human beings on it at least, not any longer.</p><p>他正站在一个适宜住人的世界上，感觉就像在端点星一样舒服——比康普隆舒服得多。他感到微风拂过面颊，温暖的阳光照在背上，植物摩擦的沙沙声传入耳中。每样东西都那么熟悉，除了没有人类——至少，人类如今已不复存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was that it? Was it that that made the world seem so eerie? Was itthat it was not merely an uninhabited world, but a deserted one?</p><p>是不是这个原因？是不是因为这样，才使这个世界显得阴森森的？是否因为它不仅是个无人的世界，更是个遭到废弃的世界？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had never been on a deserted world before; never heard of a desertedworld before; never thought a world could be deserted. Allthe worlds he had known of till now, once they had been populated byhuman beings, remained so populated forever.</p><p>他以前从未到过任何废弃的世界，也没听说过有什么废弃的世界，甚至根本没想到过有哪个世界会遭到废弃。直到目前为止，他所知道的每一个世界，人类一旦移民其上，子子孙孙就会永远住下去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked up toward the sky. Nothing else had deserted it. Anoccasional bird flew across his line of vision, seeming more natural,somehow, than the slate-blue sky between the orange-tinted fair-weatherclouds. (Trevize was certain that, given a few days on the planet, hewould become accustomed to the off-color so that sky and clouds wouldgrow to seem normal to him.)</p><p>他抬头望向天空，其他生物都没有遗弃这个世界。有只鸟儿刚好飞过他的视线，似乎比橙色云朵间的青灰色天空更为自然。（崔维兹十分肯定，只要在这颗行星上多住几天，他就会习惯这些奇异的色调，到那个时候，天空与云朵也会显得正常了。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He heard birdsongs from the trees, and the softer noise ofinsects. Bliss had mentioned butterflies earlier and here theywere in surprising numbers and in several colorful varieties.</p><p>他听到树上有鸟儿在歌唱，还有昆虫在轻声呢喃。宝绮思早先提到的蝴蝶，现在他果然看见了——数量多得惊人，而且有好几种不同花色。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were also occasional rustlings in the clumps of grass thatsurrounded the trees, but he could not quite make out what was causingthem.</p><p>树旁草丛中也不时传来沙沙声，但他无法确定是什么东西引起的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nor did the obvious presence of life in his vicinity rouse fear inhim. As Bliss had said, terraformed worlds had, from the very first,lacked dangerous animals. The fairy tales of childhood, and the heroicfantasies of his teenage years were invariably set on a legendary worldthat must have been derived from the vague myths of Earth. The hyperdramaholoscreen had been filled with monsters lions, unicorns, dragons,whales, brontosaurs, bears. There were dozens of them with names hecould not remember; some of them surely mythical, and perhaps all ofthem. There were smaller animals that bit and stung, even plants thatwere fearful to the touch but only in fiction. He had once heardthat primitive honeybees were able to sting, but certainly no red beeswere in any way harmful.</p><p>令他感到心神不宁的，并非附近这些放眼可见的生命。正如宝绮思所说，人类对一个世界进行改造时，一开始就不会引进危险的动物。他幼年读的童话，以及少年时期看的奇幻故事，一律发生在一个传说中的世界（那一定脱胎于含糊的地球神话）。在超波戏剧的全息屏幕中，则充满各式各样的怪兽——狮子、独角兽、巨龙、鲸类、雷龙、狗熊等等，总共有几十种，大多数的名字他都不记得了。其中有些当然是神话的产物，或许通通都是也说不定。此外，还有些会咬人或螫人的小动物，甚至某些植物都是碰不得的，不过仅限于虚构故事中。他也曾听说原始蜜蜂会螫人，但真实世界的蜜蜂绝对不会伤害人类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Slowly, he walked to the right, skirting the border of the hill. Thegrass was tall and rank, but sparse, growing in clumps. He made his wayamong the trees, also growing in clumps.</p><p>他慢慢向右方走去，绕过山丘的边缘。那里的草丛又高又密，但一丛丛分布得很零散。他走在树林间，其中的树木也是一丛丛地生长。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then he yawned. Certainly, nothing exciting was happening, andhe wondered if he might not retreat to the ship and take a nap. No,unthinkable. Clearly, he had to stand on guard.</p><p>他打了个呵欠。不用说，并没有发生任何刺激的状况，他不知道该不该回太空艇打个盹。不，绝不能有那种念头，他现在显然得好好站岗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Perhaps he ought to do sentry duty-marching, one, two, one two,swinging about with a snap and performing complicated maneuverings witha parade electro-rod. (It was a weapon no warrior had used in threecenturies, but it was still absolutely essential at drill, for no reasonanyone could ever advance.)</p><p>也许他该演习一下步哨勤务。齐步走，一、二、一、二，来个迅速的转身，手中拿着一支阅兵用的电棒，操演着复杂的花式动作。（战士已有三世纪未曾使用这种武器，但在训练的时候，它却是绝对必要的项目，没有人说得出这是什么道理。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He grinned at the thought of it, then wondered if he ought to joinPelorat and Bliss in the ruins. Why? What good would he do?</p><p>这种突如其来的想法不禁令他笑了笑，然后他又想到，自己是不是该走到废墟，加入裴洛拉特与宝绮思的行列。为什么呢？他帮得上什么忙吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suppose he saw something that Pelorat had happened tooverlook? Well, time enough to make the attempt after Peloratreturned. If there was anything that might be found easily, by all meanslet Pelorat make the discovery.</p><p>或许他能看到裴洛拉特刚好忽略的某样东西？嗯，等裴洛拉特回来后，还有的是时间那样做。如果有什么不难发现的东西，一定要留给裴洛拉特才对。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Might the two be in trouble? Foolish! What possible kind oftrouble?</p><p>他们两人可能遇到麻烦吗？真傻！能有什么样的麻烦？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And if there were trouble, they would call out.</p><p>万一出了什么问题，他们一定会呼救。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He stopped to listen. He heard nothing.</p><p>他开始仔细倾听，结果什么都没听到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then the irresistible thought of sentry duty recurred to himand he found himself marching, feet moving up and down with a stamp,an imaginary electro-rod coming off one shoulder, whirling, and beingheld out straight before him, exactly vertical-whirling again, end overend, and back over the other shoulder. Then, with a smart about-face,he was looking toward the ship (rather far-off now) once more.</p><p>然后，步哨勤务的念头又在他心中浮现，挥也挥不去。他发现自己开始齐步走，双脚此起彼落，踏出有力的节奏。一支想象中的电棒从肩头甩出去，打了几个转，然后被他笔直地举在正前方；接着电棒又开始打转，再回到另一侧的肩头。而在一个利落的向后转之后，他再度面对着太空艇（不过现在距离相当远了）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And when he did that, he froze in reality, and not in sentrymake-believe.</p><p>向前望去的时候，他突然从角色扮演回到了现实，僵立在原地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was not alone.</p><p>这里不只他一个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Until then, he had not seen any living creature other than plantgrowth, insects, and an occasional bird. He had neither seen nor heardanything approach but now an animal stood between him and theship.</p><p>在此之前，除了植物、昆虫，以及一只小鸟，他没看到任何其他生物。他也未曾见到或听到有任何东西接近——现在却有一头动物站在他与太空艇之间。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sheer surprise at the unexpected event deprived him, for a moment, ofthe ability to interpret what he saw. It was not till after a perceptibleinterval that he knew what he was looking at.</p><p>这个意料之外的状况令他吓呆了，一时之间，他丧失了解释视觉讯号的能力。过了相当长的时间，他才明白自己正在望着什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was only a dog.</p><p>那只不过是一只狗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize was not a dog person. He had never owned a dog and hefelt no surge of friendliness toward one when he encountered it. Hefelt no such surge this time, either. He thought, rather impatiently,that there was no world on which these creatures had not accompaniedmen. They existed in countless varieties and Trevize had long had theweary impression that each world had at least one variety characteristicof itself. Nevertheless, all varieties were constant in this: whether theywere kept for entertainment, show, or some form of useful work theywere bred to love and trust human beings.</p><p>崔维兹不算是爱狗人士，他从未养过狗，碰到狗的时候也不会有什么特别的亲切感，当然这次也不例外。他不耐烦地想，无论在哪个世界上，都一定会有这种动物伴着人类。它们的品种数也数不尽，而崔维兹一直有个烦厌的印象，每个世界至少有一种特有的品种。然而，所有的品种都有一个共同点：不论它们是养来消遣、表演，或是做其他有用的工作，都被教得对人类充满敬爱与信任。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a love and trust Trevize had never appreciated. He had oncelived with a woman who had had a dog. That dog, whom Trevize toleratedfor the sake of the woman, conceived a deep-seated adoration for him,followed him about, leaned against him when relaxing (all fifty poundsof him), covered him with saliva and hair at unexpected moments, andsquatted outside the door and moaned whenever he and the woman weretrying to engage in sex.</p><p>崔维兹向来无法消受这种敬爱与信任。他曾跟某位养了一只狗的女子同居一段时间，看在女主人的份上，崔维兹对那只狗百般容忍，它却对他产生了根深蒂固的爱慕之情，总是跟着他到处跑，休息的时候则依偎他身旁（五十磅的体重全靠过来），出其不意就会让他身上沾满唾液与狗毛。每当他和女主人想要享受性爱，它就会蹲在门外不断呻吟。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From that experience, Trevize had emerged with the firm convictionthat for some reason known only to the canine mind and its odor-analyzingability, he was a fixed object of doggish devotion.</p><p>从那段经验中，崔维兹建立了一项坚定的信念：自己是狗儿们一贯挚爱的对象。至于原因为何，只有犬科的心灵与它们分辨气味的能力能够解释。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Therefore, once the initial surprise was over, he surveyed thedog without concern. It was a large dog, lean and rangy, and with longlegs. It was staring at him with no obvious sign of adoration. Its mouthwas open in what might have been taken as a welcoming grin, but theteeth displayed were somehow large and dangerous, and Trevize decidedthat he would be more comfortable without the dog in his line of view.</p><p>因此，一旦从最初的惊讶中恢复，他开始放心地打量这只狗。它体型很大，身形瘦削，四肢细长。它正在瞪着他，却看不出有什么爱慕之情。它的嘴巴张着，也许可以解释为欢迎的笑容，但绽现的牙齿却又大又锋利。崔维兹相信，如果这只狗不在视线内，自己想必会觉得自在些。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It occurred to him, then, that the dog had never seen a human being,and that countless canine generations preceding had never seen one. Thedog might have been as astonished and uncertain at the sudden appearanceof a human being as Trevize had been at that of the dog. Trevize, atleast, had quickly recognized the dog for what it was, but the dog didnot have that advantage. It was still puzzled, and perhaps alarmed.</p><p>突然间他又想到，这只狗从未见过人类，它的祖先也一定有无数代不知人类为何物。现在面前忽然出现一个人，它也许跟崔维兹看到它的反应一样，感到相当惊讶而不安。崔维兹至少很快就认出它是一只狗，那只狗却没有这个优势。它仍然不知如何是好，可能已经提高了警觉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Clearly, it would not be safe to leave an animal that large, andwith such teeth, in an alarmed state. Trevize realized that it would benecessary to establish a friendship at once.</p><p>让一只体型那么庞大、牙齿如此锋利的动物一直处于警戒状态，显然不是一件安全的事。崔维兹心里很明白，双方需要赶紧建立友谊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Very slowly, he approached the dog (no sudden motions, of course). Heheld out his hand, ready to allow it to be sniffed, and made soft,soothing sounds, most of which consisted of "Nice doggy" somethinghe found intensely embarrassing.</p><p>他以非常缓慢的动作，向那只狗慢慢接近（当然不能有突兀的行动）。然后他伸出一只手，准备让它来嗅一嗅，同时发出轻柔的、具有安抚作用的声音，还不时夹杂着“乖乖狗儿”这类的话，令他自己都感到十分难为情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The dog, eyes fixed on Trevize, backed away a step or two, as thoughin distrust, and then its upper lip wrinkled into a snarl and from itsmouth there issued a rasping growl. Although Trevize had never seen a dogbehave so, there was no way of interpreting the action as representinganything but menace.</p><p>那只狗双眼紧盯着崔维兹，向后退了一两步，仿佛并不信任对方。然后它掀起上唇，龇牙咧嘴，口中还发出一声刺耳的吠叫。虽然崔维兹从未见过任何狗儿有这种表现，可是除了威吓，这些动作根本不能作别的解释。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize therefore stopped advancing and froze. His eyes caughtmotion to one side, and his head turned slowly. There were two otherdogs advancing from that direction. They looked just as deadly as thefirst.</p><p>因此崔维兹停止前进，僵立在原处。此时，他从眼角瞥见旁边有东西在动，于是慢慢转过头去，竟然发现又有两只狗从那个方向走来，看起来跟原先那只一样要命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Deadly? That adjective occurred to him only now, and its dreadfulappropriateness was unmistakable.</p><p>——要命？他现在才想到这个形容词，却是贴切得可怕，这点绝对错不了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His heart was suddenly pounding. The way to the ship was blocked. Hecould not run aimlessly, for those long canine legs would reach him inyards. If he stood his ground and used his blaster, then while he killedone, the other two would be upon him. Off in the distance, he could seeother dogs approaching. Was there some way in which they communicated? Didthey hunt in packs?</p><p>他的心脏突然怦怦乱跳。回太空艇的路被堵住了，他却不能漫无目的地乱跑，因为那些长腿狗儿在几码内就会追上他。但他若是站在原地，用手铳对付它们，那么刚杀死一只，另外两只便会扑向他。而在较远的地方，他可以看到有更多的狗向这里走来。难道它们彼此有什么办法联络？它们总是成群出猎吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Slowly, he shifted ground leftward, in a direction in which therewere no dogs as yet. Slowly.........</p><p>他慢慢向左侧移动，那个方向没有任何狗——目前还没有。慢慢地，慢慢地移动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The dogs shifted ground with him. He felt certain that all that savedhim from instant attack was the fact that the dogs had never seen orsmelled anything like himself before. They had no established behaviorpattern they could follow in his case.</p><p>那三只狗跟着他一起移动。他心里有数，自己之所以没有受到立即攻击，是因为这些狗从未见过或闻过像他这样的东西。对于他这个猎物，它们尚未建立起可供遵循的行为模式。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If he ran, of course, that would represent something familiar to thedogs. They would know what to do if something the size of Trevize showedfear and ran. They would run, too. Faster.</p><p>假如他拔腿飞奔，这个动作当然会让它们感到熟悉。碰到类似崔维兹这般大小的猎物因恐惧而逃跑，这些狗知道该如何行动。它们会跟着跑，而且跑得更快。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize kept sidling toward a tree. He had the wildest desire to moveupward where the dogs could not follow. They moved with him, snarlingsoftly, coming closer. All three had their eyes fixed unwinkingly uponhim. Two more were joining them and, farther off, Trevize could seestill other dogs approaching. At some point, when he was close enough,he would have to make the dash. He could not wait too long, or run toosoon. Either might be fatal.</p><p>崔维兹继续侧着身，朝一株树木移动。他实在太想爬到树上，这样至少能暂时摆脱它们。它们却跟着他一起移动脚步，轻声咆哮着，而且愈走愈近，三只狗的眼睛都眨也不眨地盯着他。此时又多了两只狗加入它们的行列，而在更远的地方，崔维兹还能看到有更多的狗走过来。当他跟那棵树接近到某个程度时，他就必须开始冲刺。他不能等待太久，也不能起跑太早，这两种行动都会令他丧命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now!</p><p>就是现在！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He probably set a personal record for acceleration and even so it wasa near thing. He felt the snap of jaws close on the heel of one foot,and for just moment he was held fast before the teeth slid off thetough ceramoid.</p><p>他可能打破了自己瞬间加速的纪录，即使如此，却仍是千钧一发。他感到一只脚的后跟被狗嘴猛然咬住，一时之间动弹不得，直到坚固的陶质鞋面滑脱尖锐的狗牙，他才将腿抽了回来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was not skilled at climbing trees. He had not climbed one since hewas ten and, as he recalled, that had been a clumsy effort. In this case,though, the trunk was not quite vertical, and the bark was gnarled andoffered handholds. What was more, he was driven by necessity, and it isremarkable what one can do if the need is great enough.</p><p>他不擅长爬树，十岁之后就没再爬过，而且他还记得，小时候爬树的技巧相当拙劣。不过这回情况还算好，树干并不太垂直，树皮上又有许多节瘤可供攀抓。更何况现在情非得已，在不得已的情况下，一个人能做出许多惊人的事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize found himself sitting in a crotch, perhaps ten meters aboveground. For the moment he was totally unaware that he had scraped handand that it was oozing blood. At the base of the tree, five dogs now ontheir haunches, staring upward, tongues lolling, all looking patientlyexpectant.</p><p>崔维兹终于坐在一个树枝分岔处，离地大概有十米。他一只手刮破了，正渗出血来，但一时之间他完全没有察觉。在树底下，有五只狗蹲坐在那里，每只都抬头盯着树上，还吐出了舌头，看来全都在耐心期待。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What now?</p><p>现在该怎么办？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>37</p><p>37</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize was not in a position to think about thesituation in logical detail. Rather, he experienced flashes of thought inodd and distorted sequence which, if he had eventually sorted them out,would have come to this……</p><p>崔维兹无法有条不紊地思考目前的处境，他的思绪成了许多一闪即逝的片段，顺序古怪而扭曲。如果事后他能厘清思路，大致应该是这个样子——</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss had earlier maintained that in terraforming a planet, humanbeings would establish an unbalanced economy, which they would be able tokeep from falling apart only by unending effort. For instance, no Settlershad brought with them any of the large predators. Small ones could not behelped. Insects, parasites even small hawks, shrews, and so on.</p><p>宝绮思先前曾极力主张，人类将一颗行星改造之后，注定会建立一个非平衡的自然界，唯有借着不断的努力，才有可能勉强维系。比如说，银河殖民者从来不带大型猎食动物随行，小型的则无可避免，例如昆虫或寄生物，甚至小型的鹰隼和尖鼠等等。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Those dramatic animals of legend and vague literaryaccounts tigers, grizzly bears, orcs, crocodiles? Who would carrythem from world to world even if there were sense to it? And where wouldthere be sense to it?</p><p>至于在传说中，以及含意模糊的文学作品里出现的猛兽，老虎、灰熊、海怪、鳄鱼，谁会将它们从一个世界带到另一个世界——即使那样做真有意义？而又会有什么意义呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It meant that human beings were the only large predators, and it wasup to them to cull those plants and animals that, left to themselves,would smother in their own overplenty.</p><p>这意味着人类是唯一的大型猎食动物，可以随心所欲摄取各种动物与植物。若是没有人类介入，那些动植物将会由于繁衍过剩，导致生存受到威胁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And if human beings somehow vanished, then other predators must taketheir place. But what predators? The most sizable predators toleratedby human beings were dogs and cats, tamed and living on human bounty.</p><p>假如人类由于某种原因而消失，其他猎食动物必将取而代之。会是哪种猎食动物呢？人类能够容忍的最大猎食动物是猫和狗，它们早已被人类驯服，生活在人类的荫庇下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What if no human beings remained to feed them? They must thenfind their own food for their survival and, in all truth, forthe survival of those they preyed on, whose numbers had to be kept incheck lest overpopulation do a hundred times the damage that predationswould do.</p><p>万一不再有人饲养它们呢？那时它们必须自己寻找食物才能活下去，而且事实上，那些猎物也因此得以存活。后者的数量必须维持一个定值，否则过度繁殖所带来的灾害，将百倍于遭到猎捕的损失。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So dogs would multiply, in their variations, with the large onesattacking the large, untended herbivores; the smaller ones preying onbirds and rodents. Cats would prey by night as dogs did by day; theformer singly, the latter in packs.</p><p>因此狗类会继续增殖，各类品种应有尽有，其中大型狗只会攻击大型的、无人照料的草食动物，小型的则会猎捕鸟类与啮齿类。猫在夜间捕食，狗在白昼行动；前者单打独斗，后者则成群结队。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And perhaps evolution would eventually produce more varieties, tofill additional environmental niches. Would some dogs eventually developsea-going characteristics to enable them to live on fish; and would somecats develop gliding abilities to hunt the clumsier birds in the air aswell as on the ground?</p><p>或许通过演化，最后会产生更多不同的品种，来填补生态席位多余的空缺。会不会有些狗类最后发展出水中活动的本领，而能靠鱼类维生？而有些猫类则发展出滑翔能力，得以攫获空中与地表那些行动笨拙的鸟类？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In flashes, all this came to Trevize while he struggled with moresystematic thought to tell him what he might do.</p><p>正当崔维兹绞尽脑汁，想要有条理地考虑一下该如何行动时，这些意识的片段却一股脑涌现出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The number of dogs kept growing. He counted twenty-three nowsurrounding the tree and there were others approaching. How large wasthe pack? What did it matter? It was large enough already.</p><p>此时野狗的数目不断增加，他数了一下，现在总共有二十三只围绕着这棵树，此外还有好些在渐渐迫近。这群野狗的数量究竟有多少？那又有什么关系？现在已经够多了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He withdrew his blaster from its holster, but the solid feel of thebutt in his hand did not give him the sense of security he would haveliked. When had he last inserted an energy unit into it and how manycharges could he fire? Surely not twenty-three.</p><p>他从皮套中掏出手铳，可是手中握着坚实铳柄的感觉，并未给他带来希望中的安全感。他上次填充能量丸是什么时候？他总共能发射几次？当然不到二十三次。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What about Pelorat and Bliss? If they emerged, would the dogs turnon them? Were they safe even if they did not emerge? If the dogs sensedthe presence of two human beings inside the ruins, what could stop themfrom attacking them there? Surely there would be no doors or barriersto hold them off.</p><p>裴洛拉特与宝绮思又该怎么办呢？如果他们出现，那些野狗会不会转而攻击他们？即使他们不现身，难道就一定安然无事吗？假使狗群嗅到废墟中还有两个人，有什么能阻止它们跑到那里去攻击他们？绝对没有什么门或栏杆可供阻挡一阵。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Could Bliss stop them, and even drive them away? Could she concentrateher powers through hyperspace to the desired pitch of intensity? Forhow long could she maintain them?</p><p>宝绮思能不能抵御它们的进攻，甚至将它们驱走？她能否将超空间那头的力量集中，提升到需要的强度？她又能维持那些力量多久？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Should he call for help then? Would they come running if he yelled,and would the dogs flee under Bliss's glare? (Would it take a glare orwas it simply a mental action undetectable to onlookers without theability?) Or, if they appeared, would they then be torn apart underthe eyes of Trevize, who would be forced to watch, helplessly, from therelative safety of his post in the tree?</p><p>那么，他应不应该呼救？如果他高声喊叫，他们会不会立刻跑过来？而在宝绮思瞪视之下，那些野狗会不会四下逃窜？（真需要瞪视吗？或者只是一种精神活动，不具那种能力的旁观者根本无法侦知？）或者，他们若是出现，会不会在他面前被撕成碎片，而他只能相当安全地高坐树上，眼睁睁看着这幕惨剧，一点办法也没有？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No, he would have to use his blaster. If he could kill one dog andfrighten them off for just a while, he could scramble down the tree,yell for Pelorat and Bliss, kill a second dog if they showed signs ofreturning, and all three could then hustle into the ship.</p><p>不，他一定得使用手铳。只要他能杀死一只，把其他的野狗暂时吓退，他就可以爬下树来，呼叫裴洛拉特与宝绮思。假如那些野狗显出折返的意图，他会再杀一只，然后他们三人便能冲进太空艇中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He adjusted the intensity of the microwave beam to the three-quartermark. That should be ample to kill a dog with a loud report. The reportwould serve to frighten the dogs away, and he would be conservingenergy.</p><p>他将微波束的强度调到四分之三，那足以令一只野狗毙命，同时带来巨大的响声。巨响可将其他野狗吓跑，这样就能替他节省一些能量。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He aimed carefully at a dog in the middle of the pack, one who seemed(in Trevize's own imagination, at least) to exude a greater malignancythan the rest perhaps only because he sat more quietly and,therefore, seemed more cold-bloodedly intent on his prey. The dog wasstaring directly at the weapon now, as though it scorned the worstTrevize could do.</p><p>他仔细瞄准狗群中央的某一只，它似乎（至少，在崔维兹自己的想象中）比其他狗散发出更浓的敌意。或许只是因为它显得特别安静，因而好像对它的猎物有更残酷的企图。现在，那只狗直直盯着他手中的武器，仿佛表示崔维兹的手段再凶，它也不放在眼里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It occurred to Trevize that he had never himself fired a blasterat a human being, or seen anyone else do it. There had been firing atwater-filled dummies of leather and plastic during training; with thewater almost instantaneously heated to the boiling point, and shreddingthe covering as it exploded.</p><p>崔维兹突然想到，自己从未对任何人动用过手铳，也从来没有目睹别人使用过。在受训的时候，他曾经射击过人形靶。那个人形由皮革与塑料制成外皮，内部装满纯水，被射中之后，里面的水几乎瞬间到达沸点，随即猛然爆开，将整个外皮炸得稀烂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But who, in the absence of war, would fire at a human being? Andwhat human being would withstand a blaster and force its use? Only here,on world made pathological by the disappearance of human beings……</p><p>可是，在没有任何战事的年代，谁会射击一个活生生的人呢？又有什么人敢在手铳之下反抗，令自己死在铳下？只有在这里，在这个由于人类消失而变得病态的世界……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With that odd ability of the brain to note something utterly besidethe point, Trevize was aware of the fact that a cloud had hidden thesun-and then he fired.</p><p>人脑有一种奇特的能力，会注意到一些全然无关紧要的事物。崔维兹现在就是这样，他突然发觉有一团云遮住阳光，与此同时，他按下了扳机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was an odd shimmer of the atmosphere on a straight line fromthe muzzle of the blaster to the dog; a vague sparkle that might havegone unnoticed if the sun were still shining unhindered.</p><p>从铳口延伸到那只狗的直线上，凭空出现一道奇异的闪光，若非云团刚好遮住太阳，那道模糊的光芒可能根本看不到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The dog must have felt the initial surge of heat, and made thesmallest motion as though it were about to leap. And then it exploded,as a portion its blood and cellular contents vaporized.</p><p>那只狗一定突然感到全身发热，身子稍微动了一下，好像准备跳起来。而在下一刹那，它的身体就爆炸了，部分的血液与细胞组织也随即气化。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The explosion made a disappointingly small noise, for the dog'sintegument was simply not as tough as that of the dummies they hadpracticed on. Flesh, skin, blood, and bone were scattered, however,and Trevize felt his stomach heave.</p><p>不过爆炸声却小得令人失望，这是因为狗皮不如人形靶的外皮那般坚韧。然而那只野狗的肌肉、毛皮、鲜血与骨胳仍是四散纷飞，令崔维兹胃部一阵翻腾。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The dogs started back, some having been bombarded with uncomfortablywarm fragments. That was only a momentary hesitation, however. Theycrowded against each other suddenly, in order to eat what had beenprovided. Trevize felt his sickness increase. He was not frighteningthem; he was feeding them. At that rate, they would never leave. In fact,the smell of fresh blood and warm meat would attract still more dogs,and perhaps other smaller predators as well.</p><p>其他的野狗马上后退，有些被高温的碎肉打到，滋味想必不好受。不过，它们只迟疑了片刻，突然又挤成一团，争相吞食那些血肉，使崔维兹感到更加恶心。他没有把它们吓跑，反而为它们提供了食物，它们无论如何是不会离开了。事实上，鲜血与熟肉的气味将引来更多野狗，或许，还会有其他小型猎食动物闻风而至。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A voice called out, "Trevize. What……"</p><p>此时，突然响起一声叫喊：“崔维兹，怎么……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize looked outward. Bliss and Pelorat had emerged from theruins. Bliss had stopped short, her arms thrown out to keep Peloratback. She stared at the dogs. The situation was obvious and clear. Shehad to ask nothing.</p><p>崔维兹向远处望去，宝绮思与裴洛拉特正从废墟中走出来。宝绮思陡然停下脚步，伸出双臂将裴洛拉特挡在后面，双眼则紧盯着那些野狗。情势既清楚又明显，她根本不需要再问什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize shouted, "I tried to drive them off without involving youand Janov. Can you hold them off?"</p><p>崔维兹高声喊道：“我试图把它们赶走，不想惊动你和詹诺夫。你能制住它们吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Barely," said Bliss, not shouting, so that Trevize had troublehearing her even though the dogs' snarling had quieted as though asoothing soundabsorbent blanket had been thrown over them.</p><p>“很困难。”宝绮思答道。虽然狗群的嗥叫静了下来，像是被一大张吸音毯罩住一样，不过她并未用力喊叫，因此崔维兹听得不太清楚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss said, "There are too many of them, and I am not familiar withtheir pattern of neuronic activity. We have no such savage things onGaia."</p><p>宝绮思又说：“它们数量太多了，我又不熟悉它们的神经活动模式，盖娅上没有这种凶残的东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Or on Terminus. Or on any civilized world," shouted Trevize. "I'llshoot as many of them as I can and you try to handle the rest. A smallernumber will give you less trouble."</p><p>“端点星也没有，任何一个文明世界都没有。”崔维兹吼道，“我尽可能杀多少算多少，你试着对付其他的，数量少了你比较好办。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, Trevize. Shooting them will just attract others. Staybehind me, Pel. There's no way you can protect me. Trevize, yourother weapon."</p><p>“不行，崔维兹，射杀它们只会引来其他野狗——待在我后面，裴，你根本无法保护我——崔维兹，你另外那件武器。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The neuronic whip?"</p><p>“神经鞭？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. That produces pain. Low power. Low power!"</p><p>“对，它能激发痛觉。低功率，低功率！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you afraid of hurting them?" called out Trevize in anger. "Isthis a time to consider the sacredness of life?"</p><p>“你担心它们受伤吗？”崔维兹气冲冲地叫道，“现在是顾虑生命神圣的时候吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm considering Pel's. Also mine. Do as I say. Low power, and shootat one of the dogs. I can't hold them much longer."</p><p>“我顾虑的是裴的生命，还有我的生命。低功率，并且对准一只发射，我无法再压制它们多久。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The dogs had drifted away from the tree and had surrounded Bliss andPelorat, who stood with their backs to a crumbling wall. The dogs nearestthe two made hesitant attempts to come closer still, whining a bit asthough trying to puzzle out what it was that held them off when theycould sense nothing that would do it. Some tried uselessly to scrambleup the wall and attack from behind.</p><p>那些野狗早已离开树下，将宝绮思与裴洛拉特团团围住，他们两人则紧靠着一堵断垣残壁。几只最接近他们的野狗，迟疑地试图更为凑近，同时发出几下哼声，仿佛想弄懂是什么阻挡了它们，因为它们感觉不到任何障碍。另外还有几只想爬上那堵危墙，改从后方进攻，但显然是白费力气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize's hand was trembling as he adjusted the neuronic whip to lowpower. The neuronic whip used much less energy than the blaster did,and a single power-cartridge could produce hundreds of whip-like strokesbut, come to think of it, he didn't remember when he had last chargedthis weapon, either.</p><p>崔维兹用颤抖的手将神经鞭调到低功率。神经鞭使用的能量比手铳少得多，一个电源匣能产生好几百下无形的鞭击。可是现在想想，他也不记得上次充电是什么时候。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not so important to aim the whip. Since conserving energy wasnot as critical, he could use it in a sweep across the mass of dogs. Thatwas the traditional method of controlling crowds that showed signs ofturning dangerous.</p><p>发射神经鞭不需要怎么瞄准，因为不必太过顾虑能量的消耗，他可以一下子扫过一大群野狗。那是使用神经鞭的传统方式，专门用来对付现出危险征兆的群众。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>However, he followed Bliss's suggestion. He aimed at one dogand fired. The dog fell over, its legs twitching. It emitted loud,high-pitched squeals.</p><p>不过，他还是照宝绮思的建议去做，瞄准某只野狗射出一鞭。那只狗立刻倒在地上，四肢不停抽搐，同时发出响亮而尖锐的悲鸣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other dogs backed away from the stricken beast, ears flatteningbackward against their heads. Then, squealing in their turn, they turnedand left, at first slowly, then more rapidly, and finally, at a fullrace. The dog who had been hit, scrambled painfully to its legs, andlimped away whimpering, much the last of them.</p><p>其他的野狗纷纷向后退去，离那只受伤的狗愈来愈远，每一只的耳朵都向下压。然后，那些野狗也都发出悲鸣，一个个转身离去，起初是慢慢走，然后速度开始加快，最后变成全速飞奔。那只被神经鞭击中的野狗，此时痛苦万分地爬起来，一面发出哀嚎，一面一跛一跛地走开，脚步落后其他野狗甚多。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The noise vanished in the distance, and Bliss said, "We had betterget into the ship. They will come back. Or others will."</p><p>狗吠声终于在远方消失，宝绮思这才说：“我们最好赶快进太空艇去，它们还会再回来，其他狗群也可能会来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize thought that never before had he manipulated the ship's entrymechanism so rapidly. And it was possible he might never do so again.</p><p>崔维兹不记得曾如此迅速地操作过闸门机制，以后也可能永远破不了这个纪录。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>38</p><p>38</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Night had fallen before Trevize felt somethingapproaching the normal. The small patch of syntho-skin on the scrape onhis hand had soothed the physical pain, but there was a scrape on hispsyche for which soothing was not so easy.</p><p>当夜晚降临时，崔维兹仍然觉得尚未完全恢复正常。他手上刮伤的地方贴了一片合成皮肤，消除了肉体上的疼痛，可是精神上的创伤，并非那么容易就能抚平。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not the mere exposure to danger. He could react to that as wellas any ordinarily brave person might. It was the totally unlooked-fordirection from which the danger had come. It was the feeling of theridiculous. How would it look if people were to find out he had beentreed by snarling dogs ? It would scarcely be worse if hehad been put to flight by the whirring of angry canaries.</p><p>这不仅是暴露于危险中而已，如果只是那样，他的反应会跟任何普通勇者无异。问题是危险来自一个全然未曾预料的方向，带来一种荒谬可笑的感觉。如果有人发现他被一群猛狗逼得上树，那将是什么局面？就算他被一群发怒的金丝雀吓得逃之夭夭，也不比刚才的情况更糟。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For hours, he kept listening for a new attack on the part of thedogs, for ths, sound of howls, for the scratch of claws against theouter hull.</p><p>有好几小时的时间，他一直在倾听外面的动静：那些野狗是否发动了新的攻势，是否有狂吠声，是否有狗爪搔抓艇体的声音。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat, by comparison, seemed quite cool. "There was no question inmy mind, old chap, that Bliss would handle it, but I must say you firedthe weapon well."</p><p>相较之下，裴洛拉特似乎颇为冷静。“我心中从来没有怀疑，老弟，从未怀疑宝绮思能应付这一切。可是我必须承认，你那一击相当精彩。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize shrugged. He was in no mood to discuss the matter.</p><p>崔维兹耸了耸肩，他没有心情讨论这件事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat was holding his library the one compact disc on whichhis lifetime of research into myths and legends were stored andwith it he retreated into his bedroom where he kept his small reader.</p><p>裴洛拉特手中拿着他的“图书馆”，那是一片光碟，上面储存着他毕生研究神话传说的成果。他拿着它钻进寝舱，他的小型阅读机就放在那里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He seemed quite pleased with himself. Trevize noticed that but didn'tfollow it up. Time for that later when his mind wasn't quite as takenup with dogs.</p><p>裴洛拉特的心情似乎相当好，崔维兹注意到了，不过并未追根究底。等到自己的心思不再被野狗完全占据时，还有得是时间弄个明白。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss said, rather tentatively, when the two were alone, "I presumeyou were taken by surprise."</p><p>当宝绮思与他独处的时候，她以试探性的口气说：“我想你是受惊了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quite," said Trevize gloomily. "Who would think that at the sightof a dog a dog I should run for my life."</p><p>“的确如此。”崔维兹以沮丧的口吻答道，“谁会想到看见一条狗——一条狗——就该赶紧逃命。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Twenty thousand years without men and it would not be quite a dog.Those beasts must now be the dominant large predators."</p><p>“此地有两万年不见人迹，它已经不算一只普通的狗。如今在这个世界，这些野兽必定是称王的大型猎食动物。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize nodded. "I figured that out while I was sitting on thetree branch being a dominated prey. You were certainly right about anunbalanced ecology."</p><p>崔维兹点了点头。“当我坐在树枝上，成了一个臣服的猎物时，我就想到了这一点。你所提到的非平衡生态，实在万分正确。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Unbalanced, certainly, from the human standpoint but consideringhow efficiently the dogs seem to be going about their business, I wonderif Pel may be right in his suggestion that the ecology could balanceitself, with various environmental niches being filled by evolvingvariations of the relatively few species that were once brought tothe world."</p><p>“就人类的观点而言，当然是非平衡。但是想想看，那些野狗在进行捕猎时，表现得多么有效率。我想裴也许说对了，生态的确能够自我平衡，从当初被引进这个世界的少数物种，会演化出许多变种，来填补各种的生态席位。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oddly enough," said Trevize, "the same thought occurred to me."</p><p>“可真奇怪，”崔维兹说，“我也有同样的想法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Provided, of course, the unbalance is not so great that the processof righting itself takes too long. The planet might become completelynonviable before that."</p><p>“当然啦，前提是非平衡状态不太严重，否则自我修正的过程需要很长的时间，在成功之前，那颗行星早已回天乏术。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize grunted.</p><p>崔维兹咕哝了一声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss looked at him thoughtfully, "How is it that you thought ofarming yourself?"</p><p>宝绮思若有所思地望着他。“你怎么会想到携带武器？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "It did me little good. It was your ability……"</p><p>崔维兹说：“结果也没什么好处，是你的能力……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not entirely. I needed your weapon. At short notice, with onlyhyperspatial contact with the rest of Gaia, with so many individualminds of so unfamiliar a nature, I could have done nothing without yourneuronic whip."</p><p>“并不尽然，我也需要你的武器。那是毫无预警的情况，我和盖娅又只有超空间式接触，要对付那么多我不熟悉的心灵，若是没有你的神经鞭，我根本无计可施。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My blaster was useless. I tried that."</p><p>“手铳毫无用处，我曾经试过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"With a blaster, Trevize, a dog merely disappears. The rest may besurprised, but not frightened."</p><p>“动用手铳，崔维兹，只能让一只狗消失，其他的狗也许会感到惊讶，可是不会害怕。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Worse than that," said Trevize. "They ate the remnants. I was bribingthem to stay."</p><p>“其实更糟。”崔维兹说，“它们将残骸都吃掉了，我等于贿赂它们留下来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I see that might be the effect. The neuronic whip isdifferent. It inflicts pain, and a dog in pain emits cries of a kind thatare well understood by other dogs who, by conditioned reflex, if nothingelse, begin to feel frightened themselves. With the dogs already disposedtoward fright, I merely nudged their minds, and off they went."</p><p>“没错，我可以想象那种效果。神经鞭则不同，它会带来痛楚，一只狗痛极了便会嚎叫，而别的狗都能了解其中的意义。即使不为其他原因，它们也会由于条件反射而感到恐惧。等所有的野狗都陷入恐惧之后，我只消轻轻推触它们的心灵，它们便自动离开了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but you realized the whip was the more deadly of the two inthis case. I did not."</p><p>“没错，可是你了解在这种情况下，神经鞭是更有威力的武器，我却不知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am accustomed to dealing with minds. You are not. That's why Iinsisted on low power and aiming at one dog. I did not want so much painthat it killed a dog and left him silent. I did not want the pain sodispersed as to cause mere whimpering. I wanted strong pain concentratedat one point."</p><p>“我习惯和心灵打交道，你并没有这方面的经验。我坚持要你使用低功率，并且瞄准一只狗，原因就在这里。我不希望过度的痛楚令那只狗死亡，那样它就发不出声音。我也不希望痛觉太分散，那样只会引起几声低鸣。我要剧烈的痛楚集中在一点上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you got it, Bliss," said Trevize. "It worked perfectly. I oweyou considerable gratitude."</p><p>“果然如你所愿，宝绮思。”崔维兹说，“结果完全成功，我该好好感谢你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You begrudge that," said Bliss thoughtfully, "because it seems to youthat you played a ridiculous role. And yet, I repeat, I could have donenothing without your weapons. What puzzles me is how you can explainyour arming yourself in the face of my assurance that there were nohuman beings on this world, something I am still certain is a fact. Didyou foresee the dogs?"</p><p>“你吝于表达感激，”宝绮思语重心长地说，“因为你觉得自己扮演了一个滑稽的角色。然而，我再重复一遍，没有你的武器，我根本无计可施。令我不解的是，你对携带武器这件事怎么解释？因为我已经向你保证，这个世界上并没有任何人类，这点我至今仍旧肯定。难道你预见了那些野狗吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Trevize. "I certainly didn't. Not consciously, at least. AndI don't habitually go armed, either. It never even occurred to me to puton weapons at Comporellon. But I can't allow myself to trip intothe trap of feeling it was magic, either. It couldn't have been. I suspectthat once we began talking about unbalanced ecologies earlier, I somehowhad an unconscious glimpse of animals grown dangerous in the absence ofhuman beings. That is clear enough in hindsight, but I might have had a whiff of it in foresight. Nothing more than that."</p><p>“没有，”崔维兹说，“我当然没有，至少意识层面如此。而且我通常也没有武装的习惯，在康普隆的时候，我根本没想到带武器。但是，我也不能让自己轻易相信那是魔法，不可能是那样的。我猜想，当我们刚开始讨论非平衡生态时，我就有了一种潜意识的警觉，想到在一个没有人类的世界上，动物可能会变得危险。这一点，事后想来十分明显，但我可能确有一丝先见之明，只不过是这样罢了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss said, "Don't dismiss it that casually. I participated in thesame conversation concerning unbalanced ecologies and I didn't havethat same foresight. It is that special trick of foresight in you thatGaia values. I can see, too, that it must be irritating to you to havea hidden foresight the nature of which you cannot detect; to act withdecision, but without clear reason."</p><p>宝绮思说：“别这么随便就敷衍过去。我同样参加了有关非平衡生态的讨论，却没有同样的先见之明。盖娅所珍视的，正是你这种特殊的预感。我也看得出来，你一定很气恼，因为你拥有一种隐性的预感，却无法侦知它的本质；你根据自己的决定而行动，却没有任何明确的理由。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The usual expression on Terminus is `to act on a hunch.'"</p><p>“在端点星，我们通常的说法是‘凭预感行事’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On Gaia we say, `to know without thought.' You don't like knowingwithout thought, do you?"</p><p>“在盖娅，我们则说‘知其然不知所以然’。你不喜欢不知所以然的感觉，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It bothers me, yes. I don't like being driven by hunches. I assumehunch has reason behind it, but not knowing the reason makes me feelI'm not in control of my own mind a kind of mild madness."</p><p>“是的，的确令我苦恼不已，我并不喜欢被预感驱策。我猜预感背后必有原因，但由于不知道这个原因，使我感到自己无法掌握自己的心灵，好像一种轻度的疯狂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And when you decided in favor of Gaia and Galaxia, you were actingon s hunch, and now you seek the reason."</p><p>“当你决定赞同盖娅和盖娅星系的时候，你就是凭预感行事，现在你却要找出原因。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have said so at least a dozen times."</p><p>“这点我至少说过十几遍了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And I have refused to accept your statement as literal truth. Forthat I am sorry. I will oppose you in this no longer. I hope, though,that I may continue to point out items in Gaia's favor."</p><p>“我却拒绝把你的声明当真，我为这件事感到抱歉。这方面我不会再跟你唱反调，不过我希望，我可以继续指出盖娅的各项优点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Always," said Trevize, "if you, in turn, recognize that I may notaccept them."</p><p>“随时请便，”崔维兹说，“可是希望你了解，我也许不会接受那些说法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does it occur to you, then, that this Unknown World is reverting to akind of savagery, and perhaps to eventual desolation and uninhabitability,because of the removal of a single species that is capable of acting asa guiding intelligence? If the world were Gaia, or better yet, a part ofGalaxia, this could not happen. The guiding intelligence would still existin the form of the Galaxy as a whole, and ecology, whenever unbalanced,and for whatever reason, would move toward balance again."</p><p>“那么，你是否曾经想到，这个不知名的世界正在返归蛮荒状态，最终也许会变得荒芜而不可住人，而这只是因为一种具有足够智慧、能指导整个世界的物种消失了？假如这个世界是盖娅——若是盖娅星系的一部分则更理想——这种事就不会发生。指导的智慧将化身为银河整体，继续留存在这里，不论生态何时偏离平衡，也不论由于什么原因，都终究会再度趋于平衡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does that mean that dogs would no longer eat?"</p><p>“这意味着那些野狗不再需要食物吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course they would eat, just as human beings do. They would however,with purpose, in order to balance the ecology under deliberate direction,and not as a result of random circumstance."</p><p>“它们当然需要食物，正如人类一样。然而，它们进食会是一种有目的的行为，是在刻意的指导之下维持生态平衡，而不是随机条件所造成的结果。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "The loss of individual freedom might not matter to dogs,but it must matter to human beings. And what if all human beings were removed from existence, everywhere, and not merelyon one world or on several? What if Galaxia were left without humanbeings at all? Would there still be a guiding intelligence? Would allother life forms and inanimate matter be able to put together a commonintelligence adequate for the purpose?"</p><p>崔维兹说：“对狗类而言，失去个体的自由也许不算什么，可是这对人类一定会有重大影响。如果所有的人类全部消失，到处都没有了，而并非只是在某个或数个世界上绝迹，那又会怎么样？如果完全没有人类，盖娅星系将变成什么样子？那时还会有指导的智慧吗？其他的生命形态和无生命物质，难道有办法共组一个共同的智慧，足以担负起这个使命吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss hesitated. "Such a situation," she said, "has never beenexperienced. Nor does there seem any likelihood that it will ever beexperienced in the future."</p><p>宝绮思犹豫了一下。“这种情况，”她又说，“以前从未发生过，而在未来，似乎也没有任何可能。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "Hut doesn't it seem obvious to you, that the humanmind is qualitatively different from everything else, and that if itwere absent, the sum total of all other consciousness could not replaceit. Would it not be true, then, that human beings are a special case andmust be treated as such? They should not be fused even with one another,let alone with nonhuman objects."</p><p>崔维兹说：“人类的心灵和宇宙万物性质迥异，万一它消失了，其他所有的意识加起来也无法取代，你难道不认为这很明显吗？所以说，人类是个特例，必须享有特别待遇，这难道不对吗？人类甚至不该彼此融合，更遑论和非人生物或无生物融在一起。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yet you decided in favor of Galaxia."</p><p>“可是你已经决定支持盖娅星系。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For an overriding reason I cannot make out."</p><p>“那是为了一个凌驾一切的理由，我自己也不清楚它是什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps that overriding reason was a glimpse of the effect ofunbalanced ecologies? Might it not have been your reasoning that everyworld in the Galaxy is on a knife-edge, with instability on either side,and that only Galaxia could prevent such disasters as are taking placeon this world to say nothing of the continuing interhuman disastersof war and administrative failure."</p><p>“或许那个凌驾一切的理由，是你隐约瞥见了非平衡生态的效应？你的推论有没有可能是这样的：银河中每个世界都好像立在刀刃上，两侧皆为不稳定的状态，只有盖娅星系能够预防各种灾祸降临在这些世界上。至于连年战祸和腐败政治所带来的苦难，就更不在话下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. Unbalanced ecologies were not in my mind at the time of mydecision."</p><p>“不，当我作出决定时，心中并未想到非平衡生态。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can you be sure?"</p><p>“你怎能确定？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I may not know what it is I'm foreseeing, but if something issuggested afterward, I would recognize it if that were indeed what Iforesaw. As it seems to me I may have foreseen dangerous animalson this world."</p><p>“我所预见的事物，自己当初也许不知道，但事后若有人对我提起，我却能正确无误地认出来。就好像我感觉得到，我当初也许料到了这个世界会有危险的动物。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well," said Bliss soberly, "we might have been dead as a resultof those dangerous animals if it had not been for a combination ofour powers, your foresight and my mentalism. Come, then, let us befriends."</p><p>“嗯，”宝绮思以严肃而平静的口吻说，“若不是我们两人通力合作，你的先见之明加上我的精神力场，那些危险的动物可能已经要了我们的命。来吧，我们做个朋友。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize nodded. "If you wish."</p><p>崔维兹点了点头。“随你的便。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was a chill in his voice that caused Bliss's eyebrows to rise,but at this point Pelorat burst in, nodding his head as though preparedto shake it off its foundations.</p><p>他的声音透着几许冷淡，宝绮思不禁扬起眉毛。但就在这个时候，裴洛拉特突然闯进来，使劲猛点着头，仿佛准备将脑袋从脖子上摇下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I think, he said, "we have it."</p><p>“我想，”他说，“我们找到了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>39</p><p>39</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize did not, in general, believe in easy victories,and yet it was only human to fall into belief against one's betterjudgment. He felt the muscles in his chest and throat tighten, but managedto say, "The location of Earth? Have you discovered that, Janov?"</p><p>崔维兹通常并不相信天上掉下来的胜利，然而，偶尔舍弃自己的明智判断也是人之常情。他现在觉得胸部与喉头的肌肉紧绷，但仍勉强开口问道：“地球的位置吗？你找到了，詹诺夫？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat stared at Trevize for a moment, and deflated. "Well, no,"he said, visibly abashed. "Not quite that. Actually, Golan, notthat aaaall. I had forgotten about that. It was something else that I discovered in the ruins. I suppose it's not really important."</p><p>裴洛拉特瞪了崔维兹一会儿，然后像是泄了气一样。“这个嘛，不是的。”他的脸涨得通红，“不完全是——事实上完全不是，葛兰，我刚才根本忘了那回事。我在废墟中发现的是别的东西，我想它并没有什么重要性。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize managed a long breath and said, "Never mind, Janov. Everyfinding is important. What was it you came in to say?"</p><p>崔维兹深深吸了一口气。“不要紧，詹诺夫。每一项发现都很重要，你跑来是要说什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well," said Pelorat, "it's just that almost nothing survived,you understand. Twenty thousand years of storm and wind don't leavemuch. What's more, plant life is gradually destructive and animallife But never mindaall that. The point is that `almost nothing'</p><p>“嗯，”裴洛拉特说，“你也了解，这里几乎没有什么东西遗留下来。经过两万年的风吹雨打，能留到现在的东西实在不多。此外，植物生命会渐渐破坏遗迹，而动物生命——不过别管这些了，重点是‘几乎没有’并不等于‘完全没有’。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The ruins must have included a public building, for there was somefallen stone, or concrete, with incised lettering upon it. There washardly anything visible, you understand, old chap, but I took photographswith one of those cameras we have on board ship, the kind with built-incomputer enhancement I never got round to asking permission totake one, Golan, but it was important, and I……"</p><p>“这个废墟一定包括一座公共建筑物，因为有些掉落的石块，也有可能是混凝土，上面刻着一些文字。那些字肉眼简直看不出来，你应该了解，老弟，但我拍了许多相片，用太空艇上的相机拍的，就是有内置电脑的那种相机——我从来没机会征得你的同意，葛兰，可是真的很重要，所以我……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize waved his hand in impatient dismissal. "Go on!"</p><p>崔维兹不耐烦地挥了挥手。“说下去！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I could make out some of the lettering, which was very archaic. Evenwith computer enhancement and with my own fair skill at reading Archaic,it was impossible to make out much except for one short phrase. Theletters there were larger and a bit clearer than the rest. They may havebeen incised more deeply because they identified the world itself. Thephrase reads, `Planet Aurora,' so I imagine this world we rest upon isnamed Aurora, or was named Aurora."</p><p>“那些文字我看得懂一些，是非常古老的文字。即使照相机有电脑辅助，再加上我阅读古代文字的功力不差，却也无法认出太多，而真正看懂的就只有一个词。那几个字的字体比较大，也比其他字清楚一点，或许是故意刻得比较深，因为它们代表的正是这个世界。那个词就是‘奥罗拉行星’，所以我猜想，我们立足的这个世界叫奥罗拉，或者说当初叫奥罗拉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It had to be named something," said Trevize.</p><p>“它总该有个名字。”崔维兹说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but names are very rarely chosen at random. I made a carefulsearch of my library just now and there are two old legends, from twowidely spaced worlds, as it happens, so that one can reasonably supposethem to be of independent origin, if one remembers that. But nevermind that. In both legends, Aurora is used as a name for the dawn. Wecan suppose that Aurora may have actually meant dawn insome pre-Galactic language.</p><p>“没错，可是名字很少会随便乱取。我刚才用我的图书馆仔细搜寻了一下，结果发现两则传说，来源刚好是两个相隔甚远的世界，根据这个事实，我们可以作出一个合理的假设，那就是两者的来源完全无关——不过别管这个了，在那两则传说中，奥罗拉当‘曙光’解释，因此我们可以假设，在银河标准语出现之前的某个语言中，奥罗拉的意思正是曙光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As it happens, some word for dawn or daybreak is often used as aname for space stations or other structures that are the first built oftheir kind. If this world is called Dawn in whatever language, it maybe the first of its kind, too."</p><p>“巧的是，同一类型的太空站或其他人造天体，其中第一个便常用曙光或黎明这类名字命名。如果这个世界在某种语言中称为曙光，它也许就是同类世界的第一个。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, "Are you getting ready to suggest that this planet isEarth and that Aurora is an alternate name for it because it representsthe dawn of life and of man?"</p><p>崔维兹问道：“你是不是准备告诉我们，这颗行星就是地球，而奥罗拉是它的别名，因为这个名字代表了生命和人类的黎明？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat said, "I couldn't go that far, Golan."</p><p>裴洛拉特说：“我不敢延伸那么远，葛兰。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize said, with a trace of bitterness, "There is, after all,no radioactive surface, no giant satellite, no gas giant with hugerings."</p><p>崔维兹带着点挖苦的口气说：“毕竟我们没发现放射性地表，没发现巨大卫星，也没发现具有大型行星环的气态巨星。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly. But Deniador, back on Comporellon, seemed to think thiswas one of the worlds that was once inhabited by the first wave ofSettlers the Spacers. If it were, then its name, Aurora, mightindicate it to have been the first of those Spacer worlds. We might,at this very moment, be resting on the oldest human world in the Galaxyexcept for Earth itself. Isn't that exciting?"</p><p>“一点都没错。可是康普隆的那个丹尼亚多，他似乎认为这个世界曾是第一波殖民者——太空族定居的众多世界之一。果真如此的话，那么它既然叫奥罗拉，也许就表示它是第一个太空世界。此时此刻我们踏着的这颗行星，很可能是除了地球之外，银河中最古老的人类世界。这难道不令人兴奋吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Interesting, at any rate, Janov, but isn't that a great deal toinfer merely from the name, Aurora?"</p><p>“不管怎么说，的确很有意思，詹诺夫。可是仅由奥罗拉一个名字，就推出这些结论，会不会嫌太多了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There's more," said Pelorat excitedly. "As far as I could checkin my records there is no world in the Galaxy today with the name of`Aurora,' and I'm sure your computer will verify that. As I said, thereare all sorts of world and other objects named `Dawn' in various ways,but no one uses the actual word `Aurora.'"</p><p>“还不止呢。”裴洛拉特兴奋地说，“我找遍了我所搜集的记录，结果发现当今银河中，没有一个世界叫奥罗拉，我确定你的电脑能证实这一点。正如我刚才所说，许多世界和人造天体都以曙光这一类名字命名，可是没有一个真正使用奥罗拉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why should they? If it's a pre-Galactic word, it wouldn't be likelyto be popular."</p><p>“何必要用呢？如果它是在银河标准语之前的词汇，如今就不大可能流行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But names do remain, even when they're meaningless. Ifthis were the first settled world, it would be famous; it might even,for a while, have been the dominant world of the Galaxy. Surely, therewould be other worlds calling themselves `New Aurora,' or `Aurora Minor,'</p><p>“可是名字会保留下来，即使它们已经毫无意义。如果这里真是第一个殖民世界，它应该很有名气，甚至可能一度曾是银河的主宰。所以说，一定会有其他世界自称‘新奥罗拉’或‘小奥罗拉’，或者诸如此类的名称。而其他的……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>or something like that. And then others "Trevize broke in. "Perhaps it wasn't the first settled world. Perhapsit was never of any importance."</p><p>崔维兹突然插嘴道：“也许它并非第一个殖民世界，也许它从来没有什么重要性。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There's a better reason in my opinion, my dear chap."</p><p>“依我看有个更好的解释，我亲爱的兄弟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What would that be, Janov?"</p><p>“什么样的解释，詹诺夫？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If the first wave of settlements was overtaken by a second waveto which all the worlds of the Galaxy now belong as Deniadorsaid then there is very likely to have been a period of hostilitybetween the two waves. The second wave making up the worlds thatnow exist would not use the names given to any of the worlds ofthe first wave. In that way, we can infer from the fact that the name`Aurora' has never been repeated that there were two waves of Settlers,and that this is a world of the first wave."</p><p>“假如第二波殖民者后来居上，因此当今银河各个世界都是他们的天下，正如丹尼亚多所说，那么就很有可能，两波殖民者之间曾经出现敌对状态，所以第二波殖民者，也就是如今这些世界的建立者，不会使用第一波殖民世界的名字。如此说来，我们即可根据奥罗拉这个名字从未重复的事实，推论出总共有两波殖民者，而此地是第一波殖民者所建立的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize smiled. "I'm getting a glimpse of how you mythologists work,Janov. You build a beautiful superstructure, but it may be standingon air. The legends tell us that the Settlers of the first wave wereaccompanied by numerous robots, and that these were supposed to be theirundoing. Now if we could find a robot on this world, I'd be willingto accept all this first-wave supposition, but we can't expect aftertwenty thou……"</p><p>崔维兹微微一笑。“我稍微弄懂了你们神话学家如何做学问，詹诺夫。你们总是建立一个美丽的理论体系，但它也许只是空中楼阁。传说告诉我们，第一波殖民者带了许多机器人随行，而这想必就是他们覆灭的原因。假使我们能在这个世界上找到一个机器人，我就愿意接受所有关于第一波殖民者的推测，可是我们不能指望经过两万……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pelorat, whose mouth had been working, managed to find his voice. "But,Golan, haven't I told you? No, of course, I haven't. I'm soexcited I can't put things in the right order. There was a robot."</p><p>裴洛拉特的嘴巴嚅动了好久，才终于发出声音来。“可是，葛兰，我没告诉你吗？没有，当然没有，我太兴奋了，没法子把事情说得有条有理——这里的确有个机器人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>40</p><p>40</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize rubbed his forehead, almost as though he werein pain. He said, "A robot? There was a robot?"</p><p>崔维兹搓了搓额头，仿佛正为头痛所苦。“一个机器人？这里有个机器人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said Pelorat, nodding his head emphatically.</p><p>“对。”裴洛拉特使劲点头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How do you know?"</p><p>“你怎么知道？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, it was a robot. How could I fail to know one if I see one?"</p><p>“哎呀，它当然是机器人。我亲眼看到的，怎么可能认不出来？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have you ever seen a robot before?"</p><p>“你以前见过机器人吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, but it was a metal object that looked like a human being. Head,arms, legs, torso. Of course, when I say metal, it was mostly rust, andwhen I walked toward it, I suppose the vibration of my tread damaged itfurther, so that when I reached to touch it……"</p><p>“没有，但它是个看来很像人类的金属物体，有脑袋、双手、双脚和躯干。当然啦，我所谓的金属，其实几乎是一堆铁锈。当我向它走近时，想必是脚步的震动使它进一步受损，所以当我伸手摸它……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why should you touch it?"</p><p>“你为什么要摸它？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, I suppose I couldn't quite believe my eyes. It was an automaticresponse. As soon as I touched it, it crumbled. But ……"</p><p>“这个嘛，我想是因为我无法完全相信自己的眼睛，那是一种自然而然的反应。我才刚碰到它，它就散了开来，可是——”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes?"</p><p>“怎样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Before it quite did, its eyes seemed to glow very faintly and itmade a sound as though it were trying to say something."</p><p>“在它真正散开来之前，它的眼睛似乎放出非常微弱的光芒，同时发出一个声音，像是试图说些什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You mean it was still functioning ?"</p><p>“你的意思是它还在运作？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Just barely, Golan. Then it collapsed."</p><p>“非常勉强，葛兰，然后它就崩溃了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize turned to Bliss. "Do you corroborate all this, Bliss?"</p><p>崔维兹转向宝绮思。“你能证实这一切吗，宝绮思？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was a robot, and we saw it," said Bliss.</p><p>“那是个机器人，我俩都看到了。”宝绮思说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And was it still functioning?"</p><p>“而它仍在运作？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss said tonelessly, "As it crumbled, I caught a faint sense ofneuronic activity."</p><p>宝绮思以平板的语调说：“当它散开来的时候，我捕捉到一丝微弱的神经活动讯息。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can there have been neuronic activity? A robot doesn't have anorganic brain built of cells."</p><p>“怎么可能有神经活动？机器人并没有细胞所组成的有机大脑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It has the computerized equivalent, I imagine," said Bliss, "and Iwould detect that."</p><p>“我猜想，它具有电脑化的类似结构，”宝绮思说，“而我侦测得到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Did you detect a robotic rather than a human mentality?"</p><p>“你侦测到的是机器人的精神作用，不是人类的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Bliss pursed her lips and said, "It was too feeble to decide anythingabout it except that it was there."</p><p>宝绮思撅了撅嘴。“它太微弱了，我只知道它的确存在，无法作出其他判断。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Trevize looked at Bliss, then at Pelorat, and said, in a tone ofexasperation, "This changes everything."</p><p>崔维兹先望着宝绮思，然后望向裴洛拉特，以激昂的口气说：“这就足以改变一切。”</p></div>
