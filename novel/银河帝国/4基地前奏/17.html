<div class='layout'><p>17 Wye</p><p>第17章 卫荷</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>WYE:……A sector of the world-city of Trantor……In the latter centuries of the Galactic Empire, Wye was the strongest and stablest portion of the world-city. Its rulers had long aspired to the Imperial throne, justifying that by their descent from early Emperors. Under Mannix IV, Wye was militarized and (Imperial authorities later claimed) was planning a planet-wide coup .</p><p>卫荷：……川陀这个世界型都会的一个行政区……在银河帝国最后数世纪，卫荷是这个世界型都会中最强盛且最稳定的部分。长久以来，其统治者一直在觊觎帝位，而且自认师出有名，理由是他们的祖先曾当过皇帝。在曼尼克斯四世统治下，卫荷整军经武，而且（帝国当局事后宣称）计划一场全球性军事政变……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p><p>……《银河百科全书》</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The man who entered was tall and muscular. He had a long blond mustache that curled up at the tips and a fringe of hair that went down the sides of his face and under his chin, leaving the point of his chin and his lower lip smoothly bare and seeming a little moist. His head was so closely cropped and his hair was so light that, for one unpleasant moment, Seldon was reminded of Mycogen. </p><p>进来的人高头大马、肌肉结实。他有两撇很长的金色胡须，末端微微翘起；两绺发束从脸颊两侧垂下来；下巴与下唇刮得光溜溜，而且似乎有点潮湿。他的头发修剪得非常短，并且由于颜色很淡，令谢顿不禁忆起麦曲生的种种不快。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The newcomer wore what was unmistakably a uniform. It was red and white and about his waist was a wide belt decorated with silver studs. </p><p>那人所穿的无疑是一套制服。它的颜色红白相间，腰际有一条宽大的皮带，上面装饰着几颗银扣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His voice, when he spoke, was a rolling bass and its accent was not like any that Seldon had heard before. Most unfamiliar accents sounded uncouth in Seldons experience, but this one seemed almost musical, perhaps because of the richness of the low tones.</p><p>当他开口时，声音有如隆隆作响的低音乐器，口音则是谢顿从未听过的。在谢顿的经验中，不熟悉的口音大多听来相当粗鲁，但此人的声音却几乎像音乐，或许是醇厚的低音所造成的印象。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am Sergeant Emmer Thalus," he rumbled in a slow succession of syllables. "I have come seeking Dr. Hari Seldon."</p><p>“我是爱玛·塔勒斯中士，”他吐出低沉、嘹亮而缓慢的连续音节，“我来找哈里·谢顿博士。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I am he." In an aside to Dors, he muttered, "if Hummin couldnt come himself, he certainly sent a magnificent side of beef to represent him."</p><p>谢顿说：“我就是。”他又别过头来，低声对铎丝说：“即使夫铭无法亲自前来，他显然派了一个优秀的大块头来代表他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant favored Seldon with a stolid and slightly prolonged look. Then he said, "Yes. You have been described to me. Please come with me, Dr. Seldon."</p><p>中士对谢顿投以漠然且稍嫌冗长的一瞥，然后说：“没错，上级对我描述过你的样子。谢顿博士，请跟我走吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Lead the way."</p><p>谢顿说：“带路。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant stepped backward. Seldon and Dors Venabili stepped forward. </p><p>中士向后退去，谢顿与铎丝·凡纳比里则向前迈开脚步。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant stopped and raised a large hand, palm toward Dors. "I have been instructed to take Dr. Hari Seldon with me. I have not been instructed to take anyone else."</p><p>中士突然停下，然后举起巨大的手掌，作势挡住铎丝。“上级命令我来接哈里·谢顿博士，没有命令我接其他任何人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a moment, Seldon looked at him uncomprehendingly. Then his look of surprise gave way to anger. "Its quite impossible that you have been told that, Sergeant. Dr. Dors Venabili is my associate and my companion. She must come with me."</p><p>谢顿望着他，一时之间无法理解是怎么回事。不久，他的惊讶转成了愤怒。“你竟然会接到这种命令，中士，这简直是不可能的事。铎丝·凡纳比里博士是我的同事和同伴，她一定要跟我去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That is not in accordance with my instructions, Doctor."</p><p>“博士，这和我的命令不符。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't care about your instructions in any way, Sergeant Thalus. I do not budge without her."</p><p>“我才不管你的什么命令呢，塔勒斯中士。不让她去的话，我一步也不走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whats more," said Dors with clear irritation, "my instructions are to protect Dr. Seldon at all times. I cannot do that unless I am with him. Therefore, where he goes, I go."</p><p>“此外，”铎丝带着明显的怒意说，“我所奉的命令，则是时时刻刻保护谢顿博士。除非我跟他在一起，否则我无法完成任务。因此不论他到哪里，我都要跟去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant looked puzzled. "My instructions are strict that I see to it that no harm comes to you, Dr. Seldon. If you Will not come voluntarily, I must carry you to my vehicle. I Will try to do so gently." </p><p>中士显得十分为难。“谢顿博士，我的命令严格要求我确保你不会受到伤害。倘若你不肯自愿前去，我不得不把你抱进我的交通工具。我会试着动作尽量温和。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He extended his two arms as though to seize Seldon by the waist and carry him off bodily.</p><p>他伸出两只手臂，仿佛要抓向谢顿的腰际，把他整个抱起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon skittered backward and out of reach. As he did so, the side of his right palm came down on the sergeants right upper arm where the muscles were thinnest, so that he struck the bone.</p><p>谢顿向后一跳，让对方扑了个空。与此同时，他的右手掌缘击向中士的右臂上方，落点刚好是肌肉最少的部位，因此直接打击到骨头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant drew a sudden deep breath and seemed to shake himself a bit, but turned, face expressionless, and advanced again. Davan, watching, remained where he was, motionless, but Raych moved behind the sergeant.</p><p>中士突然深深倒抽一口气，身体似乎晃了一下，但他随即转身，脸上毫无表情，再度向谢顿走去。达凡始终目不转睛，身子也一动不动，芮奇却已来到中士身后。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon repeated his palm stroke a second time, then a third, but now Sergeant Thalus, anticipating the blow, lowered his shoulder to catch it on hard muscle. </p><p>谢顿接二连三重复他的掌击，但塔勒斯中士现在已有准备，他垂下肩头，让坚硬的肌肉承受这些攻击。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors had drawn her knives.</p><p>铎丝则已拔出她的双刀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sergeant," she said forcefully. "Turn in this direction, I want you to understand I may be forced to hurt you severely if you persist in attempting to carry Dr. Seldon off against his will."</p><p>“中士，”她强有力地说，“把头转到这个方向。我要你了解，假如你硬要强行带走谢顿博士，我也许不得不重伤你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant paused, seemed to take in the slowly waving knives solemnly, then said, "It is not in my instructions to refrain from harming anyone but Dr. Seldon."</p><p>中士顿了一下，似乎在以严肃的态度估量那两把缓缓挥动的利刃。然后他说：“在我的命令中，并未限制我伤害谢顿博士以外的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His right hand moved with surprising speed toward the neuronic whip in the holster at his hip. Dors moved as quickly forward, knives flashing. </p><p>他的右手以惊人的速度伸向臀边皮套中的神经鞭。铎丝飞快挺进，双刀一齐刺出。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Neither completed the movement.</p><p>两人都没有完成动作。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dashing forward, Raych had pushed at the sergeants back with his left hand and withdrew the sergeants weapon from its holster with his right. He moved away quickly, holding the neuronic whip in both hands now and shouting, "Hands up, Sergeant, or youre gonna get it!"</p><p>说时迟那时快，芮奇猛然向前冲来，左手推向中士的背部，右手则从皮套中抽走神经鞭。他迅速闪开，现在正以双手握着那柄武器，喊道：“举起手来，中士，否则你就要挨一记！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant whirled and a nervous look crossed his reddening face. It was the only moment that its stolidity had weakened. "Put that down, sonny," he growled. "You don't know how it works."</p><p>中士做了个回旋，渐渐涨红的脸孔掠过一丝紧张的表情，这是他唯一不那么漠然的一刻。“放下来，老弟。”他咆哮道，“你不知道怎么用。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych howled, "I know about the safety. Its off and this thing can fire. And it Will if you try to rush me."</p><p>芮奇怒吼道：“我知道什么是保险开关，它现在开着，这东西可以发射。如果你试图向我冲来，它就真会发射。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant froze. He clearly knew how dangerous it was to have an excited twelve-year-old handling a powerful weapon.</p><p>中士全身僵住。他显然知道，让一个激动的十二岁少年掌握一柄强力武器有多危险。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Nor did Seldon feel much better. He said, "Careful, Raych. don't shoot. Keep your finger off the contact."</p><p>谢顿的感受也好不了多少，他说：“小心，芮奇。别发射，你的手指别碰开关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I aint gonna let him rush me."</p><p>“我不会让他向我冲来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He wont……Sergeant, please don't move. Lets get something straight. You were told to take me away from here. Is that right?"</p><p>“他不会的。中士，请别动，让我们把事情弄清楚。上级叫你把我带离这里，是这样的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thats right," said the sergeant, eyes somewhat protruding and firmly fixed on Raych (whose eyes were as firmly fixed on the sergeant).</p><p>“是这样的。”中士说，他的眼睛几乎鼓起来，而且紧紧盯在芮奇身上（芮奇的双眼也紧紧盯在中士身上）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "But you were not told to take anyone else. Is that right?"</p><p>“可是上级未曾叫你带走其他人，是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I was not, Doctor," said the sergeant firmly. Not even the threat of a neuronic whip was going to make him weasel. One could see that.</p><p>“博士，没有，我没接到这种命令。”中士坚决地说。甚至神经鞭的威胁也无法逼他做出狡辩，这点谁都看得出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Very well, but listen to me, Sergeant. Were you told not to take anyone else?"</p><p>“非常好，不过听我说，中士，上级曾叫你别带走其他人吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I just said……"</p><p>“我刚说过……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, no. Listen, Sergeant. Theres a difference. Were your instructions simply Take Dr. Seldon!? Was that the entire order, with no mention of anyone else, or were the orders more specific? Were your orders as follows: Take Dr. Seldon and don't take anyone else?"</p><p>“不，不，听好，中士，这有分别。你接到的命令是否只是‘带谢顿博士来’？整个命令就是这样，并未提到其他人，还是命令的内容更加特定？你接到的命令是不是‘带谢顿博士来，别带其他任何人’？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant turned that over in his head, then he said, "I was told to take you, Dr. Seldon."</p><p>中士的脑子转了几转，然后他说：“谢顿博士，上级叫我带你走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then there was no mention of anyone else, one way or the other, was there?"</p><p>“那么并没有提到其他人，什么都没提到，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pause. "No."</p><p>顿了一下之后：“没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You were not told to take Dr. Venabili, but you were not told not to take Dr. Venabili either. Is that right?"</p><p>“上级没有叫你带走凡纳比里博士，但也没有叫你别带凡纳比里博士。是不是这样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Pause. "Yes."</p><p>顿了一下之后：“是的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So you can either take her or not take her, whichever you please?"</p><p>“因此你可以带她也可以不带，随你高兴？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Long pause. "I suppose so."</p><p>停顿很长一段时间之后：“我想是的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now then, heres Raych, the young fellow whos got a neuronic whip pointing at you……your neuronic whip, remember……and he is anxious to use it."</p><p>“那么，这是芮奇，这位拿着神经鞭指着你的年轻朋友……你的神经鞭，记住……而且他迫不及待要动用了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yay!" shouted Raych.</p><p>“是啊！”芮奇喊道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not yet, Raych," said Seldon. "And here is Dr. Venabili with two knives that she can use very expertly and theres myself, who can, if I get the chance, break your Adams apple with one hand so that youll never speak above a whisper again. Now then, do you want to take Dr. Venabili or don't you want to? Your orders allow you to do either."</p><p>“芮奇，还不要。”谢顿说，“这是凡纳比里博士，手中握着两把刀，她可是这种武器的大行家。此外还有我，如果逮到机会，我能用一只手抓烂你的喉结，令你再也发不出比耳语更大的声音。好啦，你是要带凡纳比里博士同行，还是不要这样做？你奉的命令允许你自己选择。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And finally the sergeant said in a beaten voice, "I Will take the woman."</p><p>最后，中士以战败的声音说：“我会带这个女的一起走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And the boy, Raych."</p><p>“还有那个男孩，芮奇。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And the boy."</p><p>“还有那个男孩。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Good. Have I your word of honor……your word of honor as a soldier……that you Will do as you have just said……honestly?"</p><p>“很好。你能以荣誉向我担保吗？以军人的荣誉担保，你会照你刚才说的去做……诚实无欺？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have my word of honor as a soldier," said the sergeant.</p><p>“我以军人的荣誉向你担保。”中士说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Good. Raych, give back the whip……Now……Dont make me wait."</p><p>“很好。芮奇，把神经鞭还给他……赶快，别让我等。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych, his face twisted into an unhappy grimace, looked at Dors, who hesitated and then slowly nodded her head. Her face was as unhappy as Raychs. </p><p>芮奇露出一副夸张的愁眉苦脸，转头向铎丝望去。铎丝犹豫了一下，然后缓缓点了点头，她的表情也像芮奇一样凝重。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych held out the neuronic whip to the sergeant and said, "Theyre makin me, ya big……" His last words were unintelligible.</p><p>芮奇将神经鞭递给中士，并且说：“是他们要我这样做的，你这大ⅩⅩ。”最后两个字谁也听不懂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Put away your knives, Dors."</p><p>谢顿又说：“收起你的刀子，铎丝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors shook her head, but put them away.</p><p>铎丝摇摇头，但还是将双刀收了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now, Sergeant?" said Seldon.</p><p>“如何，中士？”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant looked at the neuronic whip, then at Seldon. He said, "You are an honorable man, Dr. Seldon, and my word of honor holds." With a military snap, he placed his neuronic whip in his holster.</p><p>中士先望着神经鞭，然后又望向谢顿。“你是个可敬的人，谢顿博士，我的荣誉担保一定算数。”他以利落的动作将神经鞭放回皮套中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon turned to Davan and said, "Davan, please forget what you have seen here. We three are going voluntarily with Sergeant Thalus. You tell Yugo Amaryl when you see him that I Will not forget him and that, once this is over and I am free to act, I Will see that he gets into a University. And if theres anything reasonable I can ever do for your cause, Davan, I will……Now, Sergeant, lets go."</p><p>谢顿转头对达凡说：“达凡，请忘掉你在这里所见到的一切。我们三人是自愿随塔勒斯中士走的。当你见到雨果·阿马瑞尔时，告诉他说我不会忘记他，一旦这件事告一段落，我能自由行动之后，我保证会把他送进一所大学。此外，达凡，倘若有任何合理的事，是我能为你效力的，我一定都会做……好啦，中士，我们走吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have you ever been in an air-jet before, Raych?" asked Hari Seldon.</p><p>“你以前搭乘过喷射机吗，芮奇？”哈里·谢顿问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych shook his head speechlessly. He was looking down at Upperside rushing beneath them with a mixture of fright and awe.</p><p>芮奇默默摇了摇头。他正以惊恐与敬畏交集的心情，望着“上方”猛然掠过他们脚下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It struck Seldon again how much Trantor was a world of Expressways and tunnels. Even long trips were made underground by the general population. Air travel, however common it might be on the Outworlds, was a luxury on Trantor and an air-jet like this…… </p><p>这使谢顿再度想到，川陀是个多么依赖捷运与隧道的世界。对一般大众而言，即使长距离旅行也都在地底进行。不论空中旅行在外星世界多么普遍，它在川陀却是一项奢侈。至于像这样的一架喷射机……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How had Hummin managed it? Seldon wondered.</p><p>夫铭是怎样做到的？谢顿实在纳闷。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked out the window at the rise and fall of the domes, at the general green in this area of the planet, the occasional patches of what were little less than jungles, the arms of the sea they occasionally passed over, with its leaden waters taking on a sudden all-too-brief sparkle when the sun peeped out momentarily from the heavy cloud layer.</p><p>他透过机窗向外望去，看见了起伏的穹顶，看见了川陀这一带的无际苍翠，以及时隐时现、无异于丛林的深绿色斑点，还有不时通过的一些海湾……当太阳从浓厚的云层里短暂露脸时，铅色的海水便会在那一瞬间闪闪发光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>An hour or so into the flight, Dors, who was viewing a new historical novel without much in the way of apparent enjoyment, clicked it off and said, "I wish I knew where weeeere going."</p><p>铎丝原本在看一本新的历史小说，但没有显露多大的兴趣。大约飞行了一小时之后，她突然将影视书“咔嗒”一声关掉，说道：“我真希望知道我们正往哪儿去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you cant tell," said Seldon, "then I certainly cant. Youve been on Trantor longer than I have."</p><p>“假如你无从判断，”谢顿说，“那我当然更不行。你在川陀待得比我久。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but only on the inside," said Dors. "Out here, with only Upperside below me, Im as lost as an unborn infant would be."</p><p>“没错，不过只是在里面。”铎丝说，“一旦到了外面，只有上方在我脚下，我就像未出世的胎儿一般茫然。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh well……Presumably, Hummin knows what hes doing."</p><p>“喔，好吧。想必夫铭知道自己在做什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im sure he does," replied Dors rather tartly, "but that may have nothing to do with the present situation. Why do you continue to assume any of this represents his initiative?"</p><p>“我确定他知道，”铎丝以颇为锋利的语气答道，“但那或许和现在的情势毫无关系。你为什么仍旧假设这些都代表他的谋划？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldons eyebrows lifted. "Now that you ask, I don't know. I just assumed it. Why shouldnt this be his?"</p><p>谢顿扬起眉毛。“经你这么一问，我还真不知道，我只是假设而已。为什么不该是他的谋划呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because whoever arranged it didn't specify that I be taken along with you. I simply don't see Hummin forgetting my existence. And because he didn't come himself, as he did at Streeling and at Mycogen."</p><p>“因为不论是谁安排这项行动，都没有特别交代把我一起带走，我就是不信夫铭会忘记我这个人。而且他并未亲自前来，这和前两次在斯璀璘以及麦曲生不一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You cant always expect him to, Dors. He might well be occupied. The astonishing thing is not that he didn't come on this occasion but that he did come on the previous ones."</p><p>“你不能总是指望他那样做，铎丝，他很有可能是分身乏术。应该惊讶的不是这回他没来，而是前两次他竟然亲自来了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Assuming he didn't come himself, would he send a conspicuous and lavish flying palace like this?" She gestured around her at the large luxurious jet.</p><p>“即便无法亲自前来，他会派一座这么显眼、这么豪奢的飞行宫殿来吗？”她朝四面八方指了指这架大型豪华喷射机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It might simply have been available. And he might have reasoned that no one would expect something as noticeable as this to be carrying fugitives who were desperately trying to avoid detection. The well-known double-double-cross."</p><p>“也许只不过是它刚好有空。而且他也许做过一番推理，没有人会怀疑，像这么显眼的东西，会载着两个拼命想要躲避耳目的逃亡者。这是着名的负负得正法则。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Too well-known, in my opinion. And would he send an idiot like Sergeant Thalus in his place?"</p><p>“在我看来，有点太着名了。他又怎么会派一个像塔勒斯中士这样的白痴来？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The sergeant is no idiot. Hes simply been trained to complete obedience. With proper instructions, he could be utterly reliable."</p><p>“这位中士并不是白痴，他只是被训练得绝对服从。只要有适当的命令，他能百分之百可靠。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There you are, Hari. We come back to that. Why didn't he get proper instructions? Its inconceivable to me that Chetter Hummin would tell him to carry you out of Dahl and not say a word about me. Inconceivable."</p><p>“你看，哈里，我们又兜回来了。为什么他没接到适当的命令？我感到不可思议，契特·夫铭竟然只告诉他把你带离达尔，却没有一个字提到我。实在不可思议。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And to that Seldon had no anseer and his spirits sank.</p><p>对于这个问题，谢顿没有任何答案，他的心开始往下沉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Another hour passed and Dors said, "It looks as if its getting colder outside. The green of Upperside is turning brown and I believe the heaters have turned on."</p><p>又过了一个小时之后，铎丝说：“看来外面好像越来越冷。原本青翠的上方变得枯黄，而且我相信暖气已经打开了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What does that signify?"</p><p>“这代表什么意义？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Dahl is in the tropic zone so obviously were going either north or south……and a considerable distance too. If I had some notion in which direction the nightline was I could tell which."</p><p>“达尔位于热带，所以显然我们正在向北或向南飞……而且飞了很可观的距离。我如果清楚昼夜界线在哪个方向，便能判断是南是北。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Eventually, they passed over a section of shoreline where there was a rim of ice hugging the domes where they were rimmed by the sea. </p><p>最后，他们通过一段海岸线，有一串冰紧贴着那些滨海穹顶与海水的接壤处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then, quite unexpectedly, the air-jet angled downward.</p><p>然后，在几乎毫无预警的情况下，喷射机开始俯冲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych screamed, "Were goin to hit! Were goin to smash up!"</p><p>芮奇尖叫道：“我们要坠毁啦！我们要撞得粉碎！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldons abdominal muscles tightened and he clutched the arms of his seat. Dors seemed unaffected.</p><p>谢顿感到腹肌绷紧，他用力抓住座椅扶手。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, "The pilots up front don't seem alarmed. Well be tunneling."</p><p>铎丝似乎不为所动，她说：“驾驶员们似乎并不惊慌。我们是要钻进隧道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And, as she said so, the jets wings swept backward and under it and, like a bullet, the air-jet entered a tunnel. Blackness swept back over them in an instant and a moment later the lighting system in the tunnel turned on. The walls of the tunnel snaked past the jet on either side.</p><p>就在她这么说的时候，机翼已经开始向后并向下收拢，接着，喷射机像一颗子弹一样飞进隧道。最初的一刹那，他们被一片黑暗笼罩；而在下一刻，隧道内的照明系统便已开启。向外望去，隧道两旁的墙壁正蜿蜒地掠过机身。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't suppose Ill ever be sure they know the tunnel isn't  already occupied," muttered Seldon.</p><p>“我想我绝对无法肯定，他们知道这条隧道已经空出来。”谢顿喃喃道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im sure they had reassurance of a clear tunnel some dozens of kilometers earlier," said Dors. "At any rate, I presume this is the last stage of the journey and soon well know where we are."</p><p>“我确信在好几十公里外，他们便确认过隧道无人使用。”铎丝说，“无论如何，我推测这是此趟旅程的最后一个阶段，我们很快便会知道身在何处。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She paused and then added, "And I further presume we wont like the knowledge when we have it."</p><p>她顿了一顿，然后补充道：“我进一步的推测是，我们不会喜欢那个答案。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The air-jet sped out of the tunnel and onto a long runway with a roof so high that it seemed closer to true daylight than anything Seldon had seen since he had left the Imperial Sector.</p><p>喷射机急速飞出隧道，降落在一条很长的跑道上。跑道正上方有个非常高的顶棚，自从谢顿离开皇区后，从未见过如此接近天然日光的环境。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They came to a halt in a shorter time than Seldon would have expected, but at the price of an uncomfortable pressure forward. Raych, in particular, was crushed against the seat before him and was finding it difficult to breathe till Dorss hand on his shoulder pulled him back slightly.</p><p>他们不久便停下来，滑行时间比谢顿的预期还要短，代价却是一股难受的压力。尤其是芮奇，他全身压在前面的椅背上，连呼吸都有困难，直到铎丝将他的肩头稍向后拉，他才松了一口气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sergeant Thalus, impressive and erect, left the jet and moved to the rear, where he opened the door of the passenger compartment and helped the three out, one by one.</p><p>相貌堂堂、身形笔直的塔勒斯中士离开前座，向喷射机后面走来。他打开旅客舱的舱门，扶助他们三人逐一下机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was last. He half-turned as he passed the sergeant, saying, "It was a pleasant trip, Sergeant."</p><p>谢顿是最后一个。经过中士身边时，他半转过头来说：“中士，这是一趟愉快的旅程。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A slow smile spread over the sergeants large face and lifted his mustachioed upper lip. He touched the visor of his cap in what was half a salute and said, "Thank you again, Doctor."</p><p>一抹笑容在中士宽大的脸庞上缓缓扩散，使他留着胡子的上唇扬了起来。他像敬礼似地碰了一下帽檐，说道：“博士，再次谢谢你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were then ushered into the backseat of a ground-car of lavish design and the sergeant himself pushed into the front seat and drove the vehicle with a surprisingly light touch.</p><p>接着，他们在引导之下，进入一辆外型高贵的地面车的后座。中士自己则钻进前座，以惊人的轻巧动作驾驶着这辆车。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They passed through wide roadways, flanked by tall, well-designed buildings, all glistening in broad daylight. As elsewhere on Trantor, they heard the distant drone of an Expressway. The walkways were crowded with what were, for the most part, well-dressed people. The surroundings were remarkably……almost excessively……clean.</p><p>他们穿过一些宽阔的道路，两侧都是高大而壮丽的建筑，通通在充足的日光下闪闪发亮。如同在川陀其他地方一样，他们听到远处有捷运的隆隆声。人行道上挤满了人，大多数都穿得很体面。周遭的环境十分清洁，几乎可说清洁得过分。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldons sense of security sank further. Dorss misgivings concerning their destination now seemed justified after all. He leaned toward her and said, "Do you think we are back in the Imperial Sector?"</p><p>谢顿的安全感从黄灯转为红灯。铎丝对于目的地的忧心，如今似乎终于应验。他凑近她说：“你认为我们回到皇区了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, "No, the buildings are more rocooo in the Imperial Sector and theres less Imperial parkishness to this sector……if you know what I mean."</p><p>她说：“不，皇区的建筑更具洛可可风，而且本区欠缺皇家庭园的风味……你该知道我的意思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then where are we, Dors?</p><p>“铎丝，那么我们在哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well have to ask, Im afraid, Hari."</p><p>“哈里，只怕我们得问问。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was not a long trip and soon they rolled into a car-bay that flanked an imposing four-story structure. A frieze of imaginary animals ran along the top, decorated with strips of warm pink stone. It was an impressive facade with a rather pleasing design.</p><p>这并非一趟长途旅程，他们很快就来到一个停车坪，旁边则是一座富丽堂皇的四层楼建筑。那座建筑物顶端横亘着一道檐壁，上面雕刻着许多想象中的动物，并装饰着粉红暖色的石头所排成的条纹。建筑物的外表极为壮观，拥有一个讨人喜欢的外型。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "That certainly looks rocooo enough."</p><p>谢顿说：“那座建筑，看来无疑洛可可十足。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors shrugged uncertainly.</p><p>铎丝不确定地耸了耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych whistled and said in a failing attempt to sound unimpressed, "Hey, look at that fancy place."</p><p>芮奇吹着口哨，试图（却没有成功）以毫不动容的口气说：“嘿，看看那个拉风的地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sergeant Thalus gestured to Seldon clearly indicating that he was to follow. Seldon hung back and, also relying on the universal language of gesture, held out both arms, clearly including Dors and Raych. </p><p>塔勒斯中士对谢顿做了一个手势，显然是要他跟着走。谢顿却裹足不前，他伸出双臂，同样借着这种宇宙通用的语言，表示应将铎丝与芮奇包括在内。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant hesitated in a slightly hangdog fashion at the impressive pink doorway. His mustache almost seemed to droop.</p><p>在壮观的粉红色大门口，中士有点卑微地迟疑了一下，他的两撇胡子好像也垂了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then he said gruffly, "All three of you, then. My word of honor holds……Still, others may not feel obligated by my own obligation, you know."</p><p>然后他板着脸说：“那么，你们三个一起来吧，我的荣誉担保仍然算数。话说回来，你该明白，其他人也许并不认同我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded. "I hold you responsible for your own deeds only, Sergeant."</p><p>谢顿点了点头。“中士，我坚信你只对自己的行为负责。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sergeant was clearly moved and, for a moment, his face lightened as though he was considering the possibility of shaking Seldons hand or expressing heartfelt his approval in some other way. He decided against it, however, and stepped onto the bottom step of the flight that led to the door. The stairs immediately began a stately upward movement.</p><p>中士显然感动万分，一时之间，他的脸孔开朗许多，仿佛他在考虑是否有可能和谢顿握握手，或是以其他方式表达他的衷心赞同。然而，他终究否决了这些冲动，径自走向门前的台阶。他才踏上第一级，那道阶梯立刻开始庄严地缓缓上升。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon and Dors stepped after him at once and kept their balance without much trouble. Raych, who was momentarily staggered in surprise, jumped onto the moving stairs after a short run, shoved both hands into his pockets, and whistled carelessly.</p><p>谢顿与铎丝赶紧随着他踏上阶梯，没费多大力气便稳住身形。芮奇惊讶之余曾有短暂的踌躇，经过短距离冲刺才跳上这个活动阶梯。他随即将双手插进口袋，悠闲地吹起口哨。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The door opened and two women stepped out, one on either side in symmetrical fashion. They were young and attractive. Their dresses, belted tightly about the waist and reaching nearly to their ankles, fell in crisp pleats and rustled when they walked. Both had brown hair that was coiled in thick plaits on either side of their heads. (Seldon found it attractive, but wondered how long it took them each morning to arrange it just so. He had not been aware of so elaborate a coiffure on the women they had passed in the streets.) </p><p>大门打开后，出现两名既年轻又迷人的女子，以对称的方式一左一右走出来。她们的衣裳在腰际由皮带紧紧系住，下摆几乎长达脚踝，末端有波浪状的褶子，走路时会沙沙作响。两人都有一头棕发，在头部两侧结成两条粗辫再盘起来。谢顿发觉那很吸引人，却又纳闷她们每天早上得花多少时间梳理。刚才一路上，他并未发觉街上的妇女拥有如此精致的发型。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The two women stared at the newcomers with obvious contempt. Seldon was not surprised. After the days events, he and Dors looked almost as disreputable as Raych.</p><p>两名女子以明显的轻蔑眼神凝视来客。这点谢顿并不惊讶，经过一天的折腾，他与铎丝看来几乎和芮奇一样灰头土脸。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yet the women managed to bow decorously and then made a half-turn and gestured inward in perfect unison and with symmetry carefully maintained. (Did they rehearse these things?) It was clear that the three were to enter. </p><p>然而，两名女子还是优雅地鞠了一躬，然后半转过身，以完全一致的动作做个请进的手势，并仔细维持着彼此的对称。（她们预演过吗？）显然是要他们三人进去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They stepped through an elaborate room, cluttered with furniture and decorative items whose use Seldon did not readily understand. The floor was light-colored, springy, and glowed with luminescence. Seldon noted with some embarrassment that their footwear left dusty marks upon it.</p><p>他们穿过一个精致的房间，房里零星散布着许多家具与装饰品，谢顿无法一眼看出它们的功用。地板是淡色系的，富有弹性并发出冷光。谢顿注意到他们的鞋子在上面留下不少灰尘，令他感到有些不好意思。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then an inner door was flung open and yet another woman emerged. She was distinctly older than the first two (who sank slowly as she came in, crossing their legs symmetrically as they did so in a way that made Seldon marvel that they could keep their balance; it undoubtedly took a deal of practice). </p><p>然后，内门突然被推开了，随即出现另一名女子，她比先前那两位无疑年长许多。当她走进来时，两名少女双脚交错，缓缓低下身子。谢顿不禁赞叹她们竟然能保持平衡，这无疑需要大量的练习。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon wondered if he too was expected to display some ritualized form of respect, but since he hadn't the faintest notion of what this might consist of, he merely bowed his head slightly. Dors remained standing erect and, it seemed to Seldon, did so with disdain. Raych was staring open-mouthed in all directions and looked as though he didn't even see the woman who had just entered. </p><p>谢顿不知道自己是否也该做出某种仪式化的敬拜，但既然对这一切毫无概念，他只是微微低下头来。铎丝则保持直立的姿势，在谢顿的感觉中，她的动作似乎带着不屑的意味。芮奇则正在张大嘴巴东张西望，好像根本没看到刚进来的那名女子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was plump……not fat, but comfortably padded. She wore her hair precisely as the young ladies did and her dress was in the same style, but much more richly ornamented……too much so to suit Seldons aesthetic notions. </p><p>她的体型丰满……并非肥胖，但有适度的脂肪。她将头发梳成和两名少女一样的发型，而她的衣裳也是同一种款式，不过装饰却华丽许多倍……实在太多了点，令谢顿的审美观无法接受。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was clearly middle-aged and there was a hint of gray in her hair, but the dimples in her cheeks gave her the appearance of having rather more than a dash of youth. Her light brown eyes were merry and on the whole she looked more motherly than old.</p><p>她显然已步入中年，她的头发透出些许灰白，但双颊上的酒涡为她的外表带来不少青春气息。此外，她淡褐色的眼睛喜气洋洋。整体而言，她看来不算老，反而更像一位慈母。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, "How are you? All of you." (She showed no surprise at the presence of Dors and Raych, but included them easily in her greeting.) "Ive been waiting for you for some time and almost had you on Upperside at Streeling. You are Dr. Hari Seldon, whom Ive been looking forward to meeting. You, I think, must be Dr. Dors Venabili, for you had been reported to be in his company. This young man I fear I do not know, but I am pleased to see him. But we must not spend our time talking, for Im sure you would like to rest first."</p><p>她说：“你们大家好吗？”她并未对铎丝与芮奇表现出惊讶，反倒在问候中轻易将他们包括在内。“我等待你已有一些时日，当初在斯璀璘的上方，差点就请到你了。你是哈里·谢顿博士，是我一直期待会见的人。而你，我想一定是铎丝·凡纳比里博士，因为根据报告，你一直都在他身边。这个年轻人我恐怕不认识，不过我很高兴见到他。但我们绝不该花太多时间交谈，我确定你们会希望先休息一下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And bathe, Madam," said Dors rather forcefully, "Each of us could use a thorough shower."</p><p>“还有沐浴，女士，”铎丝以颇为有力的口气说，“我们每个人都得好好洗个澡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, certainly," said the woman, "and a change in clothing. Especially the young man." She looked down at Raych without any of the look of contempt and disapproval that the two young women had shown. </p><p>“是的，当然。”那女子说，“还要换一套衣服，尤其是这个年轻人。”她低头望向芮奇，和那两名少女不同的是，她脸上没有任何轻视或不以为然的表情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, "What is your name, young man?"</p><p>她说：“年轻人，你叫什么名字？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Raych," said Raych in a rather choked and embarrassed voice. He then added experimentally, "Missus."</p><p>“芮奇。”芮奇以有些哽塞与尴尬的声音说，接着又试探性地补充道，“姑奶奶好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What an odd coincidence," said the woman, her eyes sparkling. "An omen, perhaps. My own name is Rashelle. isn't  that odd?……But come. We shall take care of you all. Then there will be plenty of time to have dinner and to talk."</p><p>“多么奇妙的巧合，”那女子的双眼闪烁着光芒，“或许是个兆头。我的名字叫芮喜尔，这是不是很奇妙？不过别管这个了，我们会好好照顾你们。然后，我们有充分的时间来餐叙。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wait, Madam," said Dors. "May I ask where we are?"</p><p>“女士，等一等。”铎丝说，“我能请问我们在哪里吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wye, dear. And please call me Rashelle, as you come to feel more friendly. I am always at ease with informality."</p><p>“卫荷，亲爱的。等你觉得更熟络时，就请改口叫我芮喜尔吧。我总是喜欢不拘礼节。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors stiffened. "Are you surprised that we ask? isn't  it natural that we should want to know where we are?"</p><p>铎丝的态度转趋强硬。“我们的问题令你惊讶吗？我们想知道身在何处，难道不是很自然吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle laughed in a pleasant, tinkling manner. "Really, Dr. Venabili, something must be done about the name of this place. I was not asking a question but making a statement. You asked where you were and I did not ask you why. I told you, Wye. You are in the Wye Sector."</p><p>芮喜尔发出一阵愉悦而清脆的笑声。“真的，凡纳比里博士，这地方的名字好歹也得改一改。我刚刚并非提出一个问题，而是在做一项陈述。你问你们在哪里，我不是反问你‘为何’，而是回答你‘卫荷’。你们如今在卫荷区。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In Wye?" said Seldon forcibly.</p><p>“在卫荷？”谢顿强而有力地问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes indeed, Dr. Seldon. Weve wanted you from the day you addressed the Decennial Convention and we are so glad to have you now."</p><p>“的确没错，谢顿博士。打从你在十载会议上发表演说那天起，我们就想把你请来，我们很高兴现在终于请到你了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Actually, it took a full day to rest and unstiffen, to wash and get clean, to obtain new clothes (satiny and rather loose, in the style of Wye), and to sleep a good deal.</p><p>事实上，休息，放松，把全身洗干净，换上新衣服（质料光滑且有些宽松，这是卫荷服装的特色），再好好睡上一觉，花了他们一整天的时间。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was during the second evening in Wye that there was the dinner that Madam Rashelle had promised.</p><p>来到卫荷的第二天傍晚，芮喜尔女士承诺的晚餐才有机会举行。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The table was a large one……too large, considering that there were only four dining: Hari Seldon, Dors Venabili, Raych, and Rashelle. The walls and ceiling were softly illuminated and the colors changed at a rate that caught the eye but not so rapidly as in any way to discommode the mind. The very tablecloth, which was not cloth (Seldon had not made up his mind what it might be), seemed to sparkle.</p><p>餐桌相当大……其实太大了，因为总共只有四个人进餐：哈里·谢顿、铎丝·凡纳比里、芮奇与芮喜尔。墙壁与天花板都打上柔和的灯光，光线的色彩不停变化，其速率足以吸引目光，却不至于快到令人心浮气躁。而桌布（其实并非布料，谢顿心中尚未判定它是什么）似乎会闪闪发光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The servers were many and silent and when the door opened it seemed to Seldon that he caught a glimpse of soldiers, armed and at the ready, outside. The room was a velvet glove, but the iron fist was not far distant. </p><p>服侍进餐的仆人很多，个个沉默不语。当门打开的时候，谢顿似乎瞥见外面站着一些士兵，一律全副武装并荷枪实弹。这个房间像个天鹅绒手套，而那只铁拳却在不远的地方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle was gracious and friendly and had clearly taken a particular liking to Raych, who, she insisted, was to sit next to her. </p><p>芮喜尔表现得殷勤而亲切，而且显然对芮奇特别喜爱，还坚持要他坐在她旁边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych……scrubbed, polished, and shining, all but unrecognizable in his new clothes, with his hair clipped, cleaned, and brushed……scarcely dared to say a word. It was as though he felt his grammar no longer fit his appearance. He was pitifully ill at ease and he watched Dors carefully as she switched from utensil to utensil, trying to match her exactly in every respect. </p><p>芮奇已经彻底洗个干净，显得焕然一新。在他穿上新衣服，而且头发经过修剪、清洗、梳理之后，几乎使人认不出来了。现在他简直不敢开口说话，仿佛感到他的文法不再符合自己的外表。他觉得万分不自在，每当铎丝更换餐具时，他都会仔细望着她，试着百分之百模仿她的动作。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The food was tasty but spicy……to the point where Seldon could not recognize the exact nature of the dishes.</p><p>食物可口但味道过重，以致谢顿无法分辨一道道菜究竟是什么做的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle, her plump face made happy by her gentle smile and her fine teeth gleaming white, said, "You may think we have Mycogenian additives in the food, but we do not. It is all homegrown in Wye. There is no sector on the planet more self-sufficient than Wye. We labor hard to keep that so."</p><p>芮喜尔带着温柔的微笑，令她丰满的脸颊显得很开心，而她美丽的牙齿则闪着雪白的晶光。“你也许以为我们在食物中放了麦曲生添加物，其实并没有，这些全是卫荷自家种植的。在这颗行星上，没有任何一区比卫荷更自给自足。我们花费很大心力保持如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded gravely and said, "Everything you have given us is first-rate, Rashelle. We are much obliged to you."</p><p>谢顿严肃地点了点头。“你招待我们的每样东西都是一流的，芮喜尔，我们十分感谢你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And yet within himself he thought the food was not quite up to Mycogenian standards and he felt moreover, as he had earlier muttered to Dors, that he was celebrating his own defeat. Or Hummins defeat, at any rate, and that seemed to him to be the same thing.</p><p>但他在心中，却认为这些食物还是比不上麦曲生的水准。他更有一种感觉，正如他早先对铎丝嘀咕的，他正在庆祝自己的失败。或者至少是夫铭的失败，而在他看来，两者似乎是同一回事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After all, he had been captured by Wye, the very possibility that had so concerned Hummin at the time of the incident Upperside. </p><p>到头来，他还是被卫荷逮到了。当初，在上方事件发生后，夫铭曾经非常担心这个可能性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle said, "Perhaps, in my role as hostess, I may be forgiven if I ask personal questions. Am I correct in assuming that you three do not represent a family; that you, Hari, and you, Dors, are not married and that Raych is not your son?"</p><p>芮喜尔说：“我既然身为女主人，或许问些私人问题也值得原谅。我猜你们三位不是一家人；你，哈里，和你，铎丝，并不是夫妻，而芮奇也不是你们的儿子。这个猜测是否正确？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The three of us are not related in any way," said Seldon. "Raych was born on Trantor, I on Helicon, Dors on Cinna."</p><p>“我们三个人并没有任何关系。”谢顿说，“芮奇生在川陀，我生在赫利肯，铎丝生在锡纳。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And how did you all meet, then?"</p><p>“那么，你们三人是怎样遇到的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon explained briefly and with as little detail as he could manage. "Theres nothing romantic or significant in the meetings," he added.</p><p>谢顿做了简短的解释，尽可能避免提到任何细节。“过程中没有任何浪漫或重要的情节。”他补充道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yet I am given to understand that you raised difficulties with my personal aide, Sergeant Thalus, when he wanted to take only you out of Dahl."</p><p>“但据我了解，当我的贴身侍卫塔勒斯中士只要将你一人带离达尔时，你曾对他百般刁难。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said gravely, "I had grown fond of Dors and Raych and did not wish to be separated from them."</p><p>谢顿以严肃的口吻说：“我越来越喜欢铎丝和芮奇，不希望和他们分开。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle smiled and said, "You are a sentimental man, I see."</p><p>芮喜尔微微一笑。“我懂了，你是个感情丰富的男人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I am. Sentimental. And puzzled too."</p><p>“是的，没错。我感情丰富，而且十分困惑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Puzzled?"</p><p>“困惑？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why yes. And since you were so kind as to ask personal questions of us, may I ask one as well?"</p><p>“可不是吗。既然你这么亲切，问了我们一些私人问题，我能否也问一个？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course, my dear Hari. Ask anything you please."</p><p>“当然，亲爱的哈里，你喜欢问什么都行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"When we first arrived, you said that Wye has wanted me from the day I addressed the Decennial Convention. For what reason might that be?"</p><p>“我们刚到的时候，你说打从我在十载会议上发表演说那天起，卫荷就想要把我请来。是什么原因呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely, you are not so simple as not to know. We want you for your psychohistory."</p><p>“不用说，你不会单纯到连这点都不明白。我们要你，是为了你的心理史学。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That much I do understand. But what makes you think that having me means you have psychohistory?"</p><p>“这点我还算了解。可是你怎么会认为，得到我就代表得到心理史学？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely, you have not been so careless as to lose it."</p><p>“不用说，你不会粗心到把它给弄丢了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Worse, Rashelle. I have never had it."</p><p>“事实上更糟，芮喜尔，我从未拥有这门学问。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelles face dimpled. "But you said you had it in your talk. Not that I understood your talk. I am not a mathematician. I hate numbers. But I have in my employ mathematicians who have explained to me what it is you said."</p><p>芮喜尔脸上现出酒涡。“但你在演说中却不是这么讲。并非我听得懂你的演说，我不是数学家，我甚至痛恨数字。可是我雇用了不少数学家，他们对我解释过你的演说内容。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, my dear Rashelle, you must listen more closely. I can well imagine they have told you that I have proven that psychohistorical predictions are conceivable, but surely they must also have told you that they are not practical."</p><p>“这样的话，亲爱的芮喜尔，你必须听得更仔细些。我绝对能想象他们曾经告诉你，说我证明出心理史学的预测是可能的，但他们想必也告诉过你，那实际上是不可行的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I cant believe that, Hari. The very next day, you were called into an audience with that pseudo-Emperor, Cleon."</p><p>“哈里，这点我无法相信。第二天你就进宫，去觐见那个伪皇帝，克里昂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The pseudo-Emperor?" murmured Dors ironically.</p><p>“伪皇帝？”铎丝以讽刺的口吻咕哝道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why yes," said Rashelle as though she was answering a serious question. "Pseudo-Emperor. He has no true claim to the throne."</p><p>“可不是吗。”芮喜尔仿佛在回答一个严肃的问题，“伪皇帝，他没有接掌皇位的真正资格。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Rashelle," said Seldon, brushing that aside a bit impatiently, "I told Cleon exactly what I have just told you and he let me go."</p><p>“芮喜尔，”谢顿有点不耐烦地把那个问题推到一边，“我告诉克里昂的答案，和我刚才对你说的一模一样，然后他就让我走了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now Rashelle did nor smile. A small edge crept into her voice. "Yes, he let you go the way the cat in the fable lets a mouse go. He has been pursuing you ever since……in Streeling, in Mycogen, in Dahl. He would pursue you here if he dared. But come now……our serious talk is too serious. Let us enjoy ourselves. Let us have music."</p><p>这回芮喜尔并未露出笑容，她的声音则变得有点尖锐。“没错，他让你走了，以寓言中猫放老鼠走的那种方式。从此以后，他就一直在追捕你……在斯璀璘，在麦曲生，在达尔。要是有胆的话，他还会追到这里来。不过到此为止吧……我们的严肃话题变得太过严肃了。让我们享受一下，让我们来点音乐。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And at her words, there suddenly sounded a soft but joyous instrumental melody. She leaned toward Raych and said softly, "My boy, if you are not at ease with the fork, use your spoon or your fingers. I wont mind."</p><p>她说完后，轻柔悦耳的乐器旋律便突然响起。她凑向芮奇，轻声说道：“孩子，如果你不习惯用叉子，用汤匙或手指都行，我不会介意的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "Yes, mum," and swallowed hard, but Dors caught his eye and her lips silently mouthed: "Fork."</p><p>芮奇说：“好的，女士。”显然是毫不保留地接受了。但铎丝却捕捉到他的目光，并做出一组无声的嘴型：“叉子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He remained with his fork.</p><p>于是他并未将叉子丢开。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "The music is lovely, Madam"……she pointedly rejected the familiar form of address "but it must not he allowed to distract us. There is the thought in my mind that the pursuer in all those places might have been in the employ of the Wye Sector. Surely, you would not be so well acquainted with events if Wye were not the prime mover."</p><p>铎丝说：“女士，这音乐真可爱。”她刻意拒绝用亲昵的称呼，“可是绝不能让它使我们分心。我心里有个想法，就是各处的追捕者可能都受雇于卫荷区。不用说，假如卫荷不是主谋，你也不会对那些事了若指掌。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle laughed aloud. "Wye has its eyes and ears everywhere, of course, but we were not the pursuers. Had we been, you would have been picked up without fail……as you were in Dahl finally when, indeed, we were the pursuers. When, however, there is a pursuit that fails, a grasping hand that misses, you may be sure that it is Demerzel."</p><p>芮喜尔纵声大笑。“卫荷的耳目自然遍布各个角落，但所谓的追捕者并不是我们。否则，你们早就被一举捉来了……就像你们在达尔那样，这一次，我们终于真正成为追捕者。然而，当追捕的行动失败，当伸出的爪子抓空时，便可确定那是丹莫刺尔主使的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you think so little of Demerzel?" murmured Dors.</p><p>“你如此看轻丹莫刺尔吗？”铎丝喃喃问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Does that surprise you? We have beaten him."</p><p>“是的。这令你惊讶吗？我们已经击败他了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You? Or the Wye Sector?"</p><p>“你？或是卫荷区？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The sector, of course, but insofar as Wye is the victor, then I am the victor."</p><p>“当然是本区，但只要卫荷是胜利者，那么我就是胜利者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How strange," said Dors. "There seems to be a prevalent opinion throughout Trantor that the inhabitants of Wye have nothing to do with victory, with defeat, or with anything else. It is felt that there is but one will and one fist in Wye and that is that of the Mayor. Surely, you……or any other Wyan……weigh nothing in comparison."</p><p>“多奇怪啊。”铎丝说，“整个川陀似乎盛行着一种见解，那就是无论胜利或败北，或是其他任何事情，都和卫荷居民毫无关系。在我们的感觉中，卫荷只有一个意志，一只拳头，而那是属于区长所有。不用说，你，或者其他卫荷人，相较之下都无足轻重。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle smiled broadly. She paused to look at Raych benevolently and to pinch his cheek, then said, "If you believe that our Mayor is an autocrat and that there is but one will that sways Wye, then perhaps you are right. But, even so, I can still use the personal pronoun, for my will is of account."</p><p>芮喜尔露出灿烂的笑容。她并未立即回答，而是以慈祥的眼神望着芮奇，又掐掐他的脸颊，这才说道：“如果你相信我们的区长是个独裁者，只有一个意志支配着卫荷，那么或许你是对的。可是，即使如此，我仍然可以用人称代词，因为我的意志举足轻重。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why yours?" said Seldon.</p><p>“为什么？”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?" said Rashelle as the servers began clearing the table. "I am the Mayor of Wye."</p><p>“有何不可？”当仆人开始收拾餐桌时，芮喜尔说，“我，就是卫荷区长。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was Raych who was the first to react to the statement. Quite forgetting the cloak of civility that sat upon him so uncomfortably, he laughed raucously and said, "Hey, lady, ya cant be Mayor. Mayors is guys."</p><p>对这项陈述首先做出反应的是芮奇。他几乎忘了强行加诸其上的斯文外衣，先发出一阵刺耳的笑声，接着说道：“嘿，大姐，你不可能是区长，区长都是哥儿们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle looked at him good-naturedly and said in a perfect imitation of his tone of voice, "Hey, kid, some Mayors is guys and some Mayors is dames. Put that under your lid and let it bubble."</p><p>芮喜尔和蔼地望着他，十足模仿他的腔调说：“嘿，小子，有些区长是哥儿们，有些区长是娘儿们。把这件事放在脑袋瓜里，让它好好煮一煮。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raychs eyes protruded and he seemed stunned. Finally he managed to say, "Hey, ya talk regular, lady."</p><p>芮奇双眼鼓起来，似乎吓了一大跳。最后，他总算吐出一句：“嘿，大姐，你在说平常话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure thing. Regular as ya want," said Rashelle, still smiling.</p><p>“是呀，要多平常就多平常。”芮喜尔仍然面带笑容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon cleared his throat and said, "Thats quite an accent you have, Rashelle."</p><p>谢顿清了清喉咙，说道：“芮喜尔，你学的口音可真像。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle tossed her head slightly. "I haven't had occasion to use it in many years, but one never forgets. I once had a friend, a good friend, who was a Dahlite……when I was very young." She sighed. "He didn't speak that way, of course……he was quite intelligent……but he could do so if he wished and he taught me. It was exciting to talk so with him. It created a world that excluded our surroundings. It was wonderful. It was also impossible. My father made that plain. And now along comes this young rascal, Raych, to remind me of those long-ago days. He has the accent, the eyes, the impudent cast of countenance, and in six years or so he will be a delight and terror to the young women. Wont you, Raych?"</p><p>芮喜尔稍稍抬起头。“许多年来，我一直没机会用，但我永远不会忘记。我曾经有个朋友，一个好朋友，他是个达尔人……那是我非常年轻的时候。”她叹了一声，“当然，他并不像那样讲话……他相当聪明能干……但他可以讲那种话，而且把我也教会了。跟他那样说话实在令人兴奋，等于创造了一个世界，把周遭的一切都排除在外。那实在太美妙了，却也是一件不可能的事，因为家父的立场十分明白。如今来了这个小淘气，芮奇，不禁使我想起那段遥远的时光。他有那种口音，那种眼神，那种叛逆的表情，差不多再过六年，他就会成为少女心目中又爱又怕的对象。会不会，芮奇？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "I dunno, lady……uh, mum."</p><p>芮奇说：“我不知，大姐……不，女士。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im sure you will and you will come to look very much like my……old friend and it will be much more comfortable for me not to see you then. And now, dinners over and its time for you to go to your room, Raych. You can watch holovision for a while if you wish. I don't suppose you read."</p><p>“我确定你会的，而且你会变得非常像我的……那位老朋友。那个时候，为了我自己着想，我最好别再见到你。现在晚餐已经结束，芮奇，你该回到自己的房间去了。如果有兴趣，你可以看一会儿全息电视。我猜你不会读书。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych reddened. "Im gonna read someday. Master Seldon says Im gonna."</p><p>芮奇涨红了脸。“总有一天我会读，谢顿老爷说的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then Im sure you will."</p><p>“那么我也相信你一定会。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A young woman approached Raych, curtsying respectfully in Rashelles direction.</p><p>一名年轻女子向芮奇走来，并朝芮喜尔的方向尊敬地屈膝行礼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon had not seen the signal that had summoned her.</p><p>谢顿并未注意到召唤她的讯号。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "Cant I stay with Master Seldon and Missus Venabili?"</p><p>芮奇说：“我不能留下来，陪谢顿老爷和凡纳比里姑奶奶吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Youll see them later," said Rashelle gently, "but Master and Missus and I have to talk right now……so you must go."</p><p>“等一下你就会见到他们，”芮喜尔温柔地说，“可是现在我和老爷以及姑奶奶得谈一谈……所以你必须离开。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors mouthed a firm "Go!" at Raych and with a grimace the boy slid out of his chair and followed the attendant.</p><p>铎丝对芮奇做了一个坚决的嘴型：“走！”男孩回应了一个鬼脸，随即滑下椅子，跟着那名女仆走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle turned to Seldon and Dors once Raych was gone and said, "The boy will be safe, of course, and treated well. Please have no fears about that. And I will be safe too. As my woman approached just now, so will a dozen armed men……and much more rapidly……when summoned. I want you to understand that."</p><p>芮奇离去后，芮喜尔随即转向谢顿与铎丝，说道：“那孩子当然会很安全，而且会受到良好待遇，这点请别担心。而我自己也会很安全，正如女侍刚才走过来那样，在我召唤之下，十几名武装卫士也能随传随到……而且动作快得多。我要你们了解这一点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said evenly, "We are in no way thinking of attacking you, Rashelle……or must I now say, Madam Mayor?"</p><p>谢顿以平稳的语气说：“我们绝对没有想要攻击你，芮喜尔……或是我现在得说‘区长女士’？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Still Rashelle. I am given to understand that you are a wrestler of sorts, Hari, and you, Dors, are very skillful with the knives we have removed from your room. I don't want you to rely uselessly on your skills, since I want Hari alive, unharmed, and friendly."</p><p>“还是叫芮喜尔吧。据我所知，哈里，你可算一名摔跤选手；而你，铎丝，双刀耍得非常熟练，不过我们已经从你的房间取走那两把刀。我不要你们妄想仰赖你们的本领，因为我要哈里活着，毫发无损，而且态度友善。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is quite well understood, Madam Mayor," said Dors, her lack of friendship uncompromised, "that the ruler of Wye, now and for the past forty years, is Mannix, Fourth of that Name, and that he is still alive and in full possession of his faculties. Who, then, are you really?"</p><p>“有一点大家十分了解，区长女士，”铎丝毫无妥协地拒绝表现友善的态度，“过去四十年来，直到今天为止，卫荷的统治者都是曼尼克斯四世。他仍旧健在，而且神志完全清醒。所以说，你究竟是什么人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly who I say I am, Dors. Mannix IV is my father. He is, as you say, still alive and in possession of his faculties. In the eyes of the Emperor and of all the Empire, he is Mayor of Wye, but he is weary of the strains of power and is willing, at last, to let them slip into my hands, which are just as willing to receive them. I am his only child and I was brought up all my life to rule. My father is therefore Mayor in law and name, but I am Mayor in fact. It is to me, now, that the armed forces of Wye have sworn allegiance and in Wye that is all that counts."</p><p>“正如我所做的自我介绍，铎丝。曼尼克斯四世是我父亲，正如你所说，他仍旧健在，而且神志清醒。在皇帝以及整个帝国眼中，他才是卫荷的区长，但他厌倦了为权力而心力交瘁，终于心甘情愿地让权力溜到我手中，而我同样心甘情愿地接收。我是他的独生女，从小被教养成一名统治者。因此，家父是法律上与名义上的区长，而我则是实际上的区长。如今，卫荷军队宣誓效忠的对象是我。而在卫荷，这才是真正算数的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded. "Let it be as you say. But even so, whether it is Mayor Mannix IV or Mayor Rashelle I……it is the First, I suppose……there is no purpose in your holding me. I have told you that I don't have a workable psychohistory and I do not think that either I or anyone else will ever have one. I have told that to the Emperor. I am of no use either to you or to him."</p><p>谢顿点了点头。“姑且接受你所说的一切。但即使如此，不管区长是曼尼克斯四世或芮喜尔一世……我想是一世吧……你们留置我都没有任何意义。我已经告诉你，我并未掌握一个可行的心理史学，也不认为我自己或其他人将来能掌握到。我也曾经对大帝这样说过，所以我对你和对他同样没用。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle said, "How naive you are. Do you know the history of the Empire?"</p><p>芮喜尔说：“你多么天真啊。你可知道帝国的历史？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "I have recently come to wish that I knew it much better."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“最近我才希望自己多知道些。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said dryly, "I know Imperial history quite well, though the pre-Imperial age is my specialty, Madam Mayor. But what does it matter whether we do or do not?"</p><p>铎丝以冷淡的口气说：“区长女士，我则对帝国历史相当了解，虽然前帝国时代才是我的专长。但我们究竟是否了解，又有什么关系呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you know your history, you know that the House of Wye is ancient and honorable and is descended from the Dacian dynasty."</p><p>“你如果知道这些历史，就该知道卫荷世族是个古老而光荣的家族，而且是达斯皇朝的后裔。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "The Dacians ruled five thousand years ago. The number of their descendants in the hundred and fifty generations that have lived and died since then may number half the population of the Galaxy……if all genealogical claims, however outrageous, are accepted."</p><p>铎丝说：“达斯皇朝的统治是五千年前的事。从那时候算起，过去一百五十代以来，他们的后人生生死死，加起来或许高达当今银河人口数的一半……只要所有的宗谱，不论多么荒诞不经，全都计算在内的话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Our genealogical claims, Dr. Venabili"……Rashelles tone of voice was, for the first time, cold and unfriendly and her eyes flashed like steel……"are not outrageous. They are fully documented. The House of Wye has maintained itself consistently in positions of power through all those generations and there have been occasions when we have held the Imperial throne and have ruled as Emperors."</p><p>“凡纳比里博士，我们的宗谱绝非荒诞不经。”芮喜尔的语调首次变得冰冷而不友善，她的双眼则像精钢一般闪烁。“它有完整的档案可供查证。在这一百五十个世代里，卫荷世族一贯保有掌权的地位，而且曾有一些时期，我们的确掌握皇位，以皇帝的名义统治帝国。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The history book-films," said Dors, "usually refer to the Wye rulers as anti-Emperors, never recognized by the bulk of the Empire."</p><p>“在历史影视书中，”铎丝说，“卫荷的统治者通常被称为‘伪皇帝’，向来不被帝国大多数地区承认。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It depends on who writes the history book-films. In the future, we will, for the throne which has been ours will be ours again."</p><p>“那要看由谁来撰写历史影视书。将来会改由我们执笔，因为我们的皇位终将失而复得。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To accomplish that, you must bring about civil war."</p><p>“想要达到这个目的，你必须发动一场内战。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There wont be much risk of that," said Rashelle. She was smiling again. "That is what I must explain to you because I want Dr. Seldons help in preventing such a catastrophe. My father, Mannix IV, has been a man of peace all his life. He has been loyal to whomever it might be that ruled in the Imperial Palace and he has kept Wye a prosperous and strong pillar of the Trantorian economy for the good of all the Empire."</p><p>“不会有太大的风险。”芮喜尔再度露出笑容，“这就是我必须向你们解释的，因为我需要谢顿博士的帮助，来避免这样的一场大祸。我的父亲，曼尼克斯四世，一生都是一位和平主义者。不论什么人住在皇宫里，他都一律效忠不误。而且为了整个帝国的利益，他始终保持卫荷的繁荣和强盛，成为川陀经济的重要支柱。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know that the Emperor has ever trusted him any the more for all that," said Dors.</p><p>“我没听说皇帝因此而更加信任他。”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im sure that is so," said Rashelle calmly, "for the Emperors that have occupied the Palace in my fathers time have known themselves to be usurpers of a usurping line. Usurpers cannot afford to trust the true rulers. And yet my father has kept the peace. He has, of course, developed and trained a magnificent security force to maintain the peace, prosperity, and stability of the sector and the Imperial authorities have allowed this because they wanted Wye peaceful, prosperous, stable……and loyal."</p><p>“我确定这点没错，”芮喜尔平静地说，“因为在家父的时代，占领皇宫的皇帝都自知是代代相传的篡位者。篡位者自然不敢信任真正的统治者。可是，家父一直以和为贵。当然，他建立并训练了一支强大的维安武力，用以维系本区的和平、繁荣和稳定。帝国当局一向默许这件事，因为他们也想要卫荷保持和平、繁荣、稳定……以及忠诚。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But is it loyal?" said Dors.</p><p>“可是它忠诚吗？”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To the true Emperor, of course," said Rashelle, "and we have now reached the stage where our strength is such that we can take over the government quickly……in a lightning stroke, in fact……and before one can say civil war there will be a true Emperor……or Empress, if you prefer……and Trantor will be as peaceful as before."</p><p>“对真正的皇帝，当然忠诚。”芮喜尔说，“现在我们的实力已经成熟，我们已经能迅速接收政府……事实上，是藉由迅雷不及掩耳的一击。在任何人能说这是‘内战’之前，就会出现一位真正的皇帝……或说女皇，如果你喜欢吹毛求疵……而川陀将保有和过去一样的太平。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors shook her head. "May I enlighten you? As a historian?"</p><p>铎丝摇了摇头。“我能开导你一下吗？以历史学家的身份？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am always willing to listen." And she inclined her head ever so slightly toward Dors.</p><p>“我一向乐意受教。”她朝铎丝的方向稍稍凑过头去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whatever size your security force may be, however well-trained and well-equipped, they cannot possibly equal in size and strength the Imperial forces backed by twenty-five million worlds."</p><p>“不论你的维安武力规模多大，不论训练如何扎实，装备如何精良，帝国武力却有两千五百万个世界做后盾，你们绝对不是对手。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah, but you have put your finger on the usurpers weakness, Dr. Venabili. There are twenty-five million worlds, with the Imperial forces scattered over them. Those forces are thinned out over incalculable space, under uncounted officers, none of them particularly ready for any action outside their own Provinces, many ready for action in their own interest rather than in the Empires. Our forces, on the other hand, are all here, all on Trantor. We can act and conclude before the distant generals and admirals can get it through their heads that they are needed."</p><p>“啊，但你刚好指出了篡位者的弱点，凡纳比里博士。帝国武力分散于两千五百万个世界；在无尽的太空中，在无数的军官统率下，那些兵力已被稀释殆尽。没有人特别愿意出兵自身星省之外，反而许多都不顾帝国死活，只愿意为自己的利益而战。反之，我们的部队都在此地，全部在川陀。在远方的将领风闻需要他们发兵驰援之前，我们便能迅速采取行动并完成任务。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But that response will come……and with irresistible force."</p><p>“可是反应必将随之而至，带着无可抵御的武力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you certain of that?" said Rashelle. "We will be in the Palace. Trantor will be ours and at peace. Why should the Imperial forces stir when, by minding their own business, each petty military leader can have his own world to rule, his own Province?"</p><p>“你确定会吗？”芮喜尔说，“那时我们将坐镇皇宫，川陀已是我们的，而且处于太平状态。帝国军队如果只管自己的事，那么每个小小的军事领袖都能统治自己的世界、自己的星省，所以说，他们为什么要来搅和？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But is that what you want?" asked Seldon wonderingly. "Are you telling me that you look forward to ruling over an Empire that will break up into splinters?"</p><p>“难道那就是你想要的吗？”谢顿好奇地问道，“你是在告诉我，你期望统治一个即将四分五裂的帝国？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle said, "That is exactly right. I would rule over Trantor, over its outlying space settlements, over the few nearby planetary systems that are part of the Trantorian Province. I would much rather be Emperor of Trantor than Emperor of the Galaxy."</p><p>芮喜尔说：“正是如此。我将统治川陀，统治它外围的太空殖民地，统治邻近几个属于川陀星省的行星系。我将更像川陀的皇帝，而不是整个银河的皇帝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You would be satisfied with Trantor only," said Dors in tones of the deepest disbelief.</p><p>“你会满足于仅仅拥有川陀？”铎丝以绝不相信的口吻说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?" said Rashelle, suddenly ablaze. She leaned forward eagerly, both hands pressed palms-down on the table. "That is what my father has been planning for forty years. He is only clinging to life now to witness its fulfillment. Why do we need millions of worlds, distant worlds that mean nothing to us, that weaken us, that draw our forces far away from us into meaningless cubic parsecs of space, that drown us in administrative chaos, that ruin us with their endless quarrels and problems when they are all distant nothings as far as we are concerned? Our own populous world……our own planetary city……is Galaxy enough for us. We have all we need to support ourselves. As for the rest of the Galaxy, let it splinter. Every petty militarist can have his own splinter. They neednt fight. There will be enough for all."</p><p>“为何不会？”芮喜尔突然变得慷慨激昂，她急切地将身子向前倾，双手按在餐桌上。“那正是家父谋划了四十年的目标。他如今苟延残喘地活着，只为亲眼目睹它的实现。我们为什么需要千万个世界？遥远的世界对我们毫无意义，只会削弱我们的实力，只会把我们的武力从身边抽走，洒向毫无意义的太空，只会将我们淹没在行政管理的混沌中，只会以无止无休的争吵和问题把我们拖垮……其实对我们而言，它们根本等于不存在。我们自己这个人口众多的世界，我们自己这个行星都会，已足以作为我们的银河；我们拥有自给自足的一切。至于银河其他部分，就让它四分五裂吧。每个小小的军头都能拥有自己的一小片，他们无需争斗，银河足够让他们分。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But they will fight, just the same," said Dors. "Each will refuse to be satisfied with his Province. Each will feel that his neighbor is not satisfied with his Province. Each will feel insecure and will dream of Galactic rule as the only guarantee of safety. This is certain, Madam Empress of Nothing. There will be endless wars into which you and Trantor will be inevitably drawn……to the ruin of all."</p><p>“可是无论如何，他们还是会斗的。”铎丝说，“每一个都不肯满足于自己的星省，每一个都恐惧近邻不满足于他们自己的星省，每一个都感到不安全，因而都会梦想统治全银河，那才是唯一的安全保证。我的虚无女皇，这是绝对肯定的事。从此将会有无穷无尽的战争，而你和你的川陀必然会被卷进去……同归于尽。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle said with clear contempt, "So it might seem, if one could see no farther than you do, if one relied on the ordinary lessons of history."</p><p>芮喜尔以明显的轻蔑口吻说：“看来似乎如此……如果我们无法看得比你更远，如果仅仅凭借普通的历史教训。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is there to see farther?" retorted Dors. "What is one to rely on beyond the lessons of history?"</p><p>“还有什么能看得更远的？”铎丝回嘴道，“除了历史教训之外，我们还能凭借什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What lies beyond?" said Rashelle. "Why, he."</p><p>“除此之外还有什么？”芮喜尔说，“哈，还有他！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And her arm shot outward, her index finger jabbing toward Seldon.</p><p>她的手臂猛然伸出，食指戳向谢顿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Me?" said Seldon. "I have already told you that psychohistory……"</p><p>“我？”谢顿说，“我已经告诉你心理史学……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle said, "Do not repeat what you have already said, my good Dr. Seldon. We gain nothing by that……Do you think, Dr. Venabili, that my father was never aware of the danger of endless civil war? Do you think he did not bend his powerful mind to thinking of some way to prevent that? He has been prepared at any time these last ten years to take over the Empire in a day. It needed only the assurance of security beyond victory."</p><p>芮喜尔道：“别再重复你说过的话，我的谢顿博士，它对我们毫无用处。凡纳比里博士，难道你认为家父从未体认无穷内战的危险？你以为他并未倾注过人的智慧，设法想出防范之道？过去十年来，他随时准备好在一天之内接收帝国。唯一欠缺的，就是胜利之外的安全保证。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Which you cant have," said Dors.</p><p>“那是你们无法掌握的。”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Which we had the moment we heard of Dr. Seldons paper at the Decennial Convention. I saw at once that that was what we needed. My father was too old to see the significance at once. When I explained it, however, he saw it too and it was then that he formally transferred his power to me. So it is to you, Hari, that I owe my position and to you I will owe my greater position in the future."</p><p>“在听到谢顿博士于十载会议中发表论文的那一刻，我们便掌握到了。我马上看出那正是我们需要的。家父由于年事过高，无法立刻看出它的重要性。然而，在我一番解释之下，他也看出来了。那个时候，他才正式将他的权力转移给我。所以说，哈里，我的地位是拜你之赐。而在未来，我更高的地位还是要托你的福。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I keep telling you that it cannot……" began Seldon with deep annoyance.</p><p>“我一直在告诉你，它不能……”谢顿以极不耐烦的口气说了半句。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is not important what can or cannot be done. What is important is what people will or will not believe can be done. They will believe you, Hari, when you tell them the psychohistoric prediction is that Trantor can rule itself and that the Provinces can become Kingdoms that will live together in peace."</p><p>“能做或不能做什么并不重要，重要的是人民相不相信什么是做得到的。只要你告诉他们，心理史学的预测是川陀能够自我统治，每个星省都能变成一个王国，而所有的王国将和平共处，哈里，他们一定会相信的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I will make no such prediction," said Seldon, "in the absence of true psychohistory. I wont play the charlatan. If you want something like that, you say it."</p><p>“在未曾掌握真正的心理史学之前，”谢顿说，“我不会做这种预测。我不要扮演江湖术士。如果你要公布这种事，请你自己去说。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now, Hari. They wont believe me. Its you they will believe. The great mathematician. Why not oblige them?"</p><p>“算了，哈里，他们不会相信我的。他们会相信的是你，一位大数学家。何不满足他们一下呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As it happens," said Seldon "the Emperor also thought to use me as a source of self-serving prophecies. I refused to do it for him, so do you think I will agree to do it for you?"</p><p>“说来很巧，”谢顿道，“大帝也曾经想到利用我来散播一些自我实现的预言。我拒绝了他，你却以为我会同意为你这样做？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rashelle was silent for a while and when she spoke again her voice had lost its intense excitement and became almost coaxing.</p><p>芮喜尔沉默了一会儿，当她再度开口时，她的声音不再激动无比，变得几乎是好言相劝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hari," she said, "think a little of the difference between Cleon and myself. What Cleon undoubtedly wanted from you was propaganda to preserve his throne. It would be useless to give him that, for the throne cant be preserved. don't you know that the Galactic Empire is in a state of decay, that it cannot endure for much longer? Trantor itself is slowly sliding into ruin because of the ever-increasing weight of administering twenty-five million worlds. Whats ahead of us is breakup and civil war, no matter what you do for Cleon."</p><p>“哈里，”她说，“稍微想想克里昂和我的不同之处。克里昂想从你身上得到的，无疑只是保障皇位的一种宣传。满足他这一点毫无意义，因为他的皇位根本保不住。难道你不知道，银河帝国处于一种衰败状态，不可能再支持多久了？管理两千五百万个世界所带来的越来越沉重的负担，令川陀本身正逐渐步向灭亡。不论你为克里昂做些什么，等在前面的都是分裂和内战。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I have heard something like this said. It may even be true, but what then?"</p><p>谢顿道：“我曾经听过一些类似的说法。它甚至有可能是真的，但是又怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then, help it break into fragments without any war. Help me take Trantor. Help me establish a firm government over a realm small enough to be ruled efficiently. Let me give freedom to the rest of the Galaxy, each portion to go its own way according to its own customs and cultures. The Galaxy will become a working whole again through the free agencies of trade, tourism, and communication and the fate of cracking into disaster under the present rule of force that barely holds it together will be averted. My ambition is moderate indeed; one world, not millions; peace, not war; freedom, not slavery. Think about it and help me."</p><p>“所以说，应该帮它在毫无战事的状况下分裂。帮助我取得川陀；帮助我建立一个稳固的政府，来统治一个足够小、足以有效治理的领域。让我把自由还给银河各个角落，让每个成员依照自身的习俗和文化各行其是。银河将会借着贸易、观光和通讯等自由媒介，再度变成一个活生生的整体。这样一来，便能避免在目前这个几乎无法维系的统治力量之下，整个银河崩溃瓦解的悲惨命运。我的野心实在有限；一个世界，而不是百千万；和平，而不是战争；自由，而不是奴役。仔细想想，答应帮助我吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Why should the Galaxy believe me any more than they would believe you? They don't know me and which of our fleet commanders will be impressed by the mere word psychohistory?"</p><p>谢顿说：“银河黎民既然不相信你，又为什么会相信我？他们根本不认识我。而我们的那些舰队指挥官，有哪个听到‘心理史学’四个字便会动容？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You wont be believed now, but I don't ask for action now. The House of Wye, having waited thousands of years, can wait thousands of days more. Cooperate with me and I will make your name famous. I will make the promise of psychohistory glow through all the worlds and at the proper time, when I judge the movement to be the chosen moment, you will pronounce your prediction and we will strike. Then, in a twinkling of history, the Galaxy will exist under a New Order that will render it stable and happy for eons. Come now, Hari, can you refuse me?"</p><p>“现在不会有人相信你，但是我不需要现在就行动。卫荷世族已经等待了数千年，还可以再多等几千个日子。只要和我合作，我会让你的名字响彻银河，我会让每个世界都知道心理史学成功在望。而在适当的时候，当我判断时机成熟的那一刻，你就发表你的预测，而我们则发动攻击。然后，在历史的下一瞬间，银河便会处于一个新秩序之下，享有永永远远的稳定和幸福。来吧，哈里，你能拒绝我吗？”</p></div>
