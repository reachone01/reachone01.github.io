<div class='layout'><p>12 Aerie</p><p>第12章 长老阁</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ROBOT…………A term used in the ancient legends of several worlds for what are more usually called "automata." Robots are described as generally human in shape and made of metal, although some are supposed to have been pseudo-organic in nature. Hari Seldon, in the course of The Flight, is popularly supposed to have seen an actual robot, but that story is of dubious origin. Nowhere in Seldons voluminous writings does he mention robots at all, although ...</p><p>机仆：……某些世界的古代传说中所使用的词汇，与较通行的名称“机器人”同义。根据记载，机仆一般皆由金属制成，外形酷似人类，不过有些机仆的材料可能为假有机物质。盛传哈里·谢顿在“逃亡期”曾亲眼见到一个真正的机仆，但此一轶闻并不可靠。在谢顿浩瀚的着作中，从未提到任何机仆，不过……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p><p>……《银河百科全书》</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were not noticed.</p><p>没有人注意他们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili repeated the trip of the day before and this time no one gave them a second look. Hardly anyone even gave them a first look. On several occasions, they had to tuck their knees to one side to allow someone sitting on an inner seat to get past them and out. When someone got in, they quickly realized they had to move over if there was an inner empty seat. </p><p>哈里·谢顿与铎丝·凡纳比里重复着昨日的行程，这次没有任何人多看他们一眼，甚至几乎没有人注意到他们。在公车上有好几次，他们必须将膝盖偏向一侧，好让坐在内侧的人下车。而在有人上车之后，只要内侧还有空位，他们立刻明白应该向内移动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This time they quickly grew tired of the smell of kirtles that were not freshly laundered because they were not so easily diverted by what went on outside. </p><p>这一回，他们很快就受不了久未洗涤的裰服所发出的气味，因为他们不再那么容易被车外的事物吸引。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But eventually they were there.</p><p>无论如何，他们总算抵达目的地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thats the library," said Seldon in a low voice.</p><p>“那就是图书馆。”谢顿低声道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I suppose so," said Dors. "At least thats the building that Mycelium Seventy-Two pointed out yesterday."</p><p>“我想没错。”铎丝说，“至少，它就是菌丝七十二昨天指的那栋建筑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They sauntered toward it leisurely.</p><p>他们以悠闲的步伐朝它走去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Take a deep breath," said Seldon. "This is the first hurdle."</p><p>“深呼吸一下，”谢顿说，“这是第一道关卡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The door ahead was open, the light within subdued. There were five broad stone steps leading upward. They stepped onto the lowermost one and waited several moments before they realized that their weight did not cause the steps to move upward. Dors grimaced very slightly and gestured Seldon upward. </p><p>前面的门开着，里面的光线柔和而偏暗，门前则有五级宽阔的石阶。他们踏上最低的一级，等了好一会儿，才了解自己的重量并未使阶梯上升。铎丝做了一个浅浅的鬼脸，挥手示意谢顿往上走。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Together they walked up the stairs, feeling embarrassed on behalf of Mycogen for its backwardness. Then, through a door, where, at a desk immediately inside was a man bent over the simplest and clumsiest computer Seldon had ever seen. </p><p>当他们一起走上阶梯时，都为这种落后而替麦曲生感到难为情。然后，他们走进一道门，室内近门处摆着一张办公桌，有个男的埋首于一台电脑前，谢顿从未见过那么简单、那么粗陋的电脑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The man did not look up at them. No need, Seldon supposed. White kirtle, bald head……all Mycogenians looked so nearly the same that ones eyes slid off them and that was to the tribespeoples advantage at the moment.</p><p>那个男的并未抬头看看他们。根本没有必要，谢顿这么想。白色的裰服，光秃的头颅……所有的麦曲生人看来几乎都差不多，眼光扫过并不会留下任何印象。而在这个节骨眼上，这点成了外族人的有利因素。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The man, who still seemed to be studying something on the desk, said, "Scholars?"</p><p>那人似乎仍在研究桌上的一样东西。“学者吗？”他问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Scholars," said Seldon.</p><p>“学者。”谢顿答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The man jerked his head toward a door. "Go in. Enjoy."</p><p>那人突然朝一扇门摆了摆头。“进去吧，尽情研究。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They moved inward and, as nearly as they could see, they were the only ones in this section of the library. Either the library was not a popular resort or the scholars were few or……most likely……both.</p><p>他们进去后，发现目力所及的范围内，他们是图书馆这一区仅有的两个人。若非这间图书馆并不是热门的去处，就是学者为数极少，而更可能的情况，则是两者同时成立。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon whispered, "I thought surely we would have to present some sort of license or permission form and I would have to plead having forgotten it."</p><p>谢顿悄声道：“我本来以为，我们一定得出示某种执照或许可文件，我准备辩称我忘了带。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He probably welcomes our presence under any terms. Did you ever see a place like this? If a place, like a person, could be dead, we would be inside a corpse."</p><p>“不论在任何情况下，说不定他都会欢迎我们。你见过像这样的地方吗？如果地方像人一样也会死亡，我们就是在一具尸体里面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Most of the books in this section were print-books like the Book in Seldons inner pocket. Dors drifted along the shelves, studying them. She said, "Old books, for the most part. Part classic. Part worthless."</p><p>这一区的图书大部分是字体书，就像谢顿内袋里的那本典籍一样。铎丝一面沿着书架游走，一面研究其上陈列的书籍。“古书，大多数都是。部分是经典名着，部分则一文不值。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Outside books? Non-Mycogen, I mean?"</p><p>“是外界的书籍吗？我的意思是非麦曲生的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh yes. If they have their own books, they must be kept in another section. This one is for outside research for poor little self-styled scholars like yesterdays……This is the reference department and heres an Imperial Encyclopedia……must be fifty years old if a day……and a computer." </p><p>“喔，没错。如果他们有自己的书籍，也一定收藏在另一区。本区专供那些可怜的自命学者进行‘外界研究’，比如说昨天那位。这是参考图书部，这里有一套《帝国百科全书》……一定有五十年的历史，绝少不了……还有一台电脑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She reached for the keys and Seldon stopped her. "Wait. Something could go wrong and well be delayed."</p><p>她伸手想触动按键，谢顿却阻止她。“等一等。万一出什么问题，我们就会被耽搁了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He pointed to a discreet sign above a free-standing set of shelves that glowed with the letters TO THE SACR TORIUM. The second A in SACRATORIUM was dead, possibly recently or possibly because no one cared. (The Empire, thought Seldon, was in decay. All parts of it. Mycogen too.)</p><p>他指着一排独立书架上的一个朴素标志，上面映着“往圣堂”三个闪亮的字体，其中“圣”字有些笔画黯淡无光，也许是最近才坏的，也可能是因为无人在意。帝国正在衰败，谢顿想道，每一部分皆然，麦曲生也不例外。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He looked about. The poor library, so necessary to Mycogenian pride, perhaps so useful to the Elders who could use it to find crumbs to shore up their own beliefs and present them as being those of sophisticated tribespeople, seemed to be completely empty. No one had entered after them.</p><p>他四下张望一番。这间简陋的图书馆似乎空无一人，没有人跟在他们后面进来。虽说对麦曲生的骄傲而言，它是不可或缺的一环；而它对长老们则可能极为有用，他们得以从中找到只字片语，用来支撑他们的信仰，再将疑点归咎于世故的外族人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Lets step in here, out of eyeshot of the man at the door, and put on our saShe's."</p><p>谢顿说：“我们走到这儿来，避开门口那人的视线，然后戴上肩带。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then, at the door, aware suddenly there would be no turning back if they passed this second hurdle, he said, "Dors, don't come in with me."</p><p>在那扇门前，他突然意识到只要越过这第二道关卡，他们就再也无法回头。他说：“铎丝，别跟我进来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She frowned. "Why not?"</p><p>她皱起眉头。“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its not safe and I don't want you to be at risk."</p><p>“这不安全，我不要你身陷险境。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am here to protect you," she said with soft firmness.</p><p>“我来这里就是要保护你。”她以坚定的口吻，不疾不徐地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What kind of protection can you be? I can protect myself, though you may not think it. And Id be handicapped by having to protect you. don't you see that?"</p><p>“你能提供什么样的保护？我可以保护自己，虽然你也许不以为然。反之，我却会为了保护你而缚手缚脚，难道你不明白吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You mustnt be concerned about me, Hari," said Dors. "Concern is my part." She tapped her sash where it crossed in the space between her obscured breasts.</p><p>“哈里，你绝不要为我担心。”铎丝说，“担心是我的事。”她拍拍藏在裰服下的胸脯，落手处正好是肩带。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because Hummin asked you to?"</p><p>“因为夫铭要求你这么做？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because those are my orders."</p><p>“因为这是我的使命。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She seized Seldons arms just above his elbow and, as always, he was surprised by her firm grip. She said, "Im against this, Hari, but if you feel you must go in, then I must go in too."</p><p>她伸出双手，抓住谢顿的上臂。如同往常一样，她的铁爪令他惊讶不已。她说：“我反对这样做，哈里，但你若是觉得非进去不可，那我也一定要跟进去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"All right, then. But if anything happens and you can wriggle out of it, run. don't worry about me."</p><p>“既然这样，好吧。可是，万一发生什么事，而你能逃脱的话，那就赶快跑，不要顾虑我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Youre wasting your breath, Hari. And youre insulting me."</p><p>“你在白费唇舌，哈里，而且是在侮辱我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon touched the entrance panel and the portal slid open. Together, almost in unison, they walked through.</p><p>谢顿按了一下开启触板，那扇门便向一侧滑开。他们两人一起走进去，动作几乎完全一致。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A large room, all the larger because it was empty of anything resembling furniture. No chairs, no benches, no seats of any kind. No stage, no drapery, no decorations.</p><p>这是一间很大的房间，由于没有任何家具之类的陈设，因此显得更为宽敞。没有椅子，没有长凳，没有任何种类的座位。也没有高台，没有帘幔，没有任何的装潢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No lights, merely a uniform illumination of mild, unfocused light. The walls were not entirely blank. Periodically, arranged in spaced fashion at various heights and in no easy repetitive order, there were small, primitive, two-dimensional television screens, all of which were operating. From where Dors and Seldon stood, there was not even the illusion of a third dimension, not a breath of true holovision.</p><p>甚至没有灯光，只有均匀、柔和、漫射的照明光线。四面墙壁并非全然空洞，上面嵌装着许多小型而原始的二维电视荧幕，而且全都开着。它们相互间有固定的间隔，彼此的高度却不尽相同，其中的规律并不容易掌握。从铎丝与谢顿的位置看过去，甚至无法产生第三维的幻觉，换句话说，连全息电视的影子都没有。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were people present. Not many and nowhere together. They stood singly and, like the television monitors, in no easy repetitive order. All were white-kirtled, all sashed.</p><p>那里已经有些人，但人数不多，而且并没有聚在一块。他们零星站在各处，也像那些电视显像器一样，其中的规律不易掌握。每个人都身穿白色裰服，每个人都披挂着肩带。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For the most part, there was silence. No one talked in the usual sense. Some moved their lips, murmuring softly. Those who walked did so stealthily, eyes downcast.</p><p>大部分的时间，这里面安静无声。没有人以平常的方式说话，只有一些人蠕动着嘴唇，轻声地喃喃自语。走动的人都蹑手蹑脚，而且一律目光朝下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The atmosphere was absolutely funereal.</p><p>这种气氛简直与葬礼无异。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon leaned toward Dors, who instantly put a finger to her lips, then pointed to one of the television monitors. The screen showed an idyllic garden bursting with blooms, the camera panning over it slowly. </p><p>谢顿倾身凑向铎丝，她立刻伸出一根指头放在唇边，然后朝一个电视显像器指了指。荧幕上映出一个如诗如画、花朵盛开的花园，镜头正在缓缓移动，将全景逐一呈现。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They walked toward the monitor in a fashion that imitated the others……slow steps, putting each foot down softly.</p><p>他们模仿其他人的方式，朝那个显像器走去……缓缓挪动脚步，每一步都轻轻放下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When they were within half a meter of the screen, a soft insinuating voice made itself heard: "The garden of Antennin, as reproduced from ancient guidebooks and photographs, located in the outskirts of Eos. Note the……"</p><p>当他们距离荧幕只有半米时，传来一阵轻柔而媚气的声音：“安特宁花园，坐落于伊奥斯近郊，根据古代旅游指南与照片复制。请注意……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said in a whisper Seldon had trouble catching over the sound of the set, "It turns on when someone is close and it will turn off if we step away. If were close enough, we can talk under cover, but don't look at me and stop speaking if anyone approaches."</p><p>铎丝开始悄声说话，令谢顿无法再听清楚电视机传出的声音。她说：“有人走近时它就开启，我们走开后就会自动关闭。如果我们靠得够近，便能在它的掩护之下交谈，可是别望着我，万一有人接近就立刻闭嘴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon, his head bent, his hands clasped before him (he had noted that this was a preferred posture), said, "Any moment I expect someone to start wailing."</p><p>谢顿低着头，双手交握摆在胸前（他早已注意到，这是最受欢迎的一种姿势），说道：“我随时预期有人会放声哭泣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Someone might. Theyre mourning their Lost World," said Dors.</p><p>“也许有人会这么做，他们正在哀悼他们的失落世界。”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I hope they change the films every once in a while. It would be deadly to always see the same ones."</p><p>“我希望他们每隔一阵子会更换一次影片，总是看同样的内容可真要命。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Theyre all different," said Dors, her eyes sliding this way and that. "They may change periodically. I don't know."</p><p>“影片全都不一样。”铎丝的眼睛来回扫描了一下，“或许会定期更换内容，我也不知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wait!" said Seldon just a hairs breadth too loud. He lowered his voice and said, "Come this way."</p><p>“等一等！”谢顿的音量升高了丝毫，接着又压低声音说：“到这里来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors frowned, failing to make out the words, but Seldon gestured slightly with his head. Again the stealthy walk, but Seldons footsteps increased in length as he felt the need for greater speed and Dors, catching up, pulled sharply……if very briefly……at his kirtle. He slowed.</p><p>铎丝皱起眉头，她没听清楚那几个字，好在谢顿又轻轻摆头示意。他们再度蹑手蹑脚地走动，但谢顿的脚步愈迈愈大，因为他感到有需要加快步伐。铎丝追上来，猛然拉住他的裰服……只是一瞬间的动作，他便放慢了脚步。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Robots here," he said under the cover of the sound as it came on. </p><p>“这里有机器人。”他在电视机声音掩护下说道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The picture showed the corner of a dwelling place with a rolling lawn and a line of hedges in the foreground and three of what could only be described as robots. They were metallic, apparently, and vaguely human in shape.</p><p>画面是一栋住宅的一角，前景是一片起伏的草坪与一列树篱，此外还有三个只能形容为机器人的东西。它们显然都是金属制品，外形有几分接近人类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The recording said, "This is a view, recently constructed, of the establishment of the famous Wendome estate of the third century. The robot you see near the center was, according to tradition, named Bendar and served twenty-two years, according to the ancient records, before being replaced."</p><p>录音的旁白说：“这是新近制作的画面，是三世纪时温都姆属地的着名建筑。接近正中央的那个机仆，根据民间传说名叫本达；而根据古代的记录，它在被替换前服务了二十二年。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, " Recently constructed, so they must change views."</p><p>铎丝说：“‘新近制作的’，所以他们一定经常更换画面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Unless theyve been saying recently constructed for the last thousand years."</p><p>“除非他们这句‘新近制作的’说了有一千年。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Another Mycogenian stepped into the sound pattern of the scene and said in a low voice, though not as low as the whisperings of Seldon and Dors, "Greetings, Brothers."</p><p>此时，另一个麦曲生人走进这个声域。他压低声音，不过并没有谢顿与铎丝的耳语那么低，说道：“两位兄弟，你们好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did not look at Seldon and Dors as he spoke and after one involuntary and startled glance, Seldon kept his head averted. Dors had ignored it all. </p><p>当他说话的时候，双眼并未望着谢顿与铎丝。谢顿在惊吓之余，曾不自觉地瞥了他一眼，便赶紧将头转开；铎丝则完全没有理会这个人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon hesitated. Mycelium Seventy-Two had said that there was no talking in the Sacratorium. Perhaps he had exaggerated. Then too he had not been in the Sacratorium since he was a child.</p><p>谢顿感到犹豫不决。菌丝七十二曾说圣堂内禁止交谈，也许他言过其实。话说回来，他成年后再也未曾进入圣堂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Desperately, Seldon decided he must speak. He said in a whisper, "And to you, Brother, greetings."</p><p>走投无路之下，谢顿认定自己必须开口。他悄声道：“这位兄弟，你好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had no idea whether that was the correct formula of reply or if there was a formula, but the Mycogenian seemed to find nothing amiss in it. </p><p>他根本不晓得这是不是正确的答复用语，或者这种用语是否存在。不过，那位麦曲生人好像并不觉得有什么不对劲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To you in Aurora, he said.</p><p>“愿你重归奥罗拉怀抱。”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And to you," said Seldon and because it seemed to him that the other expected more, he added, "in Aurora," and there was an impalpable release of tension. Seldon felt his forehead growing moist.</p><p>“也愿你重归……”谢顿说到这里，由于感到对方似乎期待他再说下去，于是赶紧补上：“奥罗拉怀抱。”直到这个时候，紧张状态才消弭于无形，谢顿察觉自己的额头正在冒汗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Mycogenian said, "Beautiful! I haven't seen this before."</p><p>那位麦曲生人说：“真漂亮！我以前从没看过这个画面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Skillfully done," said Seldon. Then, in a burst of daring, he added, "A loss never to be forgotten."</p><p>“做得很精巧。”接着，谢顿壮着胆子加上一句，“这是永难忘怀的失落。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other seemed startled, then said, "Indeed, indeed," and moved away.</p><p>对方似乎吓了一跳，回应道：“的确，的确。”说完便径自离去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors hissed, "Take no chances. don't say what you don't have to."</p><p>铎丝发出嘘声，并说：“不要冒险，也别说没有必要的话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It seemed natural. Anyway, this it recent. But those are disappointing robots. They are what I would expect automata to be. I want to see the organic ones……the humanoids."</p><p>“这似乎很自然。无论如何，这的确是新近的作品。可是那些机仆令人失望，在我想象中，机器人才是那个样子。我想见见有机体的机仆……具有人形的那种。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If they existed," said Dors with some hesitation, "it seems to me they wouldnt be used for gardening jobs."</p><p>“前提是它们必须存在。”铎丝的口气有些迟疑，“在我的感觉中，它们不会用来从事园艺工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"True," said Seldon. "We must find the Elders aerie."</p><p>“正是如此。”谢顿说，“我们必须找到长老阁。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If that exists. It seems to me there is nothing in this hollow cave but a hollow cave."</p><p>“前提是长老阁必须存在。在我的感觉中，这个空洞的洞穴除了空洞还是空洞。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Lets look."</p><p>“我们来找找看。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They paced along the wall, passing from screen to screen, trying to wait at each for irregular intervals until Dors clutched Seldons arms. Between two screens were lines marking out a faint rectangle.</p><p>他们沿着墙壁向前走，经过一个又一个荧幕，刻意在每个荧幕前停留长短不一的时间。最后，铎丝突然紧紧抓住谢顿的双臂，原来在某两个荧幕之间，有些线条隐约构成一个矩形的轮廓。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A door," Dors said. Then she weakened the assertion by adding, "Do you think?"</p><p>“一道门。”铎丝说完，又有所保留地问道，“你认为是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked about surreptitiously. It was in the highest degree convenient that, in keeping with the mourning atmosphere, every face, when not fixed on a television monitor, was bent in sad concentration on the floor.</p><p>谢顿暗中四下张望一番。为了维持哀伤的气氛，每个人的脸不是盯着电视显像器，就是以悲伤的心情低头面对地板。对他们两人而言，这是最方便不过的情况。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "How do you suppose it would open?"</p><p>谢顿说：“你猜它怎么打开？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"An entrance patch."</p><p>“开启触片？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I cant make out any."</p><p>“我找不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its just not marked out, but theres a slight discoloration there. Do you see it? How many palms? How many times?"</p><p>“只是没标出而已，不过那里有点变色，你看到没有？接触过多少手掌？被按了多少次？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ill try. Keep an eye out and kick me if anyone looks in this direction."</p><p>“我来试试。你帮我把风，如果有人向这边望来，赶紧踢我一下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He held his breath casually, touched the discolored spot to no avail, and then placed his palm full upon it and pressed.</p><p>他稍稍屏住气息，碰了碰那个变色的部位，可是没有任何反应。于是他将手掌完全按上去，并用力一压。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The door opened silently……not a creak, not a scrape. Seldon stepped through as rapidly as he could and Dors followed him. The door closed behind them.</p><p>嵌在墙上的那扇门静静开启，没有吱吱作响，也没有摩擦声。谢顿尽快钻进去，铎丝则紧跟在他后面。两人进去后，那道门又重新关上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The question is," said Dors, "did anyone see us?"</p><p>“现在的问题是，”铎丝说，“有没有人看到我们？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Elders must go through this door frequently."</p><p>谢顿说：“长老们一定经常由这道门出入。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but will anyone think we are Elders?"</p><p>“没错，可是会有人把我们当长老吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon waited, then said, "If we were observed and if anyone thought something was wrong, this door would have been flung open again within fifteen seconds of our entering."</p><p>谢顿等了一下，然后说：“如果有人发现我们，而且觉得有点不对劲，那么我们进来不到十五秒钟，这道门就会被撞开了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Possibly," said Dors dryly, "or possibly there is nothing to be seen or done on this side of the door and no one cares if we enter."</p><p>“有这个可能，”铎丝淡淡地说，“但也有可能穿过这扇门之后，根本没什么值得看、值得偷的东西，所以没有人会在意不速之客。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That remains to be seen," muttered Seldon.</p><p>“这点还要等着瞧。”谢顿咕哝道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The rather narrow room they had entered was somewhat dark, but as they stepped farther into it, the light brightened.</p><p>他们进入的这个房间稍嫌狭窄，而且有几分昏暗，不过他们多走几步之后，室内随即大放光明。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were chairs, wide and comfortable, small tables, several davenports, a deep and tall refrigerator, cupboards.</p><p>房间里有些宽大而舒适的椅子，以及几张小桌、好几张坐卧两用的沙发、一台又深又高的冰箱，此外还有一些碗柜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If this is the Elders aerie," said Seldon, "the Elders seem to do themselves comfortably, despite the austerity of the Sacratorium itself."</p><p>“如果这就是长老阁，”谢顿说，“长老们似乎让自己过得很舒服，虽然圣堂本身简朴而肃穆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As would be expected," said Dors. "Asceticism among a ruling class……except for public show……is very rare. Put that down in your notebook for psychohistorical aphorisms." She looked about. "And there is no robot."</p><p>“这是意料中的事，”铎丝说，“统治阶级力行禁欲生活的少之又少，只有公开场合例外。把这点记在你的笔记簿上，作为心理史学的金科玉律之一。”她四下望了望，“这里也没有机器人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "An aerie is a high position, remember, and this ceiling is not. There must be upper storeys and that must be the way." He pointed to a well-carpeted stairway.</p><p>谢顿说：“别忘了，阁代表高处，这个天花板却并不高。上面一定还有许多楼层，而通道一定就在那里。”他指着铺有高级地毯的楼梯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did not advance toward it, however, but looked about vaguely.</p><p>然而，他并未向楼梯走去，却以暧昧的动作四下打量。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors guessed what he was seeking. She said, "Forget about elevators. Theres a cult of primitivism in Mycogen. Surely, you haven't forgotten that, have you? There would be no elevators and, whats more, if we place our weight at the foot of the stairs, I am quite certain it will not begin moving upward. Were going to have to climb it. Several flights, perhaps."</p><p>铎丝猜到他在找什么。“别再想升降机了。麦曲生有一种崇拜原始主义的风尚，不用说，这点你还没忘记吧？不会有升降机的，而且，即使我们的重量压在楼梯底端，我也相当确定，它绝不会向上移动。我们必须爬上去，也许有好几层呢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Climb it?"</p><p>“爬上去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It must, in the nature of things, lead to the aerie……if it leads anywhere. Do you want to see the aerie or don't you?"</p><p>“它一定是通往长老阁，这是理所当然的事……除非它哪里也不通。你究竟要不要去长老阁看一看？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Together they stepped toward the staircase and began the climb. </p><p>于是他们一起走向楼梯间，开始向上爬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They went up three flights and, as they did, the light level decreased perceptibly and in steady increments. Seldon took a deep breath and whispered, "I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, but I hate this."</p><p>楼层愈高，光线的强度愈是稳定地、显着地递减。等到他们爬了三层之后，谢顿深深吸一口气，悄声说道：“我自认身体状况相当好，但我痛恨这种运动。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“你只是不习惯这种消耗体力的方式。”她一点也没有筋疲力尽的迹象。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At the top of the third flight the stairs ended and before them was another door.</p><p>这道楼梯终止于第三层的顶端，然后，他们面前又出现了另一道门。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And if its locked?" said Seldon, more to himself than to Dors. "Do we try to break it down?"</p><p>“万一锁住了呢？”谢顿这句话不大像是对铎丝说的，反倒更像自言自语。“我们要试着撞开吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Dors said, "Why should it be locked when the lower door was not? If this is the Elders aerie, I imagine theres a taboo on anyone but Elders coming here and a taboo is much stronger than any lock."</p><p>铎丝却说：“既然下面的门没锁，这里又何必上锁呢？假使这就是长老阁，我猜想应该有个禁忌，禁止长老之外的人进入，而禁忌要比任何的锁更为牢靠。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As far as those who accept the taboo are concerned," said Seldon, but he made no move toward the door.</p><p>“只对那些接受禁忌的人有效。”谢顿虽然这么说，却并未向那道门走去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Theres still time to turn back, since you hesitate," said Dors. "In fact, I would advise you to rum back."</p><p>“既然你踌躇不前，现在还有时间向后转。”铎丝说，“事实上，我很想劝你向后转。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I only hesitate because I don't know what well find inside. If its empty……" </p><p>“我之所以踌躇不前，只是因为不知道会在里面发现什么。万一是空的……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then he added in a rather louder voice, "Then its empty," and he strode forward and pushed against the entry panel.</p><p>然后，他拉开嗓门补充道：“空的就空的吧。”说完他就大步向前，按了一下开启触板。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The door retracted with silent speed and Seldon took a step back at the surprising flood of light from within.</p><p>那道门迅疾无声地缩入墙内，里面立刻涌出一股强光，谢顿惊愕之余，连忙后退一步。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And there, facing him, eyes alive with light, arms half-upraised, one foot slightly advanced before the other, gleaming with a faintly yellow metallic shine, was a human figure. For a few moments, it seemed to be wearing a tight-fitting tunic, but on closer inspection it became apparent that the tunic was part of the structure of the object.</p><p>面对着他的是一个人形，它的双眼炯炯有光，双臂平举，一只脚稍微向前踏出，全身闪耀着微弱的黄色金属光芒。乍看它似乎穿着一件紧身短袖袍，但在仔细审视之下，那件衣服显然是该物件整体的一部分。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its the robot," said Seldon in awe, "but its metallic."</p><p>“是个机器人，”谢顿以敬畏的口吻说，“但它是金属制品。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Worse than that," said Dors, who had stepped quickly to one side and then to the other. "Its eyes don't follow me. Its arms don't as much as tremble. Its not alive……if one can speak of robots as being alive." </p><p>“更糟的是，”刚才曾迅速左右挪移脚步的铎丝说，“它的眼睛没跟着我移动，它的手臂连颤抖的动作都没有。如果我们能说机器人也有死有活，那么它显然属于前者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And a man……unmistakably a man……stepped out from behind the robot and said, "Perhaps not. But I am alive."</p><p>这时，一个人……百分之百的真人……从那个机器人身后走出来，说道：“它也许是死的，但我可是活生生的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And almost automatically, Dors stepped forward and took her place between Seldon and the man who had suddenly appeared.</p><p>铎丝几乎自发地立刻踏出一步，站到谢顿和那个突然出现的人之间。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon pushed Dors to one side, perhaps a shade more roughly than he intended.</p><p>谢顿将铎丝推到一旁，这个动作或许比他的本意要粗鲁些许。“我不需要保护，这是我们的老朋友日主十四。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't need protection. This is our old friend Sunmaster Fourteen." The man who faced them, wearing a double sash that was perhaps his right as High Elder, said, "And you are Tribesman Seldon."</p><p>面对他们的那个人披挂着一双肩带，这也许是他身为元老的一种权利。他说：“而你是外族男子谢顿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course," said Seldon.</p><p>“当然。”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And this, despite her masculine dress, is Tribeswoman Venabili."</p><p>“而这位，尽管她穿着男性服装，则是外族女子凡纳比里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said nothing.</p><p>铎丝什么也没说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, "You are right, of course, tribesman. You are in no danger of physical harm from me. Please sit down. Both of you. Since you are not a Sister, tribeswoman, you need not retire. There is a seat for you which, if you value such a distinction, you will be the first woman ever to have used."</p><p>日主十四道：“你说得当然对，外族男子。你们没有危险，我不会伤害你们。请坐，两位都请坐。既然你不是一位姐妹，外族女子，你就没有必要退下。你可以坐在这里，你将是第一个坐上这个座位的女人，但愿你珍视这样的殊荣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I do not value such a distinction," said Dors, spacing her words for emphasis. </p><p>“我不珍视这样的殊荣。”铎丝一字一顿地强调。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen nodded. "That is as you wish. I too will sit down, for I must ask you questions and I do not care to do it standing." </p><p>日主十四点了点头。“随你的便。我也要坐下来，因为我必须问你们一些问题，而我不喜欢站着做这件事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were sitting now in a corner of the room. Seldons eyes wandered to the metal robot.</p><p>他们在房间的一个角落坐定，谢顿的眼睛便游移到那个金属机器人身上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, "It is a robot."</p><p>日主十四说：“那是个机仆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know," said Seldon briefly.</p><p>“我知道。”谢顿简短地答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know you do," said Sunmaster Fourteen with similar curtness. "But now that we have settled that matter, why are you here?"</p><p>“这点我知道。”日主十四的话也同样简略，“既然我们已经达成这个共识，现在我要问，你们来这里做什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon gazed steadily at Sunmaster Fourteen and said, "To see the robot."</p><p>谢顿目不转睛地凝视着日主十四。“来看这个机仆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you know that no one but an Elder is allowed in the aerie?"</p><p>“你可知道除了长老或元老，任何人都不准进入长老阁？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I did not know that, but I suspected it."</p><p>“我不知道这件事，但是我料到了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you know that no tribesperson is allowed in the Sacratorium?"</p><p>“你可知道外族人一律不准进入圣堂？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I was told that."</p><p>“我听说了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you ignored the fact, is that it?"</p><p>“而你却漠视这件事，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As I said, we wanted to see the robot."</p><p>“正如我所说，我们想看那个机仆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you know that no woman, even a Sister, is allowed in the Sacratorium except at certain stated……and rare……occasions?"</p><p>“你可知道除了某些特定的……而且罕有的节日之外，任何一个女人，包括姐妹在内，都不可以进入圣堂？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I was told that."</p><p>“我也听说了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And do you know that no woman is at any time……or for any reason……allowed to dress in masculine garb? That holds, within the borders of Mycogen, for tribeswomen as well as for Sisters."</p><p>“你可知道不论任何时候，无论任何理由，女人都不准穿着男性服装？在麦曲生境内，这点非但适用于姐妹，也同样适用于外族女子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I was not told that, but I am not surprised."</p><p>“这点我没听说过，但我并不惊讶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Good. I want you to understand all this. Now, why did you want to see the robot?"</p><p>“很好，我要你了解这一切的前提。现在告诉我，你为何想要看这个机仆？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said with a shrug, "Curiosity. I had never seen a robot or even known that such a thing existed."</p><p>谢顿耸了耸肩，说道：“出于好奇。我从没见过机仆，甚至不知道世上有这种东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And how did you come to know that it did exist and, specifically, that it existed here?"</p><p>“那你怎么知道它的确存在，而且还知道它就在这里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was silent, then said, "I do not wish to answer that question."</p><p>谢顿沉默了一会儿，然后说：“我不愿意回答这个问题。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is that why you were brought to Mycogen by Tribesman Hummin? To investigate robots?"</p><p>“难道这就是外族男子夫铭送你们来麦曲生的原因？前来调查机仆？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. Tribesman Hummin brought us here that we might be secure. However, we are scholars, Dr. Venabili and I. Knowledge is our province and to gain knowledge is our purpose. Mycogen is little understood outside its borders and we wish to know more about your ways and your methods of thought. It is a natural desire and, it seems to us, a harmless……even praiseworthy……one."</p><p>“不，外族男子夫铭送我们来这里，是希望确保我们的安全。然而，我们是学者，凡纳比里博士和我都是。知识是我们的疆场，求取知识是我们的人生目标。麦曲生的一切鲜为外界了解，我们希望多知道些你们的风土民情和思考方式。这是很自然的渴望，而且在我们看来，是无害的……甚至值得赞赏的渴望。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah, but we do not wish the outer tribes and worlds to know about us. That is our natural desire and we are the judge of what is harmless to us and what harmful. So I ask you again, tribesman: How did you know that a robot existed in Mycogen and that it existed in this room?"</p><p>“啊，我们却不希望外族人和其他世界了解我们，这是我们的自然渴望。至于什么对我们无害，什么对我们有害，要由我们自己来判断。所以外族男子，我再问你一遍，你怎么知道麦曲生境内有个机仆，而且藏在这个房间里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"General rumor," said Seldon at length.</p><p>“道听途说。”谢顿终于做了回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you insist on that?"</p><p>“你坚持这个答案吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"General rumor. I insist on it."</p><p>“道听途说，我坚持这个答案。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteens keen blue eyes seemed to sharpen and he said without raising his voice, "Tribesman Seldon, we have long cooperated with Tribesman Hummin. For a tribesman, he has seemed a decent and trustworthy individual. For a tribesman! When he brought you two to us and commended you to our protection, we granted it. But Tribesman Hummin, whatever his virtues, is still a tribesman and we had misgivings. We were not at all sure what your……or his……real purpose might be."</p><p>日主十四锐利的蓝眼珠似乎变得更为尖锐，但他并未提高音量。“外族男子谢顿，我们和外族男子夫铭有长久的合作关系。就外族人而言，他似乎始终是高尚而且值得信赖的人。仅就一个外族人而言！当他把你们两位送来，嘱托我们保护你们的时候，我们答应了他。但不论外族男子夫铭有多少美德，他仍旧是个外族人，我们还是放心不下。当初，我们完全无法确定你们的……或是他的……真正目的是什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Our purpose was knowledge," said Seldon. "Academic knowledge. Tribeswoman Venabili is a historian and I too have an interest in history. Why should we not be interested in Mycogenian history?"</p><p>“我们的目的是知识，”谢顿说，“学术性的知识。外族女子凡纳比里是历史学家，而我自己也喜欢历史。我们为何不该对麦曲生的历史感兴趣？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For one thing, because we do not wish you to be……In any case, two of our trusted Sisters were sent to you. They were to cooperate with you, try to find out what it was you wanted, and……what is the expression you tribesmen use?……play along with you. Yet not in such a way that you would be too aware as to what was happening."</p><p>“原因之一，是我们不希望你们感兴趣。总之，我们派了两位信得过的姐妹到你们身边。她们奉命和你们合作，试图查出你们究竟想要什么，还有……你们外族人是怎么说的……跟你们假戏真做。然而，却不让你们察觉她们真正的意图。”日主十四微微一笑，但那却是一个狞笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen smiled, but it was a grim smile. "Raindrop Forty-Five," Sunmaster Fourteen went on, "went shopping with Tribeswoman Venabili, but there seemed nothing out of the way in what happened on those trips. Naturally, we had a full report. Raindrop Forty-Three showed you, Tribesman Seldon, our microfarms. You might have been suspicious of her willingness to accompany you alone, something that is utterly out of the question for us, but you reasoned that what applied to Brothers did not apply to tribesmen and you flattered yourself that that flimsy bit of reasoning won her over. She complied with your desire, though at considerable cost to her peace of mind. And, eventually, you asked for the Book. To have handed it over too easily might have roused your suspicion, so she pretended to a perverse desire only you could satisfy. Her self-sacrifice will not be forgotten……I take it, tribesman, you still have the Book and I suspect you have it with you now. May I have it?"</p><p>“雨点四十五，”日主十四继续说，“陪同外族女子凡纳比里逛街购物，但在几次行程中，似乎并没有发生什么不寻常的事。自然，我们接获了完整的报告。雨点四十三则带领你，外族男子谢顿，去参观我们的微生农场。本来，你可能会怀疑她为何愿意单独陪你去，这对我们而言应该是门都没有的事。但你却自作聪明地推论，认为适用于兄弟的规矩并不适用于外族男子；你还自欺欺人，相信这么薄弱的理由就能解除她的心防。她顺应了你的心意，虽然这对她内心的宁静造成莫大伤害。最后，你开口要那本典籍。倘若轻易便交给你，有可能引起你的疑心，所以她假装有一种违常的欲望，只有你才能满足她。我们绝不会忘记她的自我牺牲。外族男子，我认为你仍保有那本典籍，而且我猜你正带在身上。我能要回来吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sat in bitter silence.</p><p>谢顿沉默地呆坐在那里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteens wrinkled hand remained obtrusively outstretched and he said, "How much better it would be than to wrest it from you by force."</p><p>日主十四早已大剌剌地伸出布满皱纹的手。他说：“这比从你手中强行夺走好了多少？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Seldon handed it over.</p><p>谢顿交出那本书。日主十四随便翻了翻，仿佛要确定它并未受损。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen leafed through its pages briefly, as though to reassure himself it was unharmed. He said with a small sigh, "It will have to be carefully destroyed in the approved manner. Sad……But once you had this Book, we were, of course, not surprised when you made your way out to the Sacratorium. You were watched at all times, for you cannot think that any Brother or Sister, not totally absorbed, would not recognize you for tribespeople at a glance. We know a skincap when we see one and there are less than seventy of them in Mycogen……almost all belonging to tribesmen on official business who remain entirely in secular governmental buildings during the time they are here. So you were not only seen but unmistakably identified, over and over.</p><p>他轻轻叹了一声，又说：“必须以认可的方式谨慎销毁。可悲啊！不过，一旦让你拿到这本典籍，当你们启程前往圣堂的时候，我们当然不会惊讶。你们随时随地受到监视，因为，你该不会认为有任何兄弟或姐妹，除非心无旁骛，无法一眼就认出你们是外族人吧。我们看到人皮帽时，立刻就能分辨出来，而且在整个麦曲生，发出去的人皮帽还不到七十顶……几乎都是发给前来洽公的外族男子，而他们在停留期间，自始至终都留在世俗的政府建筑内。所以你们不只被人看见，而且总是一次又一次被正确无误地指认。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The elderly Brother who met you was careful to tell you about the library as well as about the Sacratorium, but he was also careful to tell you what you were forbidden to do, for we did not wish to entrap you. Skystrip Two also warned you……and quite forcibly. Nevertheless, you did not turn away.</p><p>“那位和你们不期而遇的年长兄弟，并没有忘记告诉你们有关图书馆和圣堂的一切，但他也不忘告诉你们什么事是不能做的，因为我们并不希望诱捕你们。天纹二也警告过你们……以强而有力的方式。纵然如此，你们却并未打消念头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The shop at which you bought the white kirtle and the two saShe's informed us at once and from that we knew well what you intended. The library was kept empty, the librarian was warned to keep his eyes to himself, the Sacratorium was kept under-utilized. The one Brother who inadvertently spoke to you almost gave it away, but hastened off when he realized with whom he was dealing. And then you came up here.</p><p>“卖给你们白色裰服和两条肩带的那家商店，在第一时间就向我们通报，而根据这个情报，我们对你们的企图了若指掌。图书馆故意撤空，馆员也事先接到指示，要对你们不闻不问，而圣堂则保持低度使用的状态。那位一时不察而和你攀谈的兄弟，险些让我们的计谋曝光，但在了解到面对的是谁之后，他连忙离去。然后，你们便来到这里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You see, then, that it was your intention to come up here and that we in no way lured you here. You came as a result of your own action, your own desire, and what I want to ask you……yet once again……is: Why?"</p><p>“所以你看，来到这里是你们的本意，我们根本没有引诱你们。是你们自己的行动、自己的渴望带你们来的。而我想要问你们……再问一次的，还是：为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was Dors who answered this time, her voice firm, her eyes hard. "We will tell you yet once again, Mycogenian. We are scholars, who consider knowledge sacred and it is only knowledge that we seek. You did not lure us here, but you did not stop us either, as you might have done before ever we approached this building. You smoothed our way and made it easy for us and even that might be considered a lure. And what harm have we done? We have in no way disturbed the building, or this room, or you, or that."</p><p>这回轮到铎丝回答，她的语气坚定而目光严厉。“麦曲生人，我们则要再一次告诉你，我们是学者，我们认为知识是神圣的，而且是我们唯一的目标。你未曾引诱我们来到此地，可是你也没有阻止我们，而在我们接近这座建筑之前，你早就能那样做了。反之，你替我们开路，让我们通行无阻，这也可以视为一种引诱。而我们造成了什么损害吗？我们完全没有侵扰这座建筑物，或是这间房间，或是你这个人，或是那玩意！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She pointed to the robot. "It is a dead lump of metal that you hide here and we now know that it is dead and that is all the knowledge we sought. We thought it would be more significant and we are disappointed, but now that we know it is merely what it is, we will leave……and, if you wish, we will leave Mycogen as well."</p><p>她指了指那个机器人。“你们藏在这里的是一堆破铜烂铁，现在我们知道它是死的，我们寻求的知识也到此为止。我们本来以为它十分重要，可是我们失望了。既然我们知道它不过如此，我们马上就走……若是你希望，我们还会马上离开麦曲生。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen listened with no trace of expression on his face, but when she was done, he addressed Seldon, saying, "This robot, as you see it, is a symbol, a symbol of all we have lost and of all we no longer have, of all that, through thousands of years, we have not forgotten and what we intend someday to return to. Because it is all that remains to us that is both material and authentic, it is dear to us……yet to your woman it is only a dead lump of metal. Do you associate yourself with that judgment, Tribesman Seldon?"</p><p>聆听这番话的时候，日主十四脸上没有丝毫表情，但是当她说完之后，他却对谢顿说：“你见到的这个机仆是个象征，它象征着我们失落的一切、我们不再拥有的一切，也象征着上万年来我们未曾遗忘、总有一天将要收复的一切。如今还在我们身边的，只剩下这一件既具体又可信的遗物，因此在我们眼中异常珍贵。可是对你的女人而言，它却只是‘一堆破铜烂铁’。外族男子谢顿，你自己认同这个评价吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "We are members of societies that do not tie ourselves to a past that is thousands of years old, making no contact at all with what has existed between that past and ourselves. We live in the present, which we recognize as the product of all the past and not of one long-gone moment of time that we hug to our chests. We realize, intellectually, what the robot may mean to you and we are willing to let it continue to mean that to you. But we can only see it with our own eyes, as you can only see it with yours. To us, it is a dead lump of metal."</p><p>谢顿说：“我们两人所属的社会，并未将自己和上万年之久的过去捆在一起，也并不碰触那个过去和我们之间曾经存在的一切。我们生活在现在，将它视为‘所有的过去’之总和，我们并未紧紧拥抱某个特定的久远年代。理智上，我们了解这个机仆对你们的意义，我们愿意让它继续具有这样的意义。但是我们只能用自己的眼光看它，正如你只能用你自己的眼光看它一样。对我们而言，它就是一堆破铜烂铁。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And now," said Dors, "we will leave."</p><p>“现在，”铎丝说，“我们要走了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You will not," said Sunmaster Fourteen. "By coming here, you have committed a crime. It is a crime only in our eyes, as you will hasten to point out"……his lips curved in a wintry smile……"but this is our territory and, within it, we make the definitions. And this crime, as we define it, is punishable by death."</p><p>“你们不能走。”日主十四说，“你们来到这里，就是犯了罪。这是只存在于我们眼中的罪行，我知道你马上会指出这一点。”他的嘴角弯出一个冷冰冰的笑容，“但这里是我们的领土，在这个范围内，一切由我们来定义。而在我们的定义中，这是一项应当处死的重罪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you are going to shoot us down?" said Dors haughtily.</p><p>“你准备射杀我们吗？”铎丝以倨傲的口气说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteens expression was one of contempt and he continued to speak only to Seldon. "What do you think we are, Tribesman Seldon? Our culture is as old as yours, as complex, as civilized, as humane. I am not armed. You will be tried and, since you are manifestly guilty, executed according to law, quickly and painlessly.</p><p>日主十四露出轻蔑的表情，继续只对谢顿一个人说话。“外族男子谢顿，你以为我们是什么人？我们的文化和你们的同样古老，而且也同样繁复、同样文明、同样人道。我并没有携带武器。你们将会接受审判，而由于罪证确凿，你们注定将被依法处决，既利落又毫无痛苦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you were to try to leave now, I would not stop you, but there are many Brothers below, many more than there appeared to be when you entered the Sacratorium and, in their rage at your action, they may lay rough and forceful hands on you. It has happened in our history that tribespeople have even died so and it is not a pleasant death……certainly not a painless one."</p><p>“假如现在你们试图逃离，我不会阻止你们，但是下面等着很多兄弟，比你们进圣堂时见到的要多得多。你们的行为令他们愤慨，所以他们也许会对你们动粗，下手绝不留情。在我们的历史上，的确有外族人死在这种情况下的例子。那并非一种愉快的死法……绝不是毫无痛苦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We were warned of this," said Dors, "by Skystrip Two. So much for your complex, civilized, and humane culture."</p><p>“我们听过这种警告，”铎丝道，“天纹二说的。好一个繁复、文明又人道的文化。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"People can be moved to violence at moments of emotion, Tribesman Seldon," said Sunmaster Fourteen calmly, "whatever their humanity in moments of calm. This is true in every culture, as your woman, who is said to be a historian, must surely know."</p><p>“外族男子谢顿，不论民众在冷静的时候，具有何种人道胸怀，”日主十四冷静地说，“在情绪激动的时候，他们都能被煽动成暴力分子。在各个文化中通通一样，你的女人据说是个历史学家，这点她一定明白。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Let us remain reasonable, Sunmaster Fourteen. You may be the law in Mycogen over local affairs, but you are not the law over us and you know it. We are both non-Mycogenian citizens of the Empire and it is the Emperor and his designated legal officers who must remain in charge of any capital offense."</p><p>谢顿说：“日主十四，让我们保持理智。在地方性事务上，你也许就是麦曲生的法律，但你并非我们的法律，而你也心知肚明。我们两人都不是麦曲生人，而是银河帝国的公民，即使犯了死罪，也该交由大帝或是他任命的司法官员定夺。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, "That may be so in statutes and on papers and on holovision screens, but we are not talking theory now. The High Elder has long had the power to punish crimes of sacrilege without interference from the Imperial throne."</p><p>日主十四说：“在法令上、文件上，甚至全息电视荧幕上或许都是这样，但我们现在可不是在谈理论。长久以来，元老一向都有权力惩处亵渎罪，从未受到皇权干涉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If the criminals are your own people," said Seldon. "It would be quite different if they were outsiders."</p><p>“前提是，罪犯是你们自己的同胞。”谢顿说，“如果是外人，情况就大大不同。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I doubt it in this case. Tribesman Hummin brought you here as fugitives and we are not so yeast-headed in Mycogen that we don't strongly suspect that you are fugitives from the Emperors laws. Why should he object if we do his work for him?"</p><p>“就本案而言，我表示存疑。外族男子夫铭把你们当逃犯一样送来这里，我们麦曲生人脑袋里装的可不是发粉，自然深深怀疑你们是在逃避皇帝的法律。如果由我们代劳，他为什么要反对呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because," said Seldon, "he would. Even if we were fugitives from the Imperial authorities and even if he wanted us only to punish us, he would still want us. To allow you to kill, by whatever means and for whatever reason, non-Mycogenians without due Imperial process would be to defy his authority and no Emperor could allow such a precedent. No matter how eager he might be to see that the microfood trade not be interrupted, he would still feel it necessary to re-establish the Imperial prerogative. Do you wish, in your eagerness to kill us, to have a division of Imperial soldiery loot your farms and your dwellings, desecrate your Sacratorium, and take liberties with the Sisters: Consider."</p><p>“因为他一定会。”谢顿说，“即使我们是钦命要犯；即使他要抓我们回去，只是为了惩罚我们，他仍然会想要将我们生擒。无论用什么方式，无论为了什么理由，只要是未经帝国的法律程序而让你杀掉一个非麦曲生人，都等于在挑战他的权威，没有哪位皇帝敢开这种先例。不论他多么希望微生食品的贸易不受干扰，他仍然会觉得有必要重建皇帝的权威。难道你希望，由于你逞一时之快杀了我们，因而招来一师帝国军队，掠夺你们的农场和住所，亵渎你们的圣堂，并且非礼你们的姐妹？请三思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen smiled once again, but displayed no softness. "Actually, I have considered and there is an alternative. After we condemn you, we could delay your execution to allow you to appeal to the Emperor for a review of your case. The Emperor might be grateful at this evidence of our ready submission to his authority and grateful too to lay his hands on you two……for some reason of his own……and Mycogen might profit. Is that what you want, then? To appeal to the Emperor in due course and to be delivered to him?"</p><p>日主十四再度露出笑容，却并未显得软化。“事实上，我三思过了，的确另有一个选择。在我们将你俩定罪后，我们可以延缓死刑的执行，允许你们向大帝提出上诉，要求重审你们的案子。如此不但证明了我们臣服于他的权威之下，同时也把你们交到了他手中，大帝也许因此圣心大悦，而麦曲生便可能受惠。所以说，这就是你想要的吗？找机会向大帝提出上诉，然后被解送到他那里去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon and Dors looked at each other briefly and were silent.</p><p>谢顿与铎丝很快互望了一眼，两人都没吭声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, "I feel you would rather be delivered to the Emperor than die, but why do I get the impression that the preference is only by a slight margin?"</p><p>日主十四说：“我觉得你们宁愿被解送给大帝，也不愿死在这里。可是为什么我会有一种印象，这两者的差别仅仅微乎其微？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Actually," said a new voice, "I think neither alternative is acceptable and that we must search for a third."</p><p>“其实，”一个新的声音说，“我认为这两种选择都无法令人接受，我们必须找出第三条路。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was Dors who identified the newcomer first, perhaps because it was she who expected him.</p><p>铎丝第一个认出来者的身份，或许因为她一直在期盼他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hummin," she said, "thank goodness you found us. I got in touch with you the moment I realized I was not going to deflect Hari from"……she held up her hands in a wide gesture "this."</p><p>“夫铭，”她说，“谢天谢地，你总算找到我们了。我和你联络的时候，已经了解到我无法让哈里避免这……”她夸张地举起双手，“一切。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummins smile was a small one that did not alter the natural gravity of his face. There was a subtle weariness about him.</p><p>夫铭露出浅浅的微笑，却无法改变他天生的严肃神情。此外，他似乎带着一股不甚明显的倦意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My dear," he said, "I was engaged in other things. I cannot always pull away at a moments notice. And when I got here, I had, like you two, to supply myself with a kirtle and sash, to say nothing of a skincap, and make my way out here. Had I been here earlier, I might have stopped this, but I believe Im not too late."</p><p>“亲爱的，”他说，“我正在忙别的事，无法总是随传随到。当我抵达此地之后，我还得像你们两人一样，先穿戴上裰服和肩带，人皮帽就更不用说了，然后才能赶来这里。要是来早了一点，我也许能阻止这一切，但我相信我来得并不算迟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen had recovered from what had seemed to be a painful shock. He said in a voice that lacked its customary severe depth, "How did you get in here, Tribesman Hummin?"</p><p>日主十四似乎陷入一阵痛苦的错愕中，而在终于恢复之后，他以不再那么严肃深沉的语调说：“外族男子夫铭，你是怎么进来的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was not easy, High Elder, but as Tribeswoman Venabili likes to say, I am a very persuasive person. Some of the citizens here remember who I was and what I have done for Mycogen in the past, that I am even an honorary Brother. Have you forgotten, Sunmaster Fourteen?"</p><p>“并不容易，元老，但正如外族女子凡纳比里常说的，我这个人非常有说服力。这里有些居民还记得我是谁，我曾经为麦曲生做过些什么，还有我甚至是一位荣誉兄弟。日主十四，你忘记了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Elder replied, "I have not forgotten, but even the most favorable memory can not survive certain actions. A tribesman here and a tribeswoman. There is no greater crime. All you have done is not great enough to balance that. My people are not unmindful. We will make it up to you some other way. But these two must die or be handed over to the Emperor."</p><p>元老答道：“我并没有忘记，但即使最美好的记忆，也经不起某些行动的冲击。一个外族男子竟然来到这里，还带了一个外族女子。再也没有比这更严重的罪行了，你为我们所做的一切也不够抵销。我的人民绝非忘恩负义之辈，我们会用别的方式补偿你。可是这两个必须受死，或是解送给大帝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am also here," said Hummin calmly. "Is that not a crime as well?"</p><p>“我也来了，”夫铭以平静的口吻说，“不也是犯了同样的罪吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For you," said Sunmaster Fourteen, "for you personally, as a kind of honorary Brother, I can……overlook it……once. Not these two."</p><p>“对你而言，”日主十四说，“对你个人而言，你是一位荣誉兄弟，我可以……宽容……一次。这两个却不行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because you expect a reward from the Emperor? Some favor? Some concession? Have you already been in touch with him or with his Chief of Staff, Eto Demerzel, more likely?"</p><p>“因为你指望大帝的奖赏？某种好处？某种特权？你已经和他接触了吗？或者更有可能的情形，和他的行政首长伊图·丹莫刺尔联络上了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That is not a subject for discussion."</p><p>“这不是现在应该讨论的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Which is itself an admission. Come on, I don't ask what the Emperor promised, but it cannot be much. He does not have much to give in these degenerate days. Let me make you an offer. Have these two told you they are scholars?"</p><p>“这句话本身就等于承认。好啦，我不问你大帝答应了什么，但绝不可能太多。在这个衰微的年代，他没有太多能给你的。我来向你提个条件，这两位有没有告诉你说他们是学者？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They have."</p><p>“说过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And they are. They are not lying. The tribeswoman is a historian and the tribesman is a mathematician. The two together are trying to combine their talents to make a mathematics of history and they call the combined subject psychohistory. "</p><p>“这是真的，他们不是在说谎。这位外族女子是历史学家，这位外族男子是数学家。他们正试图联合两人的才智，创造一套能够处理历史的数学，他们将这个合作题目称为‘心理史学’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sunmaster Fourteen said, "I know nothing about this psychohistory, nor do I care to know. Neither it nor any other facet of your tribal learning interests me."</p><p>日主十四说：“我对这个心理史学一无所知，也不想知道。你们外族人的学问，我一概没兴趣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nevertheless," said Hummin, "I suggest that you listen to me."</p><p>“纵使如此，”夫铭道，“我建议你还是听我说一说。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It took Hummin some fifteen minutes, speaking concisely, to describe the possibility of organizing the natural laws of society (something he always mentioned with audible quotation marks in the tone of his voice) in such a way as to make it possible to anticipate the future with a substantial degree of probability.</p><p>夫铭大约花了十五分钟，以精简的语言描述心理史学的可能性……将社会的定律组织起来（每当提到这些定律时，他总会改变语调，让人一听就知道有“引号”存在），并在大量借助几率的前提下，使得预测未来变成可能。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And when he was done, Sunmaster Fourteen, who had listened expressionlessly, said, "A highly unlikely piece of speculation, I should say."</p><p>等他讲完后，一直面无表情地聆听的日主十四说：“我认为，这是极其不可能的臆想。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon, with a rueful expression, seemed about to speak, undoubtedly to agree, but Hummins hand, resting lightly on the others knee, tightened unmistakably.</p><p>满面愁容的谢顿似乎有话要说，无疑是要表示同意。但夫铭原先轻放在谢顿膝上的一只手，此时却突然收紧，用意至为明显。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "Possibly, High Elder, but the Emperor doesnt think so. And by the Emperor, who is himself an amiable enough personage, I really mean Demerzel, concerning whose ambitions you need no instruction. They would like very much to have these two scholars, which is why Ive brought them here for safekeeping. I had little expectation that you would do Demerzels work for him by delivering the scholars to him."</p><p>夫铭说：“元老，可能性是有的，但大帝却不这么想。话说回来，大帝本人是个相当敦厚的人物，我指的其实是丹莫刺尔，他的野心不必由我来告诉你。他们非常希望得到这两位学者，这正是我送他俩来这里避难的原因。我不相信你会为丹莫刺尔工作，要将这两位学者送到他手上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They have committed a crime that……"</p><p>“他们犯了一项重罪……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, we know, High Elder, but it is only a crime because you choose to call it so. No real harm has been done."</p><p>“没错，元老，我们知道。可是这项罪名之所以成立，只是因为你要如此认定。事实上，并没有任何实质的伤害。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It has been done to our belief, to our deepest felt……"</p><p>“它对我们的信仰造成伤害，也对我们内心最深的感情……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But imagine what harm will be done if psychohistory falls into the hands of Demerzel. Yes, I grant that nothing may come of it, but suppose for a moment that something does and that the Imperial government has the use of it……can foretell what is to come……can take measures with that foreknowledge which no one else would have……can take measures, in fact, designed to bring about an alternate future more to the Imperial liking."</p><p>“可是想想看，假如心理史学落入丹莫刺尔之手，又会造成什么样的伤害。没错，我承认也许不会有什么结果，但是姑且假设真有了结果，而帝国政府又善加利用……能够预测未来会发生什么事；能够掌握独一无二的先见之明，并在它的指导下采取对策。事实上，他们所采取的对策，必将是营造一个帝制更加中意的未来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well?"</p><p>“那又如何？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is there any doubt, High Elder, that the alternate future more to the Imperial liking would be one of tightened centralization? For centuries now, as you very well know, the Empire has been undergoing a steady decentralization. Many worlds now acknowledge only lip service to the Emperor and virtually rule themselves. Even here on Trantor, there is decentralization. Mycogen, as only one example, is free of Imperial interference for the most part. You rule its High Elder and there is no Imperial officer at your side overseeing your actions and decisions. How long do you think that will last with men like Demerzel adjusting the future to their liking?"</p><p>“帝制更加中意的未来势必是极度中央集权，元老，这还有什么疑问吗？过去数世纪以来，你也非常清楚，帝国一直在稳定地朝地方分权发展。如今，许多世界只在口头上承认大帝，实际上则在实行自治。甚至在川陀，也有地方分权的事实。麦曲生大部分的事务都不受皇权干涉，只是其中一个例子。你以元老的身份实行统治，没有帝国官员在旁边监督你的行动和决策。假如丹莫刺尔那种人能依照他们的喜好调整未来，你认为这种局面还能维持多久？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Still the flimsiest of speculation," said Sunmaster Fourteen, "but a disturbing one, I admit."</p><p>“仍然是最缺乏根据的臆测，”日主十四说，“但我必须承认，听来令人不安。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On the other hand, if these scholars can complete their task, an unlikely if, you might say, but an if……then they are sure to remember that you spared them when you might have chosen not to. And it would then be conceivable that they would learn to arrange a future, for instance, that would allow Mycogen to be given a world of its own, a world that could be terraformed into a close replica of the Lost World. And even if these two forget your kindness, I will be here to remind them."</p><p>“另一方面，假设这两位学者能完成他们的工作，你也许会说可能性不高，但我只是做个假设……那么他们一定会记得，你曾经在一番内心交战后，对他们网开一面。然后我们就不难想见，他们会研究出如何安排一个未来，比如说，能让麦曲生得到一个自己的世界，一个能改造成和‘失落世界’极为相似的世界。即使这两位忘了你的恩德，我也会从旁提醒他们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well……" said Sunmaster Fourteen.</p><p>“这……”日主十四支吾着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come on," said Hummin, "it is not hard to decide what must be going through your mind. Of all tribespeople, you must trust Demerzel the least. And though the chance of psychohistory might be small (if I was not being honest with you, I would not admit that) it is not zero; and if it will bring about a restoration of the Lost World, what can you want more than that? What would you not risk for even a tiny chance of that? Come now……I promise you and my promises are not lightly given. Release these two and choose a tiny chance of your hearts desire over no chance at all."</p><p>“好啦，”夫铭说，“你心里究竟在怎么想，实在不难猜到。在所有的外族人当中，你最不相信的一定是丹莫刺尔。虽然心理史学成功的机会或许不大（若非我对你诚实，我也不会承认这一点），但是并不等于零；假如它能帮助你们重建失落世界，你又夫复何求？难道你不愿意为这件事冒一丝风险吗？好啦……我从不轻易承诺任何事，但我现在向你承诺。把这两位放了，为你内心的愿望保留一点机会，总比全然无望要好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was silence and then Sunmaster Fourteen sighed. "I don't know how it is, Tribesman Hummin, but on every occasion that we meet, you persuade me into something I do not really want to do."</p><p>一阵沉默后，日主十四叹了一声。“我真不明白，外族男子夫铭，可是我们每次见面，你总会说服我做些并非真正心甘情愿的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have I ever misled you, High Elder?"</p><p>“元老，我曾经误导过你吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have never offered me so small a chance?"</p><p>“你提供的胜算从来没那么小。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And so high a possible reward. The one balances the other."</p><p>“可能的报偿却那么高，所以两者扯平了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Sunmaster Fourteen nodded his head. "You are right. Take these two and take them out of Mycogen and never let me see them again unless there comes a time when……But surely it will not be in my lifetime."</p><p>日主十四点了点头。“你说得没错。把这两个带走，带他们离开麦曲生，永远不要让我再见到他们。除非有一天……但绝不是在我有生之年。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps not, High Elder. But your people have been waiting patiently for nearly twenty thousand years. Would you then object to waiting another……perhaps……two hundred?"</p><p>“或许吧，元老，可是你的族人已经耐心等待了近两万年。难道你们拒绝再等上……也许两百年？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I would not willingly wait one moment, but my people will wait as long as they must."</p><p>“我自己一刻也不愿再等，但不论需要多少时间，我的族人都会等下去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And standing up, he said, "I will clear the path. Take them and go."</p><p>他一面起身，一面说道：“我会叫人让开，带他们走吧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Chapter 60</p><p>60</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were finally back in a tunnel. Hummin and Seldon had traveled through one when they went from the Imperial Sector to Streeling University in the air-taxi. Now they were in another tunnel, going from Mycogen to……Seldon did not know where. He hesitated to ask. Hummins face seemed as if it was carved out of granite and it didn't welcome conversation.</p><p>他们终于来到一条隧道。当初，夫铭与谢顿驾着出租飞车，从皇区前往斯璀璘大学时，就曾经穿越过这样一条隧道。如今他们则置身于另一条隧道，从麦曲生前往……谢顿不知道要去哪里，也不太敢开口发问。夫铭的脸庞像是花岗岩雕出来的，看来绝不欢迎交谈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin sat in the front of the four-seater, with no one to his right. Seldon and Dors shared the backseat.</p><p>夫铭坐在这辆四座飞车的前座，他右边的座位是空的，谢顿与铎丝则分坐在后座两侧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon chanced a smile at Dors, who looked glum. "Its nice to be in real clothes again, isn't  it?"</p><p>谢顿对闷闷不乐的铎丝试探性地笑了笑。“能再穿上真正的衣服真好，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I will never," said Dors with enormous sincerity, "wear or look at anything that resembles a kirtle. And I will never, under any circumstances, wear a skincap. In fact, Im going to feel odd if I ever see a normally bald man." </p><p>“我再也不要穿上或看到任何像裰服的东西。”铎丝以极其正经的口吻说，“而且不论在任何情况下，我都绝对不要再戴上人皮帽。事实上，即使再看到一个普通的秃子，我都会有一种奇怪的感觉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And it was Dors who finally asked the question that Seldon had been reluctant to advance. "Chetter," she said rather petulantly, "why wont you tell us where were going?"</p><p>那个谢顿一直不愿提出的问题，最后是由铎丝问了出来。“契特，”她以颇为暴躁的口气说，“你怎么不告诉我们要到哪里去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin hitched himself into a sideways position and he looked back at Dors and Seldon gravely. "Somewhere," he said, "where it may be difficult for you to get into trouble……although Im not sure such a place exists."</p><p>夫铭挪到座位一侧，然后回过头来，以严肃的表情望着铎丝与谢顿。“反正是到某处去，”他说，“到一个你们或许不容易惹麻烦的地方……虽然我不确定这种地方是否存在。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors was at once crestfallen. "Actually, Chetter, its my fault. At Streeling, I let Hari go Upperside without accompanying him. In Mycogen, I at least accompanied him, but I suppose I ought not to have let him enter the Sacratorium at all."</p><p>铎丝立刻像是斗败了的公鸡。“事实上，契特，这都是我的错。在斯璀璘的时候，我让哈里一个人到上方去。而在麦曲生，我至少陪着他一起冒险，可是我想，当初我根本就不该让他进入圣堂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I was determined," said Seldon warmly. "It was in no way Dorss fault."</p><p>“我当时心意已决，”谢顿热切地说，“那绝不是铎丝的错。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin made no effort to apportion blame. He simply said, "I gather you wanted to see the robot. Was there a reason for that? Can you tell me?"</p><p>夫铭并未评断两人分别该受多少责难，他只是说：“我猜你是想去看那个机器人。你有没有一个好理由？能告诉我吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon could feel himself redden. "I was wrong in that respect, Hummin. I did not see what I expected to see or what I hoped to see. If I had known the content of the aerie, I would never have bothered going there. Call it a complete fiasco."</p><p>谢顿感到自己脸红了。“这件事是我的错，夫铭，我并未见到我所预期或是希望见到的东西。倘若事先知道长老阁里有些什么，我绝对懒得到那里去。真可说是完全一败涂地。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But then, Seldon, what was it you hoped to see? Please tell me. Take your time if you wish. This is a long trip and I am willing to listen."</p><p>“可是，谢顿，你希望见到的又是什么呢？请告诉我。你不妨慢慢说，这是一趟长途旅行，我愿意洗耳恭听。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The thing is, Hummin, that I had the idea that there were humaniform robots, that they were long-lived, that at least one might still be alive, and that it might be in the aerie. There was a robot there, but it was metallic, it was dead, and it was merely a symbol. Had I but known……"</p><p>“事情是这样的，夫铭，我有个想法，此地藏着一些人形机器人，它们的寿命很长，至少有一个可能还活着，而且可能就在长老阁中。事实则是，那里的确有个机器人，但它是金属制品，已经死了，仅仅是一种象征。我要是早知道……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Did we all but know, there would be no need for questions or for research of any kind. Where did you get your information about humaniform robots? Since no Mycogenian would have discussed that with you, I can think of only one source. The Mycogenian Book……a powered print-book in ancient Auroran and modern Galactic. Am I right?"</p><p>“没错，我们要是都能早知道，任何种类的问题或研究便一概没有必要。有关人形机器人的资料，你是从哪里获得的？既然麦曲生人不会和你讨论这种事，我只能想到一个来源，那就是麦曲生的典籍……古奥罗拉语和银河标准语对照的电动字体书。我说对了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes."</p><p>“对了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And how did you get a copy?"</p><p>“你是怎么拿到的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon paused, then muttered, "Its somewhat embarrassing."</p><p>顿了一下之后，谢顿咕哝道：“这件事有些令人脸红。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am not easily embarrassed, Seldon."</p><p>“谢顿，我可没那么容易脸红。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon told him and Hummin allowed a very small smile to twitch across his face.</p><p>于是谢顿一五一十告诉了他。夫铭听完，脸上掠过一丝很淡的笑容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "Didnt it occur to you that what occurred had to be a charade? No Sister would do a thing like that……except under instruction and with a great deal of persuading."</p><p>夫铭说：“难道你就没有想到，这必定是个哑谜游戏？没有哪个姐妹会做那种事……除非是奉命，而且经过极力劝说。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon frowned and said with asperity, "That was not at all obvious. People are perverted now and then. And its easy for you to grin. I didn't have the information you had and neither did Dors. If you did not wish me to fall into traps, you might have warned me of those that existed."</p><p>谢顿皱着眉头，凶巴巴地说：“这绝非显而易见的线索，人们随时随地会有违常的举动。你咧嘴笑笑倒很容易，我可没有你所掌握的情报，而铎丝也不知道。倘若你不希望我落入陷阱，就该事先警告我哪里有圈套。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I agree. I withdraw my remark. In any case, you don't have the Book any longer, Im sure."</p><p>“我同意，我收回刚才的话。无论如何，那本典籍已经不在你身上，我可以肯定。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. Sunmaster Fourteen took it from me."</p><p>“没错，日主十四把它拿走了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How much of it did you read?"</p><p>“你读了多少内容？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Only a small fraction. I didn't have time. Its a huge book and I must tell you, Hummin, it is dreadfully dull."</p><p>“只有一小部分，我没有多少时间。那是一本大书，而且我一定要告诉你，夫铭，它实在无聊极了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I know that, for I think I have read more of it than you have. It is not only dull, it is totally unreliable. It is a one-sided, official Mycogenian view of history that is more intent on presenting that view than a reasoned objectivity. It is even deliberately unclear in spots so that outsiders……even if they were to read the Book……would never know entirely what they read. What was it, for instance, that you thought you read about robots that interested you?"</p><p>“没错，这我知道，因为我想我比你还要熟悉这本书。它不只无聊，而且完全不足采信。它是麦曲生官方片面的历史观，主要目的也正是为了阐扬那个史观，而不是提出理性客观的论述。它在某些地方甚至故意语焉不详，好让外人即使有机会读到这本典籍，也绝对无法完全了解它的内容。比方说，令你感兴趣的那些有关机器人的记载，你认为究竟是在说些什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ive already told you. They speak of humaniform robots, robots that could not be distinguished from human beings in outward appearance."</p><p>“我已经告诉过你。他们提到人形机器人，这些机器人外表上和真人一模一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How many of these would exist?" asked Hummin. </p><p>“这样的机器人总共有多少？”夫铭问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They don't say……At least, I didn't come across a passage in which they gave numbers. There may have been only a handful, but one of them, the Book refers to as Renegade. It seems to have an unpleasant significance, but I couldnt make out what.</p><p>“他们没有说。至少，我没发现书里有哪一段记载着数量。也许为数不多，但是其中有一个，典籍中特别称之为‘变节者’。它似乎具有负面意义，但我查不出是什么意思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>You didn't tell me anything about that, interposed Dors. "If you had, I would have told you that its not a proper name. Its another archaic word and it means, roughly, what traitor would mean in Galactic. The older word has a greater aura of fear about it. A traitor, somehow, sneaks to his treason, but a renegade flaunts it."</p><p>“你完全没有跟我提这件事，”铎丝插嘴道，“假如你说了，我就会告诉你它并非专有名词，而是另一个古老的词汇，意思接近银河标准语中的‘叛徒’。但这个古词具有更可怕的意味：叛徒对叛变行径多少还会遮掩，变节者却会大肆夸耀。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "Ill leave the fine points of archaic language to you, Dors, but, in any case, if the Renegade actually existed and if it was a humaniform robot, then, clearly, as a traitor and enemy, it would not be preserved and venerated in the Elders aerie."</p><p>夫铭说：“我把古代语文的细节留给你来研究，铎丝。不过无论如何，假如那个变节者果真存在，而且是个人形机器人，那么显而易见的是，身为一名叛徒和敌人，它不会被保存和供奉在长老阁内。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I didn't know the meaning of Renegade, but, as I said, I did get the impression that it was an enemy. I thought it might have been defeated and preserved as a reminder of the Mycogenian triumph."</p><p>谢顿说：“我原本不知道变节者的意义，但正如我所说，我的确有一种它是敌非友的印象。我想它后来可能被打败了，将它保存下来是为了纪念麦曲生的胜利。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Was there any indication in the Book that the Renegade was defeated?"</p><p>“典籍中曾经提到变节者被打败了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, but I might have missed that portion……"</p><p>“没有，但也许是我漏读了那一部分……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not likely. Any Mycogenian victory would be announced in the Book unmistakably and referred to over and over again."</p><p>“不太可能。凡是麦曲生的胜利，必定会在典籍中大肆宣扬，而且会不厌其烦地一提再提。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There was another point the Book made about the Renegade," said Seldon, hesitating, "but I cant be at all sure I understood it." </p><p>“关于这个变节者，典籍中还提到另外一点，”谢顿以迟疑的口气说，“但我不敢保证我看懂了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "As I told you……They are deliberately obscure at times."</p><p>夫铭道：“正如我说的……他们有时故意含糊其词。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nevertheless, they seemed to say that the Renegade could somehow tap human emotions……influence them……"</p><p>“然而，他们似乎提到，那个变节者好像有办法利用人类的情感……还能影响人类……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Any politician can," said Hummin with a shrug. "Its called charisma……when it works."</p><p>“任何政治人物都能。”夫铭耸了耸肩，“一旦奏效，就可以叫做领袖魅力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sighed. "Well, I wanted to believe. That was it. I would have given a great deal to find an ancient humaniform robot that was still alive and that I could question."</p><p>谢顿叹了一声。“嗯，我偏偏相信了，事情就是这样。当时，为了找到一个古代的人形机器人，我情愿付出很高的代价，只要它还活着，而且我能向它发问。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For what purpose?" asked Hummin.</p><p>“为了什么目的？”夫铭问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To learn the details of the primordial Galactic society when it still consisted of only a handful of worlds. From so small a Galaxy psychohistory could be deduced more easily."</p><p>“我想了解太初银河社会的细节。当时只有少数几个世界，从这么小的一个社会中，心理史学比较容易推导出来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "Are you sure you could trust what you heard? After many thousands of years, would you be willing to rely on the robots early memories? How much distortion would have entered into them?"</p><p>夫铭道：“你确定道听途说的事能信吗？经过上万年的时间，你还愿意信赖那个机器人的早期记忆？那里面会有多少的扭曲？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thats right," said Dors suddenly. "It would be like the computerized records I told you of, Hari. Slowly, those robot memories would be discarded, lost, erased, distorted. You can only go back so far and the farther you go back, the less reliable the information becomes……no matter what you do."</p><p>“很有道理。”铎丝突然说，“哈里，这就像我跟你提过的那些电脑化记录。日久天长，机器人的记忆会逐渐被抛弃、遗失、清除、扭曲。你只能追溯到某个限度，而且愈往前追溯，那些资料就变得愈不可靠……不论你怎么努力都没用。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin nodded. "Ive heard it referred to as a kind of uncertainty principle in information."</p><p>夫铭点了点头。“我听说有人称之为‘资讯不准原理’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But wouldnt it be possible," said Seldon thoughtfully, "that some information, for special reasons, would be preserved? Parts of the Mycogenian Book may well refer to events of twenty thousand years ago and yet be very largely as it had been originally. The more valued and the more carefully preserved particular information is, the more long-lasting and accurate it may be."</p><p>“难道就没有这个可能，”谢顿若有所思地说，“某些资料由于特别的原因，会一直保存下去？麦曲生典籍的某些部分，很可能是两万年前的事迹，但绝大部分仍是第一手史料。愈是珍贵、愈是谨慎保存的特殊资料，就愈能持久而且愈为正确。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The key word is particular. What the Book may care to preserve may not be what you wish to have preserved and what a robot may remember best may be what you wish him to remember least."</p><p>“关键在于‘特殊’这两个字。那本典籍想要保存的资料，并不一定是你所希望保存的；而一个机器人记得最清楚的事，说不定正是你最不需要它记得的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said in despair, "In whatever direction I turn to seek a way of working out psychohistory, matters so arrange themselves as to make it impossible. Why bother trying?"</p><p>谢顿以绝望的口吻说：“不论我朝哪个方向寻找建立心理史学的方法，到头来总是变得绝无可能。何必再自找麻烦呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It might seem hopeless now," said Hummin unemotionally, "but given the necessary genius, a route to psychohistory may be found that none of us would at this moment expect. Give yourself more time……But were coming to a rest area. Let us pull off and have dinner."</p><p>“现在或许希望渺茫，”夫铭以毫无情绪的语气说，“但只要有必要的天分，也许终能找到一条通往心理史学的大道，而它是此时此刻谁都无法预见的。再多给你自己一些时间……我们马上就要到一个休息区，让我们开出去吃顿晚餐吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Over the lamb patties on rather tasteless bread (most unpalatable after the fare at Mycogen), Seldon said, "You seem to assume, Hummin, that I am the possessor of the necessary genius. I may not be, you know."</p><p>在吃羔羊肉饼的时候（其中的面包平淡无味，尤其在吃惯麦曲生的美食后，更令人觉得难以下咽），谢顿说：“你似乎做了一项假设，夫铭，我就是那个‘必要天分’的来源。你可曾想到，也许不是我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "Thats true. You may not be. However, I know of no alternate candidate for the post, so I must cling to you."</p><p>夫铭说：“这倒是真的，也许并不是你。然而，我不知道还有什么替代人选，所以我必须抓着你不放。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Seldon sighed and said, "Well, Ill try, but Im out of any spark of hope. Possible but not practical, I said to begin with, and Im more convinced of that now than I ever was before."</p><p>谢顿叹了一口气，答道：“好吧，我会试试看，但我已经看不见任何希望的火花。有可能却不切实际，我一开始就这么说，现在我比任何时候更加相信这句话。”</p></div>
