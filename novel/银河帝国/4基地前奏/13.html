<div class='layout'><p>13 Heatsink</p><p>第13章 热闾</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>AMARYL, YUGO:……A mathematician who, next to Hari Seldon himself, may be considered most responsible for working out the details of psychohistory. It was he who ...</p><p>雨果·阿马瑞尔：……数学家，除了哈里·谢顿本人之外，可视为对心理史学具体内容做出最大贡献的一位。正是他……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>... Yet the conditions under which he began life are almost more dramatic than his mathematical accomplishments. Born into the hopeless poverty of the lower classes of Dahl, a sector of ancient Trantor, he might have passed his life in utter obscurity were it not for the fact that Seldon, quite by accident, encountered him in the course of ...</p><p>……但相较于他的数学成就，他的早年境况几乎更为传奇。他生于古川陀的达尔区，出身寒微，属于毫无希望的下层社会。若非谢顿在相当意外的情况下遇到他，终其一生他都可能过着寒微的日子。谢顿当时……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p><p>……《银河百科全书》</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor of all the Galaxy felt weary……physically weary. His lips ached from the gracious smile he had had to place on his face at careful intervals. His neck was stiff from having inclined his head this way and that in a feigned show of interest. His ears pained from having to listen. His whole body throbbed from having to rise and to sit and to turn and to hold out his hand and to nod. </p><p>统治全银河的皇帝感到一股倦意……生理上的倦意。他的嘴唇酸痛，因为他必须在适当时刻将亲切的笑容摆在脸上。他的颈部僵硬，因为他刚才不断以各种角度低下头来，装出一副很感兴趣的样子。由于听觉得不到休息，他的耳朵感到疼痛。由于不得不常常起立、坐下、转身、伸手、点头，他整个身子都累得微微颤抖。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was merely a state function where one had to meet Mayors and Viceroys and Ministers and their wives or husbands from here and there in Trantor and (worse) from here and there in the Galaxy. There were nearly a thousand present, all in costumes that varied from the ornate to the downright outlandish, and he had had to listen to a babble of different accents made the worse by an effort to speak the Emperors Galactic as spoken at the Galactic University. Worst of all, the Emperor had had to remember to avoid making commitments of substance, while freely applying the lotion of words without substance. </p><p>这只不过是一场国宴，但他得接见来自川陀各个角落，还有（更糟的是）来自银河各个角落的众多区长、总督、部长以及他们的妻子或夫君。出席者将近一千人，一律穿着各地的传统服装，从华丽无比到十足怪异应有尽有。此外，他还得忍受各种口音的唠叨，更糟的是他们都在努力模仿帝国大学通用的银河标准语，因为那是皇帝所使用的语言。而最头痛的一件事，莫过于在随口说些毫无内容的空话时，他得牢记避免做出任何实质的许诺。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All had been recorded, sight and sound……very discreetly……and Eto Demerzel would go over it to see if Cleon, First of that Name, had behaved himself. That, of course, was only the way that the Emperor put it to himself. Demerzel would surely say that he was merely collecting data on any unintentional self-revelation on the pan of the guests. And perhaps he was. </p><p>一切都会被非常谨慎地记录下来，包括影像与声音。事后，伊图·丹莫刺尔会从头到尾看一遍，看看克里昂一世是否行止得宜。这一点，当然只是大帝自己的见解。丹莫刺尔一定会说，他只是在搜集客人无意中自行泄露的信息。而这或许是实情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Fortunate Demerzel!</p><p>幸运的丹莫刺尔！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor could not leave the Palace and its extensive grounds, while Demerzel could range the Galaxy if he wished. The Emperor was always on display, always accessible, always forced to deal with visitors, from the important to the merely intrusive. Demerzel remained anonymous and never allowed himself to be seen inside the Palace grounds. He remained merely a fearsome name and an invisible (and therefore the more frightening) presence. </p><p>皇帝不能离开皇宫与外围的御苑，丹莫刺尔却能随心所欲遍巡银河。皇帝总是陈列在皇宫，总是随时候教，总是被迫应酬一些访客……从真正重要的到不速之客都有。丹莫刺尔则始终销声匿迹，从不在御苑之内公开露脸。他只保持着一个令人生畏的名字，以及一个隐形的（因此更为可怕的）存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor was the Inside Man with all the trappings and emoluments of power. Demerzel was the Outside Man, with nothing evident, not even a formal title, but with his fingers and mind probing everywhere and asking for no reward for his tireless labors but one……the reality of power.</p><p>皇帝是权力的核心，享有权力的一切外表与实惠。丹莫刺尔则是权力的糖衣，表面上看来一无所有，甚至没有一个正式的头衔，但他的指掌与心灵却能探寻各个角落。他对自己的孜孜不倦别无所求，仅仅要求权力的本质作为奖赏。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It amused the Emperor……in a macabre sort of way……to consider that, at any moment, without warning, with a manufactured excuse or with none at all, he could have Demerzel arrested, imprisoned, exiled, tortured, or executed. After all, in these annoying centuries of constant unrest, the Emperor might have difficulty in exerting his will over the various planets of the Empire, even over the various sectors of Trantor……with their rabble of local executives and legislatures that he was forced to deal with in a maze of interlocking decrees, protocols, commitments, treaties, and general interstellar legalities……but at least his powers remained absolute over the Palace and its grounds. </p><p>大帝突然有个开心的想法……一种带有死亡气息的开心……无论任何时候，在毫无预警的情况下，或是炮制一个借口，或是什么借口也不用，他都能将丹莫刺尔逮捕、监禁、放逐、严刑拷打或是处决。毕竟，在过去数个动荡不断的世纪里，皇帝或许难以将意志延伸到帝国每颗行星上，甚至想在川陀各区贯彻也难……地方行政机关与立法机关满是乱臣贼子，使他每天必须面对千丝万缕、纠缠不清的无数法令、草案、约定、条约，以及一般性的星际法案。但是，至少在皇宫与御苑范围内，他仍旧拥有绝对的权力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And yet Cleon knew that his dreams of power were useless. Demerzel had served his father and Cleon could not remember a time when he did not turn to Demerzel for everything. It was Demerzel who knew it all, devised it all, did it all. More than that, it was on Demerzel that anything that went wrong could be blamed. The Emperor himself remained above criticism and had nothing to fear……except, of course, palace coups and assassination by his nearest and dearest. </p><p>然而克里昂心知肚明，他的权力美梦根本徒劳无功。丹莫刺尔是父皇的老臣，在克里昂的记忆中，自己遇到问题总是转向丹莫刺尔求助，从来没有例外。了解一切、筹划一切、执行一切的都是丹莫刺尔。更重要的是，任何事情出了问题，都可以怪罪到丹莫刺尔头上。皇帝本人高高在上，永远不受批判，因此毫无畏惧……当然也有例外，那就是担心发生宫廷政变，遭到最亲近的人行刺。而预防这一点，是他仰仗丹莫刺尔最重要的原因。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was to prevent this, above all, that he depended upon Demerzel. Emperor Cleon felt a tiny shudder at the thought of trying to do without Demerzel. There had been Emperors who had ruled personally, who had had a series of Chiefs of Staff of no talent, who had had incompetents serving in the post and had kept them……and somehow they had gotten along for a time and after a fashion.</p><p>除掉丹莫刺尔、自己接掌一切的这个念头，令克里昂大帝全身微微打颤。过去，的确有些皇帝亲自治理帝国，他们的行政首长个个是庸才。他们让无能之辈占着这个职位，从来不想撤换……而在短时间内，他们竟然也能凑合着应付。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Cleon could not. He needed Demerzel. In fact, now that the thought of assassination had come to him……and, in view of the modern history of the Empire, it was inevitable that it had come to him……he could see that getting rid of Demerzel was quite impossible. It couldnt be done. No matter how cleverly he, Cleon, would attempt to arrange it, Demerzel (he was sure) would anticipate the move somehow, would know it was on its way, and would arrange, with far superior cleverness, a palace coup. Cleon would be dead before Demerzel could possibly be taken away in chains and there would simply be another Emperor that Demerzel would serve……and dominate.</p><p>可是克里昂不行，他需要丹莫刺尔。事实上，既然他想到了行刺的可能性……鉴诸帝国的近代史，他必然会想到这个可能性……他看得出除掉丹莫刺尔是相当不可能的事，根本就做不到。不论他，克里昂，试图以多么高明的手法布署，丹莫刺尔（他确定）总有办法预见这个行动，会知道它正在默默进行，会以高明许多倍的手腕安排一场宫廷政变。在丹莫刺尔有可能被五花大绑押走之前，克里昂自己就会丧命。然后很快又会出现另一个皇帝，而丹莫刺尔将继续侍奉他……并且驾驭他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Or would Demerzel tire of the game and make himself Emperor? </p><p>或者丹莫刺尔会厌倦了这种游戏，自己做起皇帝来？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Never! The habit of anonymity was too strong in him. If Demerzel exposed himself to the world, then his powers, his wisdom, his luck (whatever it was) would surely desert him. Cleon was convinced of that. He felt it to be beyond dispute.</p><p>绝对不会！他那隐藏幕后的习性太过根深蒂固。假若丹莫刺尔让自己在世上曝光，那么他的权力、他的智慧、他的运气（不论那是什么）必将弃他而去。克里昂深深相信这一点，觉得毫无争论的余地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So while he behaved himself, Cleon was safe. With no ambitions of his own, Demerzel would serve him faithfully.</p><p>所以只要安分守己，克里昂就安全无虞。由于丹莫刺尔本人并无野心，他会忠心地侍奉自己的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And now here was Demerzel, dressed so severely and simply that it made Cleon uneasily conscious of the useless ornamentation of his robes of state, now thankfully removed with the aid of two valets. Naturally, it would not be until he was alone and in dishabille that Demerzel would glide into view. </p><p>现在丹莫刺尔就在这里，他的穿着如此简单朴素，使克里昂对自己礼袍上那些无用的装饰感到十分不自在，还好刚才在两个侍仆的帮助下，他把礼袍及时脱了下来。自然，总要等到他一人独处，并且换上便装，丹莫刺尔才会翩然出场。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Demerzel, said the Emperor of all the Galaxy, "I am tired!"</p><p>“丹莫刺尔，”统治全银河的皇帝说，“我累了！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"State functions are tiring, Sire," murmured Demerzel.</p><p>“启禀陛下，国宴确是一件累人的事。”丹莫刺尔喃喃道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then must I have them every evening?"</p><p>“必须每天晚上都来一场吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not every evening, but they are essential. It gratifies others to see you and to be taken note of by you. It helps keep the Empire running smoothly."</p><p>“并非每天晚上，但是每场国宴都很重要。无论见到您或是让您注意到的人，都会感到心满意足。这能帮助帝国的运作保持一帆风顺。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Empire used to be kept running smoothly by power," said the Emperor somberly. "Now it must be kept running by a smile, a wave of the hand, a murmured word, and a medal or a plaque."</p><p>“过去，帝国是靠权力来保持一帆风顺。”大帝以阴郁的口吻说，“如今，却必须靠一个微笑、一个挥手的动作、一句低声的言语，以及一枚勋章或奖章来保持运作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If all that keeps the peace, Sire, there is much to be said for it. And your reign proceeds well."</p><p>“只要有助于天下太平，陛下，就非常值得这么做。而您的统治一向相当成功。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You know why……because I have you at my side. My only real gift is that I am aware of your importance." He looked at Demerzel slyly. "My son need not be my heir. He is not a talented boy. What if I make you my heir?"</p><p>“你知道为什么吗……因为我有你随侍在侧。我唯一真正的天赋，就是了解你的重要性。”他用狡狯的目光望着丹莫刺尔，“我儿子并不一定要做我的继位者，他不是个才能出众的孩子。我让你当我的继位者如何？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Demerzel said freezingly, "Sire, that is unthinkable. I would not usurp the throne. I would not steal it from your rightful heir. Besides, if I have displeased you, punish me justly. Surely, nothing I have done or could possibly do deserves the punishment of being made Emperor."</p><p>丹莫刺尔以冷冰冰的口吻说：“启禀陛下，这是不可思议的事。我绝不会篡夺皇位，绝不会从合法继位者手中将它偷走。此外，若是我得罪了您，请以公平的方式惩处我。无论如何，我所做过的一切，或是可能做的任何一件事，都没有严重到需要以皇位作为惩罚。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Cleon laughed. "For that true assessment of the value of the Imperial throne, Demerzel, I abandon any thought of punishing you. Come now, let us talk about something. I would sleep, but I am not yet ready for the ceremonies with which they put me to bed. Let us talk."</p><p>克里昂哈哈大笑。“冲着你对皇位所做的真实评价，丹莫刺尔，我打消一切想要处罚你的念头。好啦，我们来谈一谈。我即将就寝，但我暂时还不准备接受侍候我上床的那些繁文缛节。我们聊聊吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"About what, Sire?"</p><p>“聊些什么，陛下？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"About anything……About that mathematician and his psychohistory. I think about him every once in a while, you know. I thought of him at dinner tonight. I wondered: What if a psychohistorical analysis would predict a method for making it possible to be an Emperor without endless ceremony?"</p><p>“任何事都能聊……就聊聊那个数学家和他的心理史学吧。你知道吗，我三天两头会想到他。刚刚在晚宴上我又想到他，我暗自嘀咕，心理史学分析若能提出一套办法，让我这个皇帝得以避免无止无休的繁文缛节，那会是什么样的局面？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I somehow think, Sire, that even the cleverest psychohistorian could not manage that."</p><p>“我倒是认为，陛下，即使最高明的心理史学家也无法做到这点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, tell me the latest. Is he still hiding among those peculiar baldheads of Mycogen? You promised you would winkle him out of there."</p><p>“好吧，告诉我最新状况。他仍旧躲在麦曲生那些古怪的光头之间吗？你答应过我，会把他从那里揪出来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So I did, Sire, and I moved in that direction, but I regret that I must say that I failed."</p><p>“我的确答应过陛下，也曾经朝这方面进行。但是很遗憾，我必须承认我失败了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Failed?" The Emperor allowed himself to frown. "I don't like that."</p><p>“失败了？”大帝毫不掩饰地皱起眉头，“我不喜欢这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nor I, Sire. I planned to have the mathematician be encouraged to commit some blasphemous act……such acts are easy to commit in Mycogen, especially for an outsider……one that would call for severe punishment. The mathematician would then be forced to appeal to the Emperor and, as a result, we would get him. I planned it at the cost of insignificant concessions on our part……important to Mycogen, totally unimportant to us……and I meant to play no direct role in the arrangement. It was to be handled subtly."</p><p>“启禀陛下，我也不喜欢。我计划引诱那个数学家做出某种亵渎行为，会遭致严重惩罚的那种……在麦曲生很容易触犯亵渎罪，尤其对外人而言。然后，那个数学家会被迫向大帝上诉，这样一来，我们就能得到他。根据我的计划，我们付出的代价只是微不足道的让步……对麦曲生很重要，对我们则完全无关痛痒。在我的布署中，我并未打算直接参与，只想巧妙地操纵这次行动。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I dare say," said Cleon, "but it failed. Did the Mayor of Mycogen……:</p><p>“我也这么想，”克里昂道，“但是它失败了。难道是麦曲生的区长……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He is called the High Elder, Sire."</p><p>“启禀陛下，他的头衔是元老。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do not quibble over titles. Did this High Elder refuse?"</p><p>“别和我争辩头衔。这个元老拒绝合作吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On the contrary, Sire, he agreed and the mathematician, Seldon, fell into the trap neatly."</p><p>“恰恰相反，陛下，他一口答应。而那个数学家，谢顿，一下子就掉进了陷阱。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then?"</p><p>“那后来呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He was allowed to leave unharmed."</p><p>“他获准离开，毫发无损。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why?" said Cleon indignantly.</p><p>“为什么？”克里昂气冲冲地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of this I am not certain, Sire, but I suspect we were outbid."</p><p>“启禀陛下，这件事我还不确定，但我怀疑有人出更高的价。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"By whom? By the Mayor of Wye?"</p><p>“什么人？卫荷区长吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Possibly, Sire, but I doubt that. I have Wye under constant surveillance. If they had gained the mathematician, I would know it by now."</p><p>“启禀陛下，有此可能，可是我对这点存疑。卫荷在我的持续监视之下，假如他们得到那个数学家，我现在就应该知道了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor was not merely frowning. He was clearly enraged. "Demerzel, this is bad. I am greatly displeased. A failure like this makes me wonder if you are perhaps not the man you once were. What measures shall we take against Mycogen for this clear defiance of the Emperors wiShe's?"</p><p>此时大帝不只是皱眉，他显然已经火冒三丈。“丹莫刺尔，这太糟了，我极为不高兴。这样子的失败，不禁令我怀疑你是否变成了另一个人。麦曲生这种显然违抗皇帝意旨的行为，我们应该采取什么手段教训一番？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Demerzel bowed low in recognition of the storm unleashed, but he said in steely tones, "It would be a mistake to move against Mycogen now, Sire. The disruption that would follow would play into the hands of Wye."</p><p>丹莫刺尔察觉到一股奔腾的怒火，赶紧深深弯下腰来，但仍以钢铁般坚定的语气说：“启禀陛下，现在对麦曲生采取行动会是个错误。那必将造成四分五裂，正中卫荷下怀。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But we must do something."</p><p>“但我们必须做点什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps not, Sire. It is not as bad as it may seem."</p><p>“启禀陛下，或许什么都不该做，事态不如表面上那么糟。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can it be not as bad as it seems?"</p><p>“怎么会不如表面上那么糟？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Youll remember, Sire, that this mathematician was convinced that psychohistory was impractical."</p><p>“您应该记得，陛下，这个数学家深信心理史学是不切实际的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course I remember that, but that doesnt matter, does it? For our purposes?"</p><p>“我当然记得这点，可是这并不重要，对不对？我是指对我们的目的而言。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps not. But if it were to become practical, it would serve our purposes to an infinitely great extent, Sire. And from what I have been able to find out, the mathematician is now attempting to make psychohistory practical. His blasphemous attempt in Mycogen was, I understand, part of an attempt at solving the problem of psychohistory. In that case, it may pay us, Sire, to leave him to himself. It will serve us better to pick him up when he is closer to his goal or has reached it."</p><p>“或许吧。但启禀陛下，假使它能变得可行，对我们的帮助将会增加无数倍。而根据我所能查到的线索，那个数学家正试图使心理史学成为可行。他在麦曲生做出的亵渎行为，据我了解，也是他试图解出心理史学问题的一种努力。在这种情况下，陛下，值得我们暂且不去碰他。等到他接近或达到目标的时候再把他抓起来，对我们会更有用的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not if Wye gets him first."</p><p>“除非卫荷先得到他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That, I shall see to it, will not happen."</p><p>“我会盯牢，确保不会发生这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In the same way that you succeeded in winkling the mathematician out of Mycogen just now?"</p><p>“就像你成功地把那个数学家揪出麦曲生一样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I will not make a mistake the next time, Sire," said Demerzel coldly.</p><p>“启禀陛下，下次我不会再犯错了。”丹莫刺尔冷静地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Emperor said, "Demerzel, you had better not. I will not tolerate another mistake in this respect." And then he added pettishly, "I think I shall not sleep tonight after all."</p><p>大帝说道：“丹莫刺尔，你最好不会。在这件事情上，我绝不再容忍另一个错误。”然后，他又没好气地补充一句：“我想今晚我根本别想睡了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Jirad Tisalver of the Dahl Sector was short. The top of his head came up only to Hari Seldons nose. He did not seem to take that to heart, however. He had handsome, even features, was given to smiling, and sported a thick black mustache and crisply curling black hair.</p><p>达尔区的吉拉德·堤沙佛是个矮个子，他的头顶只到哈里·谢顿的鼻尖。然而，他似乎没有把这件事放在心上。他有一副英俊而端正的五官，总喜欢带着笑容，而且留着两撇又浓又黑的八字胡，以及一头波浪状的鬈曲黑发。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He lived, with his wife and a half-grown daughter, in an apartment of seven small rooms, kept meticulously clean, but almost bare of furnishings. </p><p>他与他的妻子，以及一个尚未成年的女儿，住在一栋共有七个小房间的公寓里。他们小心翼翼地保持得很干净，但里面几乎没有什么家具。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tisalver said, "I apologize, Master Seldon and Mistress Venabili, that I cannot give you the luxury to which you must be accustomed, but Dahl is a poor sector and I am not even among the better-off among our people."</p><p>堤沙佛说：“我万分抱歉，谢顿老爷，凡纳比里夫人，你们一定习惯了豪华的生活，我却不能为你们提供那些享受。不过达尔是个穷区，而我在自己同胞中也不能算混得好的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The more reason," responded Seldon, "that we must apologize to you for placing the burden of our presence upon you."</p><p>“正因为如此，”谢顿答道，“我们更是必须向你致歉，我们的出现想必给你带来很大负担。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No burden, Master Seldon. Master Hummin has arranged to pay us generously for your use of our humble quarters and the credits would be welcome even if you were not……and you are."</p><p>“谢顿老爷，完全没有负担。为了你们使用这间简陋的房舍，夫铭老爷已经说好要付我们一大笔租金。即使我不欢迎你们，也会欢迎那些信用点……我只是说笑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon remembered Hummins parting words when they finally arrived in Dahl</p><p>谢顿还记得他们终于来到达尔后，夫铭在临别前说的一番话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>. "Seldon" he had said, "this is the third place Ive arranged as sanctuary. The first two were notoriously beyond the reach of the Imperium, which might well have served to attract their attention; after all, they were logical places for you. This one is different. It is poor, unremarkable, and, as a matter of fact, unsafe in some ways. It is not a natural refuge for you, so that the Emperor and his Chief of Staff may not think to turn their eyes in this direction. Would you mind staying out of trouble this time, then?"</p><p>“谢顿，”他说，“这是我帮你找的第三个避难所。前面两个地方，都是出了名的皇帝势力不及之处，因此很有可能吸引他们的注意。毕竟对你这个人而言，它们是合理的藏身之地。此地则不同，它相当贫穷，毫不起眼，而且事实上，可说并非十分安全。它不是你寻求庇护的理想选择，因此大帝和他的行政首长也许不会将目光转到这个方向。所以说，这次你可否别再惹麻烦？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I will try, Hummin," said Seldon, a little offended. "Please be aware that the trouble is not of my seeking. I am trying to learn what may well take me thirty lifetimes to learn if I am to have the slightest chance of organizing psychohistory."</p><p>“夫铭，我会努力的。”谢顿有点不高兴，“请你明白一件事，我想找的并不是麻烦。即使我真有创立心理史学的一点点机会，我所试图探寻的，也很可能是需要三十辈子才能寻获的知识。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I understand," said Hummin. "Your efforts at learning brought you to Upperside in Streeling and to the Elders aerie in Mycogen and to who can guess where in Dahl. As for you, Dr. Venabili, I know youve been trying to take care of Seldon, but you must try harder. Get it fixed in your head that he is the most important person on Trantor……or in the Galaxy, for that matter……and that he must be kept secure at any cost."</p><p>“我能了解。”夫铭说，“你为了寻找答案所做的努力，把你带到了斯璀璘的上方，以及麦曲生的长老阁，谁猜得到你在达尔还会去哪里。至于你，凡纳比里博士，我知道你一直试着照顾谢顿，但你必须更加努力。你要把一件事牢牢记在脑子里，他是川陀上最重要的人，甚至可说是全银河最重要的人物，必须不计任何代价保护他的安全。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I will continue to do my best," said Dors stiffly. </p><p>“我会继续尽力而为。”铎丝硬生生地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And as for your host family, they have their peculiarities, but they are essentially good people with whom I have dealt before. Try not to get them in trouble either.</p><p>“至于你们的主人，他们有他们奇怪的地方，但他们本质上都是好人，我以前和他们打过交道。也要尽量别给他们惹上麻烦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Tisalver, at least, did not seem to anticipate trouble of any kind from his new tenants and his expressed pleasure at the company he now had……quite apart from the rent credits he would be getting……seemed quite sincere. </p><p>不过，至少堤沙佛似乎并未预期新房客会带来任何麻烦。而他对他们的到来所表现的喜悦……几乎与他将赚到的租金无关……也似乎相当真诚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had never been outside Dahl and his appetite for tales of distant places was enormous. His wife too, bowing and smiling, would listen and their daughter, with a finger in her mouth, would allow one eye to peep from behind the door. </p><p>他从未踏出达尔一步，因此对远方的传闻有极大的胃口；而总是鞠躬哈腰、笑容满面的堤沙佛夫人也喜欢听。至于他们的女儿，则总是吮着一根手指，从门后露出一只眼睛偷窥。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was usually after dinner, when the entire family assembled, that Seldon and Dors were expected to talk of the outside world. The food was plentiful enough, but it was bland and often tough. So soon after the tangy food of Mycogen, it was all but inedible. The "table" was a long shelf against one wall and they ate standing up. </p><p>通常是在晚餐后，全家人聚在一起的时候，他们就会请求谢顿与铎丝讲述外面的世界。食物一向足够丰盛，不过却淡而无味，而且通常相当粗糙。由于不久前才享受过香味扑鼻的麦曲生食品，两人都感到几乎难以下咽。而“餐桌”只是紧靠墙壁的一个长架子，大家全都站着进餐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gentle questioning by Seldon elicited the fact that this was the usual situation among Dahlites as a whole and was not due to unusual poverty. Of course, Mistress Tisalver explained, there were those with high government jobs in Dahl who were prone to adopt all kinds of effete customs like chairs……she called them "body shelves"……but this was looked down upon by the solid middle class. </p><p>谢顿以委婉的方式问出了真相，原来在达尔人之间，这是相当寻常的状况，并非由于特别贫穷的缘故。当然，堤沙佛夫人解释道，达尔也有些身居政府高位的人士，他们倾向于接受各种文弱的习俗，比如说椅子……她称之为“身体架子”……但纯粹的中产阶级都瞧不起那些东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Much as they disapproved of unnecessary luxury, though, the Tisalvers loved hearing about it, listening with a virtual storm of tongue-clicking when told of mattresses lifted on legs, of ornate chests and wardrobes, and of a superfluity of tableware.</p><p>虽然他们对没必要的奢侈不敢苟同，堤沙佛一家却很爱听这类的叙述。当他们听到由脚架撑起的床垫、华丽的橱柜与衣橱，以及摆满餐桌的餐具时，总是一个劲地啧啧称奇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They listened also to a description of Mycogenian customs, while Jirad Tisalver stroked his own hair complacently and made it quite obvious that he would as soon think of emasculation as of depilation. Mistress Tisalver was furious at any mention of female subservience and flatly refused to believe that the Sisters accepted it tranquilly.</p><p>他们也听到了有关麦曲生习俗的描述。当时，吉拉德·堤沙佛得意地摸摸自己的头发，意思显然是宁可去势也不愿接受脱毛手术。而每当提到女性百依百顺时，堤沙佛夫人一律表现出无比的愤慨，根本拒绝相信“姐妹们”会默默接受这些待遇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They seized most, however, on Seldons. casual reference to the Imperial grounds. When, upon questioning, it turned out that Seldon had actually seen and spoken to the Emperor, a blanket of awe enveloped the family. It took a while before they dared ask questions and Seldon found that he could not satisfy them. He had not, after all, seen much of the grounds and even less of the Palace interior.</p><p>然而，他们最不放过的一点，则是谢顿随口提到的御苑。而在进一步追问下，他们发现谢顿不但亲眼见过皇帝，还跟皇帝说过话，一股敬畏的气氛立刻笼罩这一家人。过了好一会儿，他们才敢继续发问，谢顿却发觉自己无法满足他们。毕竟，他并未对御苑多做浏览，皇宫内部就更别提了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That disappointed the Tisalvers and they were unremitting in their attempts to elicit more. And, having heard of Seldons Imperial adventure, they found it hard to believe Dorss assertion that, for her part, she had never been anywhere in the Imperial grounds. Most of all, they rejected Seldons casual comment that the Emperor had talked and behaved very much as any ordinary human being would. That seemed utterly impossible to the Tisalvers. </p><p>这使得堤沙佛一家人相当失望，于是他们毫不放松，试图问出更多事情。在谢顿讲完他的皇宫历险之后，铎丝却声明自己从未踏进御苑一步，令他们实在难以置信。此外，谢顿曾经顺口说到，皇帝的言行举止与普通人非常接近，这点他们尤其拒绝接受。对堤沙佛一家而言，那似乎是绝不可能的事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After three evenings of this, Seldon found himself tiring. He had, at first, welcomed the chance to do nothing for a while (during the day, at least) but view some of the history book-films that Dors recommended. The Tisalvers turned over their book-viewer to their guests during the day with good grace, though the little girl seemed unhappy and was sent over to a neighbors apartment to use theirs for her homework.</p><p>经过三个这样的晚上，谢顿开始生厌了。起初，他很高兴能够暂时什么也不做（至少白天如此），只是看看铎丝推荐的几本历史影视书。堤沙佛一家人表现得很大方，白天都会将他们的阅读镜让给客人。只是小女孩似乎不太高兴，因为她被父母送到邻居家，借用对方的阅读镜来做功课。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It doesnt help," Seldon said restlessly in the security of his room after he had piped in some music to discourage eavesdropping. "I can see your fascination with history, but its all endless detail. Its a mountainous heap……no, a Galactic heap……of data in which I cant see the basic organization."</p><p>“这没有任何帮助。”谢顿烦躁不安地说，此时他已躲进自己房间，并弄出了一些音乐以干扰窃听。“我看得出你对历史如何着迷，但历史全是无止无休的细节，是堆积如山……不，堆积如银河的资料……我根本看不出任何基本的条理。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I dare say," said Dors, "that there must have been a time when human beings saw no organization in the stars in the sky, but eventually they discovered the Galactic structure."</p><p>“我敢说，”铎丝道，“过去一定曾有一段时期，人类看不出天上的星星有什么条理，但他们终究发现了银河系的结构。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And Im sure that took generations, not weeks. There must have been a time when physics seemed a mass of unrelated observations before the central natural laws were discovered and that took generations……And what of the Tisalvers?"</p><p>“我确信这得花上好些世代，而绝非几周的时间。过去一定也曾有一段时期，在最核心的自然定律发现之前，物理学似乎只是一堆毫无关联的观测结果，而那些发现也需要许多世代……堤沙佛这家人是怎么回事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What of them? I think theyre being very nice."</p><p>“他们又怎么了，我认为他们一直很不错。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Theyre curious."</p><p>“他们太好奇了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course they are. Wouldnt you be if you were in their place?"</p><p>“他们当然会。假如你是他们，难道你不会吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But is it just curiosity? They seem to be ferociously interested in my meeting with the Emperor."</p><p>“但那仅仅是好奇吗？他们对于我见过大帝这档事，好像有兴趣得不得了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors seemed impatient. "Again……its only natural. Wouldnt you be……if the situation was reversed?"</p><p>铎丝似乎不耐烦了。“同理……那只是自然反应。倘若易地而处，难道你不会吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It makes me nervous."</p><p>“这令我神经过敏。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hummin brought us here."</p><p>“是夫铭把我们带到这儿来的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but hes not perfect. He brought me to the University and I was maneuvered Upperside. He brought us to Sunmaster Fourteen, who entrapped us. You know he did. Twice bitten, at least once shy. Im tired of being questioned."</p><p>“没错，但他并非十全十美。他把我带去斯璀璘大学，结果我被诱骗到上方去；他送我们去找日主十四，结果那人却陷害我们，你该知道他早有预谋。上两次当，至少该学一次乖。我受够了被问东问西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then turn the tables, Hari. aren't you interested in Dahl?"</p><p>“哈里，那就反客为主。难道你对达尔没有兴趣吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course. What do you know about it to begin with?"</p><p>“当然有。你原先对它了解多少？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing. Its just one of more than eight hundred sectors and Ive only been on Trantor a little over two years."</p><p>“一无所知。它只不过是八百多个区其中之一，而我来川陀才两年多一点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Exactly. And there are twenty-five million other worlds and Ive been on this problem only a little over two months……I tell you. I want to go back to Helicon and take up a study of the mathematics of turbulence, which was my Ph.D. problem, and forget I ever saw……or thought I saw……that turbulence gave an insight into human society."</p><p>“正是如此。银河系共有两千五百万个世界，而我研究这个问题才两个月多一点。我告诉你，我很想回赫利肯去，重新着手研究湍流的数学，那是我的博士论文题目。我要忘掉我曾经看出……或说自以为看出……湍流问题能对人类社会提供一种洞视。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But that evening he said to Tisalver, "But you know, Master Tisalver, youve never told me what you do, the nature of your work."</p><p>不过当天傍晚，他还是问堤沙佛说：“你知道吗，堤沙佛老爷，你从未告诉我你做些什么……你从事的行业。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Me?" Tisalver placed his fingers on his chest, which was covered by the simple white T-shirt with nothing underneath, which seemed to be the standard male uniform in Dahl. "Nothing much. I work at the local holovision station in programming. Its very dull, but its a living."</p><p>“我？”堤沙佛伸出五指按在自己胸口。他穿着一件单薄的白色短衫，里面什么也没有，那似乎是达尔男性的标准制服。“没做什么，我在本地全息电视台做节目策划。非常无聊的差事，但它总能养家糊口。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And its respectable," said Mistress Tisalver. "It means he doesnt have to work in the heatsinks."</p><p>“而且是个体面的职业，”堤沙佛夫人说，“这就代表他不必在热闾工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The heatsinks?" said Dors, lifting her light eyebrows and managing to look fascinated.</p><p>“热闾？”铎丝扬起淡淡的眉毛，硬是显得很有兴趣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh well," said Tisalver, "thats what Dahl is best known for. It isn't  much, but forty billion people on Trantor need energy and we supply a lot of it. We don't get appreciated, but Id like to see some of the fancy sectors do without it."</p><p>“喔，”堤沙佛说，“那是达尔最出名的东西。说穿了没什么，但川陀四百亿人口都需要能源，而我们提供其中很大一部分。没有人感谢我们，可是我真想看看，那些高级区失去能源后是什么情景。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked confused. "Doesnt Trantor get its energy from solar power stations in orbit?"</p><p>谢顿显得相当困惑。“川陀的能源不是来自轨道上的太阳能发电站吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Some," said Tisalver, "and some from nuclear fusion stations out on the islands and some from microfusion motors and some from wind stations Upperside, but half"……he raised a finger in emphasis and his face looked unusually grave……"half comes from the heatsinks. There are heatsinks in lots of places, but none……none……as rich as those in Dahl. Are you serious that you don't know about the heatsinks? You sit there and stare at me."</p><p>“一部分而已。”堤沙佛说，“此外，一部分来自一些岛上的核融合发电站，一部分来自微融合发电机，一部分来自上方的风力发电站。可是有一半，”他举起一根手指加强语气，表情显得严肃异常。“有一半是来自热闾。许多地方都有热闾，但没有一处……没有一处……像达尔的蕴藏这般丰富。你当真不知道热闾是什么吗？你坐在那里瞪着我猛瞧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said quickly, "We are Outworlders, you know." (She had almost said tribespeople, but had caught herself in time.) "Especially Dr. Seldon. Hes only been on Trantor a couple of months."</p><p>铎丝很快接口：“你知道，我们是外星人士。”她差点就要说“外族人”，但及时改了口，“尤其是谢顿博士，他在川陀只待了几个月。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Really?" said Mistress Tisalver. She was a trifle shorter than her husband, was plump without quite being fat, had her dark hair drawn tightly back into a bun, and possessed rather beautiful dark eyes. Like her husband, she appeared to be in her thirties.</p><p>“真的吗？”堤沙佛夫人说。她比丈夫稍微矮一点，丰满但不算肥胖，拥有一对相当美丽的黑眼睛。她的黑发梳在脑后，紧紧扎成一个发髻。像她的丈夫一样，她看来也是三十几岁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(After a period in Mycogen, not actually long in duration but intense, it struck Dors as odd to have a woman enter the conversation at will. How quickly modes and manners establish themselves, she thought, and made a mental note to mention that to Seldon……one more item for his psychohistory.) </p><p>在麦曲生住过一阵子之后，虽然并非真的待了很久，但由于密集式的耳濡目染，如今对铎丝而言，女性随意加入男性的交谈是很奇怪的一件事。风俗与习惯多么容易不知不觉建立起来，她一面想，一面暗自提醒自己，要找机会对谢顿提一提，为他的心理史学再加上一条定律。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Oh yes, she said. "Dr. Seldon is from Helicon."</p><p>“喔，是真的。”她说，“谢顿博士来自赫利肯。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mistress Tisalver registered polite ignorance. "And where might that be?"</p><p>堤沙佛夫人礼貌地表现得孤陋寡闻。“那是在哪里呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "Why, its……" She turned to Seldon. "Where is it, Hari?" </p><p>铎丝说：“啊，它在……”她转向谢顿，“哈里，它究竟在哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked abashed. "To tell you the truth, I don't think I could locate it very easily on a Galactic model without looking up the coordinates. All I can say is that its on the other side of the central black hole from Trantor and getting there by hypership is rather a chore."</p><p>谢顿显得难为情。“老实告诉你们，如果不查坐标，我想我也不容易在银河模型中找到它的位置。我只能说从川陀看出去，它位于中心黑洞的另一侧，搭超空间飞船到那里还挺麻烦的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mistress Tisalver said, "I don't think Jirad and I will ever be on a hypership."</p><p>堤沙佛夫人说：“我想吉拉德和我永远没机会登上超空间飞船。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Someday, Casilia," said Tisalver cheerfully, "maybe we will. But tell us about Helicon, Master Seldon."</p><p>“总有一天，凯西莉娅，”堤沙佛以快活的口气说，“我们会有机会的。但请跟我们说说赫利肯，谢顿老爷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "To me that would be dull. Its just a world, like any other. Only Trantor is different from all the rest. There are no heatsinks on Helicon……or probably anywhere else……except Trantor. Tell me about them."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“对我来说那是一件无聊的事。它只不过是个普通的世界，就像任何世界一样，只有川陀才和其他所有的世界大不相同。赫利肯上没有热闾，也许其他地方都没有，唯有川陀例外。跟我说说热闾吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>("Only Trantor is different from all the rest." The sentence repeated itself in Seldons mind and for a moment he grasped at it, and for some reason Dorss hand-on-thigh story suddenly recurred to him, but Tisalver was speaking and it passed out of Seldons mind as quickly as it had entered.)</p><p>“只有川陀才和其他所有的世界大不相同。”这句话在谢顿心中一再重复，而且有刹那的时间，它几乎已在他的掌握中。不知道为什么，铎丝那个毛手毛脚的故事突然再度浮现。但由于堤沙佛开始说话了，那点灵光来得急也去得快，随即溜出谢顿的心灵。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tisalver said, "If you really want to know about heatsinks, I can show you." He turned to his wife. "Casilia, would you mind if tomorrow evening I take Master Seldon to the heatsinks."</p><p>堤沙佛说：“如果你真想了解热闾，我可以带你去参观。”他转头面向妻子，“凯西莉娅，如果明天傍晚我带谢顿老爷前往热闾，你会不会介意？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And me," said Dors quickly.</p><p>“还有我。”铎丝赶紧说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And Mistress Venabili?"</p><p>“还有凡纳比里夫人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mistress Tisalver frowned and said sharply, "I don't think it would be a good idea. Our visitors would find it dull."</p><p>堤沙佛夫人皱起眉头，以尖锐的声音说：“我认为这不是什么好主意，我们的客人会觉得很无聊。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't think so, Mistress Tisalver," said Seldon ingratiatingly. "We would very much like to see the heatsinks. We would be delighted if you would join us too……and your little daughter……if she wants to come."</p><p>“堤沙佛夫人，我想不至于。”谢顿以逢迎的口吻说，“我们非常希望去看看热闾。如果你也加入，我们会十分高兴……还有你的小女儿，如果她也想去的话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To the heatsinks?" said Mistress Tisalver, stiffening. "Its no place at all for a decent woman."</p><p>“到热闾去？”堤沙佛夫人的态度转趋强硬，“那绝不是一位端庄妇人能去的地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt embarrassed at his gaffe. "I meant no harm, Mistress Tisalver."</p><p>谢顿对自己的鲁莽感到很尴尬。“堤沙佛夫人，我并没有恶意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No offense," said Tisalver. "Casilia thinks its beneath us and so it is, but as long as I don't work there, its no distress merely to visit and show it to guests. But it is uncomfortable and I would never get Casilia to dress properly."</p><p>“没关系，”堤沙佛说，“凯西莉娅认为它是低贱之地，事实也的确如此。但只要我不在那里工作，光是带客人参观一下倒无妨。不过那里很不舒服，而我绝不会让凯西莉娅换上去那儿的服装。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They got up from their crouching positions. Dahlite "chairs" were merely molded plastic seats on small wheels and they cramped Seldons knees terribly and seemed to wiggle at his least body movement. The Tisalvers, however, had mastered the art of sitting firmly and rose without trouble and without needing to use their arms for help as Seldon had to. Dors also got up without trouble and Seldon once again marveled at her natural grace.</p><p>聊完之后，他们便从蹲伏的位置站起来。达尔的“椅子”只是个塑胶坐垫，下面装了几个小轮子。谢顿的膝盖被它整得几乎无法动弹，而且只要他的身子稍有动作，这种椅子似乎就会开始摆动。然而，堤沙佛一家人却练就稳坐其上的本事，起身时也毫无困难，不需要像谢顿那样得借助手臂。铎丝也轻而易举就站了起来，谢顿再次赞叹她所表现的自然优雅。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Before they parted to their separate rooms for the night, Seldon said to Dors, "Are you sure you know nothing about heatsinks? Mistress Tisalver makes them seem unpleasant."</p><p>在他们回到各自的房间就寝之前，谢顿对铎丝说：“你确定自己对热闾一无所知吗？听堤沙佛夫人的口气，热闾似乎惹人反感。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They cant be that unpleasant or Tisalver wouldnt suggest taking us on tour. Lets be content to be surprised."</p><p>“不可能多么反感，否则堤沙佛不会提议要带我们参观。我们等着开眼界吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tisalver said, "Youll need proper clothing." Mistress Tisalver sniffed markedly in the background.</p><p>堤沙佛说：“你们需要适当的服装。”堤沙佛夫人则在背后大声嗤之以鼻。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Cautiously, Seldon, thinking of kirtles with vague distress, said, "What do you mean by proper clothing?"</p><p>警觉的谢顿立刻联想到裰服，心中兴起一阵模糊的懊恼。他说：“你说适当的服装是什么意思？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Something light, such as I wear. A T-shirt, very short sleeves, loose slacks, loose underpants, foot socks, open sandals. I have it all for you."</p><p>“轻便的衣服，像我穿的这种。袖子很短的短衫、宽松的长裤、宽松的内裤、短袜、开口的凉鞋。我都为你们准备好了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Good. It doesnt sound bad."</p><p>“很好，听来不赖。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As for Mistress Venabili, I have the same. I hope it fits."</p><p>“至于凡纳比里夫人，我同样准备了一套，希望能合身。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The clothes Tisalver supplied each of them (which were his own) fit fine……if a bit snugly. When they were ready, they bade Mistress Tisalver good-bye and she, with a resigned if still disapproving air, watched them from the doorway as they set off.</p><p>堤沙佛提供给他们两人的服装（都是他自己的）十分合身，甚至可说过分舒适。他们准备好之后，便向堤沙佛夫人告辞，她则带着仍旧不以为然却已放弃努力的神情，站在门口目送他们三人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was early evening and there was an attractive twilight glow above. It was clear that Dahls lights would soon be winking on. The temperature was mild and there were virtually no vehicles to be seen; everyone was walking. In the distance was the ever-present hum of an Expressway and the occasional glitter of its lights could be easily seen.</p><p>此时是傍晚时分，上空有一团迷人的昏黄暮光。显然，达尔的灯火很快便会纷纷眨眼。温度适中，街上几乎见不到任何车辆；人人都在步行。远处传来捷运无歇无止的嗡嗡声，不时闪烁的车灯也不难看见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Dahlites, Seldon noted, did not seem to be walking toward any particular destination. Rather, there seemed to be a promenade going on, a walking for pleasure. Perhaps, if Dahl was an impoverished sector, as Tisalver had implied, inexpensive entertainment was at a premium and what was as pleasant……and as inexpensive……as an evening stroll?</p><p>谢顿注意到，这些达尔人似乎并非走向什么特定的目的地。反之，他们像是参加一次漫步游行，纯粹为了乐趣而走。假如达尔果真是个穷区，正如堤沙佛暗示的那样，低廉的娱乐或许就是很重要的一件事。还有什么比黄昏漫步更有乐趣，而且更廉价的呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt himself easing automatically into the gait of an aimless stroll himself and felt the warmth of friendliness all around him. People greeted each other as they passed and exchanged a few words. Black mustaches of different shape and thickness flashed everywhere and seemed a requisite for the Dahlite male, as ubiquitous as the bald heads of the Mycogenian Brothers. </p><p>谢顿觉得自己自然而然融入了这种毫无目标的闲适步调中，并且感到四周充满亲切与温暖。人们擦身而过时，总会互相打个招呼，并简单交谈几句。不同式样、不同粗细的黑色八字胡处处可见，仿佛是达尔男性的一项必备要件，一如麦曲生兄弟的光头一样无处不在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was an evening rite, a way of making sure that another day had passed safely and that ones friends were still well and happy. And, it soon became apparent, Dors caught every eye. In the twilight glow, the ruddiness of her hair had deepened, but it stood out against the sea of black-haired heads (except for the occasional gray) like a gold coin winking its way across a pile of coal.</p><p>这是一种傍晚的仪式，用以确定又安稳过了一天，朋友们依旧身体健康、精神愉快。有一件事很快变得显而易见，那就是铎丝吸引了所有的目光。昏黄的暮色中，她略红的金发变得更加鲜红，在一片黑发海洋的衬托下（偶尔出现的灰发是唯一的例外），好像一枚金币闪闪发光地掠过一堆煤炭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This is very pleasant," said Seldon.</p><p>“实在非常愉快。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is," said Tisalver. "Ordinarily, Id be walking with my wife and shed be in her element. There is no one for a kilometer around whom she doesnt know by name, occupation, and interrelationships. I cant do that. Right now, half the people who greet me……I couldnt tell you their names. But, in any case, we mustnt creep along too slowly. We must get to the elevator. Its a busy world on the lower levels."</p><p>“没错，”堤沙佛说，“通常，我都和我的妻子一起散步，她总是如鱼得水。在方圆一公里范围内，任何人的名字、职业，以及彼此的关系她都晓得。这点我做不到，现在这个时候，和我打招呼的人有一半……我无法告诉你他们的名字。但无论如何，我们绝不能走得太慢。我们必须赶到升降机那里，底层是个忙碌的世界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were on the elevator going down when Dors said, "I presume, Master Tisalver, that the heatsinks are places where the internal heat of Trantor is being used to produce steam that will turn turbines and produce electricity."</p><p>当他们进了升降机后，铎丝说道：“堤沙佛老爷，我想所谓的热闾，是利用川陀的地热来产生蒸汽，以转动涡轮机来发电的地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, no. Highly efficient large-scale thermopiles produce electricity directly. don't ask me the details, please. Im just a holovision programmer. In fact, don't ask anyone the details down there. The whole thing is one big black box. It works, but no one knows how."</p><p>“喔，并非如此，是利用高效率的大型‘热电堆’直接产生电力。别问我细节，拜托，我只是个全息电视节目策划人。事实上，到了下面也别向任何人询问细节。整个东西是个很大的黑盒子，它运作正常，却没有人知道是如何做到的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What if something goes wrong?"</p><p>“万一出了什么问题呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It doesnt usually, but if it does, some expert comes over from somewhere. Someone who understands computers. The whole thing is highly computerized, of course."</p><p>“通常都不会，不过万一出了问题，会有一些懂得电脑的专家从别处赶来。当然，一切都是高度电脑化的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The elevator came to a halt and they stepped out. A blast of heat struck them.</p><p>此时升降机停了下来，三人鱼贯而出，一阵热浪立刻扑来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its hot," said Seldon quite unnecessarily.</p><p>“真热。”谢顿多此一举地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, it is," said Tisalver. "Thats what makes Dahl so valuable as an energy source. The magma layer is nearer the surface here than it is anywhere else in the world. So you have to work in the heat."</p><p>“的确没错，”堤沙佛说，“这正是达尔贵为能源产地的原因。这里的岩浆层比全球各处都更接近地表，所以你得在酷热中工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How about air-conditioning?" said Dors.</p><p>“空调设备呢？”铎丝问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There is air-conditioning, but its a matter of expense. We ventilate and dehumidify and cool, but if we go too far, then were using up too much energy and the whole process becomes too expensive."</p><p>“是有空调设备，可是这和成本有关。我们利用空调来通风、除湿和降温，但如果我们做得太过分，就会用掉太多能量，整个过程就会变得太昂贵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tisalver stopped at a door at which he signaled. It opened to a blast of cooler air and he muttered, "We ought to be able to get someone to help show us around and hell control the remarks that Mistress Venabili will otherwise be the victim of……at least from the men."</p><p>堤沙佛停在一扇门前，并按下讯号钮。门开了之后，随即吸入一阵凉风。他喃喃说道：“我们应该可以找到什么人，带我们四下参观一番。他自会控制那些风言风语，否则凡纳比里夫人会蒙受……至少男工的言语不堪入耳。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Remarks wont embarrass me," said Dors.</p><p>“冷嘲热讽不会令我感到尴尬。”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They will embarrass me," said Tisalver.</p><p>“会令我感到尴尬。”堤沙佛说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A young man walked out of the office and introduced himself as Hano Linder. He resembled Tisalver quite closely, but Seldon decided that until he got used to the almost universal shortness, swarthiness, black hair, and luxuriant mustaches, he would not be able to see individual differences easily.</p><p>一名年轻男子从办公室走出来，自我介绍说他叫汉诺·林德。他长得和堤沙佛十分相像，但谢顿心里明白，在他尚未习惯几乎千篇一律的矮小身材、黝黑皮肤、黑色头发，以及浓密的八字胡之前，他无法轻易看出他们的个体差异。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Lindor said, "Ill be glad to show you around for what there is to see. Its not one of your spectaculars, you know." He addressed them all, but his eyes were fixed on Dors. He said, "Its not going to be comfortable. I suggest we remove our shirts."</p><p>林德说：“我很乐意带你们到值得看的地方逛一逛。但你们要知道，这可不是你们心目中的奇观。”他和他们三人说话，目光却固定在铎丝身上。“不会怎么舒服，我建议大家脱掉短衫。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its nice and cool in here," said Seldon.</p><p>“这里十分凉爽。”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course, but thats because were executives. Rank has its privileges. Out there we cant maintain air-conditioning at this level. Thats why they get paid more than I do. In fact, those are the best-paying jobs in Dahl, which is the only reason we get people to work down here. Even so, its getting harder to get heatsinkers all the time." He took a deep breath. "Okay, out into the soup." </p><p>“当然，但那是因为我们是管理人员，阶级自有其特权。在外面我们无法保持这么强的空调，这就是为什么他们领的薪水比我还多。事实上在达尔，它是薪资最高的工作，这正是我们这里找得到工人的唯一原因。即使如此，热闾工还是越来越难找。”他深深吸了一口气，“好，咱们钻进热锅去吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He removed his own shirt and tucked it into his waistband. Tisalver did the same and Seldon followed suit.</p><p>他自己脱掉短衫，塞进他的腰带。堤沙佛也照做不误，谢顿则有样学样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Linder glanced at Dors and said, "For your own comfort, Mistress, but its not compulsory."</p><p>林德瞥了铎丝一眼，说道：“这样你会比较舒服，夫人，但并非强迫性的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thats all right," said Dors and removed her shirt.</p><p>“没问题。”铎丝说完，便脱下她的短衫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her brassiere was white, unpadded, and showed considerable cleavage. </p><p>她的胸罩是白色的，没有衬里，中间有着可观的开口。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mistress, said Lindor, "Thats not……" He thought a moment, then shrugged and said, "All right. Well get by."</p><p>“夫人，”林德说，“那可不是……”他想了一会儿，然后耸耸肩。“没关系，我们过得了关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At first, Seldon was aware only of computers and machinery, huge pipes, flickering lights, and flashing screens.</p><p>起初，谢顿只注意到电脑与机械装置，包括巨大的输送管、明灭不定的灯光，以及闪烁的萤光幕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The overall light was comparatively dim, though individual sections of machinery were illuminated. Seldon looked up into the almost-darkness. He said, "Why isn't  it better lit?"</p><p>整体的光线相当黯淡，不过机件附近都有充足的照明。谢顿抬起头，望着近乎黑漆漆的环境说：“为何不开亮一点？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its lit well enough……where it should be," said Lindor. His voice was well modulated and he spoke quickly, but a little harshly. "Overall illumination is kept low for psychological reasons. Too bright is translated, in the mind, into heat. Complaints go up when we turn up the lights, even when the temperature is made to go down."</p><p>“已经够亮了……就此地而言。”林德说。他的声音充满抑扬顿挫；他说得很快，但口气有点严厉。“整体照明保持黯淡是基于心理因素，太亮的话，工人会在心中将光转换成热。要是我们把灯光调亮，即使降低温度，抱怨仍会升高。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "It seems to be well computerized. I should think the operations could be turned over to computers altogether. This sort of environment is made for artificial intelligence."</p><p>铎丝说：“这里似乎十分电脑化，我认为整个运作都能交由电脑负责。这种环境是人工智能的天下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perfectly right," said Lindor, "but neither can we take a chance on any failures. We need people on the spot if anything goes wrong. A malfunctioning computer can raise problems up to two thousand kilometers away."</p><p>“完全正确，”林德说，“可是我们不敢冒这个险。万一有任何不对劲，我们需要随时有人在场。一台故障的电脑所引起的问题，可以影响到两千公里之外。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So can human error. isn't  that so?" said Seldon.</p><p>“人为错误也一样糟，难道不是吗？”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh. yes, but with both people and computers on the job, computer error can be more quickly tracked down and corrected by people and, conversely, human error can be more quickly corrected by computers. What it amounts to is that nothing serious can happen unless human error and computer error take place simultaneously. And that hardly ever happens."</p><p>“喔，是的，不过既然人类和电脑一块工作，电脑的错误可以较快找出原因，再由人工进行矫正；反之，藉由电脑，人为的错误也能较快修正。这就等于说，除非同时出现人为错误和电脑错误，否则不会发生任何严重问题，而那种情况几乎从未发生过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hardly ever, but not never, eh? said Seldon. </p><p>“几乎从未，并不等于从来没有，啊？”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Almost never, but not never. Computers aren't what they used to be and neither are people."</p><p>“并非从来没有，而是几乎从来没有。电脑今非昔比，而人也一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thats the way it always seems," said Seldon, laughing slightly.</p><p>“世事似乎一向如此。”谢顿说完，轻轻笑了几声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, no. Im not talking memory. Im not talking good old days. Im talking statistics."</p><p>“不，不。我不是在怀旧，不是在说过去的美好时光，我说的是统计数据。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At this, Seldon recalled Hummin talking of the degeneration of the times.</p><p>听到这里，谢顿再度想起夫铭所说的：时代正在衰退。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"See what I mean?" said Lindor, his voice dropping. "Theres a bunch of people, at the C-3 level from the looks of them, drinking. Not one of them is at his or her post."</p><p>“懂得我的意思了吧？”林德的音量逐渐降低，“那边有一群人，从他们的样子看来，应该是在丙三层的。他们正在喝饮料，没一个在工作岗位上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What are they drinking?" asked Dors.</p><p>“他们在喝什么？”铎丝问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Special fluids for replacing electrolyte loss. Fruit juice."</p><p>“补充电解质流失的特殊饮料……果汁。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You cant blame them, can you?" said Dors indignantly. "In this dry heat, you would have to drink."</p><p>“你不能怪他们吧？”铎丝忿忿不平地说，“在这种又干又热的环境里，你当然得喝点东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you know how long a skilled C-3 can spin out a drink? And theres nothing to be done about it either. If we give them five-minute breaks for drinks and stagger them so they don't all congregate in a group, you simply stir up a rebellion."</p><p>“你可知道一个熟练的丙三工人，喝一罐饮料可以磨多少时间？而我们根本一点办法也没有。如果你只给他们五分钟，并且把大家的休息时间错开，好让他们不会聚成一群，你就等于煽动他们造反。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were approaching the group now. There were men and women (Dahl seemed to be a more or less amphisexual society) and both sexes were shirtless. The women wore devices that might be called brassieres, but they were strictly functional. They served to lift the breasts in order to improve ventilation and limit perspiration, but covered nothing.</p><p>现在他们正朝那群人走去。这些工人有男有女（达尔似乎多少是个两性平等的社会），不论男女皆未穿短衫。女性上身穿戴着一种装置，勉强能称为胸罩，但纯粹是功能性的。它的功用是撑起乳房，以增进通风效果，并降低排汗量，却什么也遮不住。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said in an aside to Seldon, "That makes sense, Hari. Im soaking wet there."</p><p>铎丝悄悄对谢顿说：“这样穿有道理，哈里，我那里已经湿透了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Take off your brassiere, then," said Seldon. "I wont lift a finger to stop you."</p><p>“那就脱下胸罩，”谢顿说，“我丝毫不会阻止你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Somehow," said Dors, "I guessed you wouldnt." She left her brassiere where it was.</p><p>“不知怎么回事，”铎丝说，“我就猜到你不会。”她还是决定让胸罩留在原处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were approaching the congregation of people……about a dozen of them.</p><p>他们渐渐接近那群人……总共有十来个。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "If any of them make rude remarks, I shall survive."</p><p>铎丝说：“如果他们之中有人冒出粗言粗语，我还挺得住。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you," said Lindor. "I cannot promise they wont……But Ill have to introduce you. If they get the idea that you two are inspectors and in my company, They'll become unruly. Inspectors are supposed to poke around on their own without anyone from management overseeing them." </p><p>“谢谢你，”林德说，“我无法保证他们不会……但我必须介绍你们一番。万一他们误以为你俩是督察员，而且由我陪同，他们会变得难以驾驭。督察员应该自己独立四处探访，不能有管理部门的人在旁监督。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He held up his arms. "Heatsinkers, I have two introductions to make. We have visitors from outside……two Outworlders, two scholars. Theyve got worlds running short on energy and theyve come here to see how we do it here in Dahl. They think they may learn something."</p><p>他举起双臂。“热闾工们，我来为你们介绍两个人。他们是来自外界的访客……两位外星人士，两位学者。他们的世界上能源日渐短缺，他们来到这里，来看看我们达尔是怎么做的。他们认为或许能学到些什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They'll learn how to sweat!" shouted a heatsinker and there was raucous laughter.</p><p>“他们会学到怎样流汗。”一名热闾工喊道，随即响起一阵刺耳的笑声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She's got a sweaty chest right now," shouted a woman, "covering up like that." </p><p>“那女的已经满胸是汗，”一名女工吼道，“竟然那样遮掩起来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors shouted back, "Id take it off, but mine cant compete with yours." The laughter turned good-natured.</p><p>铎丝吼了回去：“我很想脱掉，但我的胸部没法跟你比。”笑声立即转趋友善。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But one young man stepped forward, staring at Seldon with intense deep-set eyes, his face set into a humorless mask. He said, "I know you. Youre the mathematician."</p><p>不料一名年轻男工向前走来，一双深陷的眼睛紧紧盯着谢顿，他的脸孔则活脱是毫无表情的面具。他说：“我认识你，你是那个数学家。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He ran forward, inspecting Seldons face with eager solemnity. Automatically, Dors stepped in front of Seldon and Lindor stepped in front of her, shouting, "Back, heatsinker. Mind your manners."</p><p>他冲过来，一本正经地忙着审视谢顿的面孔。铎丝自然而然站到了谢顿前面，而林德则站到她身前，并且吼道：“退下去，热闾工，注意你的礼貌。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Wait! Let him talk to me. Why is everyone piling in front of me?"</p><p>谢顿说：“慢着！让我和他说话。怎么一个个都挤在我前面？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Lindor said in a low voice, "If any of them get close, youll find they don't smell like hothouse flowers."</p><p>林德压低声音说：“无论他们任何一个走近，你都会发觉他们的味道可不像温室的花朵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ill endure it," said Seldon brusquely. "Young man, what is it you want?"</p><p>“我受得了。”谢顿直率地说，“年轻人，你想要做什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My name is Amaryl. Yugo Amaryl. Ive seen you on holovision."</p><p>“我名叫阿马瑞尔，雨果·阿马瑞尔。我在全息电视上看过你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You might have, but what about it?"</p><p>“或许吧，可是又怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't remember your name."</p><p>“我不记得你的名字。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You don't have to."</p><p>“你不必记得。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You talked about something called psychohistory."</p><p>“你提到一种叫心理史学的东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You don't know how I wish I hadnt."</p><p>“你不知道我有多么后悔。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?"</p><p>“什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing. What is it you want?"</p><p>“没什么，你到底要做什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I want to talk to you. Just for a little while. Now."</p><p>“我想跟你谈谈，只要一下子就好，就现在吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked at Lindor, who shook his head firmly. "Not while hes on his shift."</p><p>谢顿望向林德，后者坚决地摇了摇头。“他值班时绝对不行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"When does your shift begin, Mr. Amaryl?" asked Seldon.</p><p>“阿马瑞尔先生，你从什么时候开始轮班？”谢顿问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sixteen hundred."</p><p>“1600时。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Can you see me tomorrow at fourteen hundred?"</p><p>“你能在明天1400时来见我吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure. Where?"</p><p>“当然可以，哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon turned to Tisalver. Would you permit me to see him in your place?"</p><p>谢顿转头望向堤沙佛。“你准我在你那里见他吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tisalver looked very unhappy. "Its not necessary. Hes just a heatsinker."</p><p>堤沙佛显得非常不高兴。“没这个必要，他只是个热闾工。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "He recognized my face. He knows something about me. He cant be just an anything. Ill see him in my room." And then, as Tisalvers face didn't soften, he added, "My room, for which rent is being paid. And youll be at work, out of the apartment."</p><p>谢顿说：“他认出我来，还知道我的一些事，他不可能只是个普通人。我要在我的房间见他。”然后，由于堤沙佛的表情并未软化，他又补充道，“是在我的房间，我定期付房租的那个房间。而且那时你正在上班，不在公寓里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tisalver said in a low voice, "Its not me, Master Seldon. Its my wife, Casilia. She wont stand for it."</p><p>堤沙佛低声道：“不是我的问题，谢顿老爷。而是我太太，凯西莉娅，她不会接受这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ill talk to her," said Seldon grimly. "Shell have to."</p><p>“我会跟她谈，”谢顿绷着脸说，“她一定得接受。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Casilia Tisalver opened her eyes wide. "A heatsinker? Not in my apartment."</p><p>凯西莉娅·堤沙佛杏眼圆睁。“热闾工？不准进我的公寓。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? Besides, hell be coming to my room," said Seldon. "At fourteen hundred."</p><p>“为什么不准？何况，他会直接到我的房间来。”谢顿说，“在1400时的时候。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I wont have it," said Mistress Tisalver. "This is what comes of going down to the heatsinks. Jirad was a fool."</p><p>“我就是不要，”堤沙佛夫人说，“这就是去热闾所招惹的麻烦，吉拉德是个笨蛋。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not at all, Mistress Tisalver. We went at my request and I was fascinated. I must see this young man, since that is necessary to my scholarly work."</p><p>“没这回事，堤沙佛夫人。热闾是在我要求下前去的，而且我叹为观止。我必须见这个年轻人，我的学术工作有这个需要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im sorry if it is, but I wont have it."</p><p>“果真如此的话，我感到很抱歉，但我就是不要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors Venabili raised her hand. "Hari, let me take care of this. Mistress Tisalver, if Dr. Seldon must see someone in his room this afternoon, the additional person naturally means additional rent. We understand that. For today, then, the rent on Dr. Seldons room will be doubled."</p><p>铎丝·凡纳比里举起右手。“哈里，让我来吧。堤沙佛夫人，如果谢顿博士今天下午必须在他的房间里见一个人，多一个人自然代表得多付房租。我们懂得这个道理，所以说，谢顿博士今天的房租将会加倍。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mistress Tisalver thought about it. "Well, thats decent of you, but its not only the credits. Theres the neighbors to think of. A sweaty, smelly heatsinker……"</p><p>堤沙佛夫人想了一想。“嗯，你们真是大方，但这不只是信用点的问题，我还得考虑邻居怎么想。一个满身是汗、臭气冲天的热闾工……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I doubt that hell be sweaty and smelly at fourteen hundred, Mistress Tisalver, but let me go on. Since Dr. Seldon must see him, then if he cant see him here, hell have to see him elsewhere, but we cant run here and there. That would be too inconvenient. Therefore, what we will have to do is to get a room elsewhere. It wont be easy and we don't want to do it, but we will have to. So we will pay the rent through today and leave and of course we will have to explain to Master Hummin why we have had to change the arrangements that he so kindly made for us."</p><p>“堤沙佛夫人，我不信他在1400时会满身是汗、臭气冲天，但请让我继续说下去。既然谢顿博士非见他不可，如果不能在这里见他，他们就必须找别的地方会面。可是我们不能跑来跑去，那样实在太不方便。因此，我们不得不在别处找个房间。这不是容易的事，我们也不想那样做，可是我们别无选择。所以我们会把房租付到今天，然后离开这里。当然啦，我们必须向夫铭老爷解释：他好心好意帮我们做的安排，我们为何无法领情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wait." Mistress Tisalvers face became a study of calculation. "We wouldnt like to disoblige Master Hummin……or you two. How long would this creature have to stay?"</p><p>“慢着，”堤沙佛夫人换成一副精打细算的模样，“我们不希望拂逆夫铭老爷……或是你们两位的心意。那东西得待多久？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hes coming at fourteen hundred. He must be at work at sixteen hundred. He will be here for less than two hours, perhaps considerably less. We will meet him outside, the two of us, and bring him to Dr. Seldons room. Any neighbors who see us will think he is an Outworlder friend of ours."</p><p>“他会在1400时抵达，又得在1600时上工。他在这里待不到两小时，也许还会短得多。我们两人会在外面迎接他，再把他带到谢顿博士的房间。任何邻居看到我们，都会认为他是我们的朋友，是外星人士。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mistress Tisalver nodded her head. "Then let it be as you say. Double rent for Master Seldons room for today and the heatsinker will visit just this one time."</p><p>堤沙佛夫人点了点头。“那就照你说的办吧。今天谢顿老爷的房租加倍，而且那热闾工只准来这么一次。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Just this one time," said Dors.</p><p>“下不为例。”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But later, when Seldon and Dors were sitting in her room, Dors said, "Why do you have to see him, Hari? Is interviewing a heatsinker important to psychohistory too?"</p><p>但是过了一会儿，当谢顿与铎丝一起坐在她的房间时，铎丝却说：“哈里，你为什么一定要见他？会晤一名热闾工对心理史学也很重要吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon thought he detected a small edge of sarcasm in her voice and he said tartly, "I don't have to base everything on this huge project of mine, in which I have very little faith anyway. I am also a human being with human curiosities. We were down in the heatsinks for hours and you saw what the working people there were like. They were obviously uneducated. They were low-level individuals……no play on words intended……and yet here was one who recognized me. He must have seen me on holovision on the occasion of the Decennial Convention and he remembered the word psychohistory. He strikes me as unusual……as out of place somehow……and I would like to talk to him."</p><p>从她的声音中，谢顿认为自己听出一点讥讽，于是他以锋利的口吻说：“我不必每件事都打着这个伟大计划的招牌，反正我对它并没有什么信心。我也是个有血有肉的人，具有人类的好奇心。我们在热闾待了几个小时，你也看到那些工人是什么样子。他们显然没受过教育，他们属于低下阶层……我不打算修饰文字……然而这个人却认出我来。他一定是在我出席十载会议时，从全息电视上看到我的，而且他还记得‘心理史学’这个名称。他令我感到很不寻常，至少是很不相衬，我希望能和他聊一聊。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because it pleases your vanity to have become known even to heatsinkers in Dahl?"</p><p>“因为连达尔的热闾工都认识你，满足了你的虚荣心？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well……perhaps. But it also piques my curiosity."</p><p>“这……或许吧。但也引起了我的好奇心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And how do you know he hasnt been briefed and intends to lead you into trouble as has happened before."</p><p>“你怎么知道他不是奉命而来，打算引你步入陷阱，就像前两次那样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon winced. "I wont let him run his fingers through my hair. In any case, were more nearly prepared now, aren't we? And Im sure youll be with me. I mean, you let me go Upperside alone, you let me go with Raindrop Forty-Three to the microfarms alone, and youre not going to do that again, are you?"</p><p>谢顿心头一凛。“我不会让他抚摸我的头发。无论如何，我们这回几乎有了心理准备，对不对？而且我能确定，你会待在我身边。我的意思是，你让我单独到上方去，又让我单独和雨点四十三到微生农场，但你再也不会这样做了，是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You can be absolutely sure I wont," said Dors.</p><p>“这点你可以绝对肯定。”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then, Ill talk to the young man and you can watch out for traps. I have every faith in you."</p><p>“好吧，那么让我和这个年轻人谈谈，你负责注意可疑的陷阱。我对你有百分之百的信心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl arrived a few minutes before 1400, looking warily about. His hair was neat and his thick mustache was combed and turned up slightly at the edges. His T-shirt was startlingly white. He did smell, but it was a fruity odor that undoubtedly came from the slightly overenthusiastic use of scent. He had a bag with him.</p><p>阿马瑞尔提前几分钟抵达，一面走一面谨慎地东张西望。他的头发相当整洁，浓密的八字胡经过梳理，两端微微向上翘起，身上的短衫则是白得惊人。他的确有一股味道，却是一种水果香味，无疑是由于香水用得稍嫌过度。此外，他随身带了一个袋子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon, who had been waiting outside for him, seized one elbow lightly, while Dors seized the other, and they moved rapidly into the elevator. Having reached the correct level, they passed through the apartment into Seldons room. </p><p>早就等在外面的谢顿轻轻抓住他一只手肘，铎丝则抓住另一只，然后三人便向升降机迅速走去。到了正确楼层之后，他们穿过公寓的外厅，朝谢顿的卧房直奔而去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl said in a low hangdog voice, "Nobody home, huh?"</p><p>阿马瑞尔卑微地低声道：“没有人在家，啊？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Everyone's busy," said Seldon neutrally. He indicated the only chair in the room, a pad directly on the floor.</p><p>“大家都在忙。”谢顿实事求是地说。然后，他指了指房里仅有的一把椅子，那其实是个直接放在地板上的坐垫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Amaryl. "I don't need that. One of you two use it." He squatted on the floor with a graceful downward motion.</p><p>“不，”阿马瑞尔说，“我不需要那个，你们哪位坐吧。”他以优雅的动作蹲坐到地板上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors imitated the movement, sitting on the edge of Seldons floor-based mattress, but Seldon dropped down rather clumsily, having to make use of his hands and unable, quite, to find a comfortable position for his legs. </p><p>铎丝模仿着那个动作，坐到那个坐垫旁边。谢顿的坠势却相当笨拙，不得不伸出双手帮忙，而且无法为双腿找到舒适的位置。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Well, young man, why do you want to see me?"</p><p>谢顿说：“好啦，年轻人，你为什么想见我？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because youre a mathematician. Youre the first mathematician I ever saw……close up……so I could touch him, you know."</p><p>“因为你是一位数学家，是我见到的第一位数学家……近距离见到，我甚至能碰到你，你知道我的意思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mathematicians feel like anyone else."</p><p>“数学家摸起来和其他人没有两样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not to me, Dr.……Seldon?"</p><p>“对我而言可不一样，谢……谢……谢顿博士？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thats my name."</p><p>“那正是我的名字。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl looked pleased. "I finally remembered……You see, I want to be a mathematician too."</p><p>阿马瑞尔显得很高兴。“我终于想起来了。你知道吗，我也想成为一位数学家。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Very good. Whats stopping you?"</p><p>“非常好。有什么困难吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl suddenly frowned. "Are you serious?"</p><p>阿马瑞尔突然皱起眉头。“你这话认真吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I presume something is stopping you. Yes, Im serious."</p><p>“我猜想你一定有什么困难。是的，我很认真。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whats stopping me is Im a Dahlite, a heatsinker on Dahl. I don't have the money to get an education and I cant get the credits to get an education. A real education, I mean. All they taught me was to read and cipher and use a computer and then I knew enough to be a heatsinker. But I wanted more So I taught myself."</p><p>“困难就在于我是达尔人，而且是达尔的热闾工。我没钱接受教育，也赚不到足够的信用点受教育，我的意思是‘真正的教育’。他们教我的只不过是阅读、计算，以及怎样使用电脑，然后我就足以当个热闾工。可是我要学更多的东西，所以我一直在自修。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In some ways, thats the best kind of teaching. How did you do that?"</p><p>“就某个角度而言，那是最好的教育方式。你是怎么做的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I knew a librarian She was willing to help me She was a very nice woman and she showed me how to use computers for learning mathematics. And she set up a software system that would connect me with other libraries. Id come on my days off and on mornings after my shift Sometimes shed lock me in her private room so I wouldnt be bothered by people coming in or she would let me in when the library was closed. She didn't know mathematics herself, but she helped me all she could She was oldish, a widow lady. Maybe she thought of me as a kind of son or something. She didn't have children of her own."</p><p>“我认识一名图书馆员，她乐意帮助我。她是个非常好心的妇人，教导我如何使用电脑来学习数学。她还建了一个软件系统，让我能联线到其他图书馆。我总是在假日以及早晨下班后到那儿去。有时她会把我锁在她自己的房间，以免我被其他人打扰，而图书馆关闭时她也会让我进来。她自己完全不懂数学，但她尽一切力量帮助我。她有些年纪了，是个寡妇。也许她把我当成她的儿子，她自己没有子女。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Maybe, thought Seldon briefly, there was some other emotion involved too, but he put the thought away. None of his business.)</p><p>也许，谢顿突然想到，这里面还牵涉到其他的情感。但他随即将这个想法抛到脑后，反正和他毫无关系。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I liked number theory," said Amaryl. "I worked some things out from what I learned from the computer and from the book-films it used to teach me mathematics. I came up with some new things that werent in the book-films." </p><p>“我喜欢‘数论’。”阿马瑞尔说，“我根据自己从电脑以及影视书所学到的数学，自己做出一些结果。我得到一些新东西，是那些影视书里没有的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon raised his eyebrows. "Thats interesting. Like what?"</p><p>谢顿扬起眉毛。“真有意思，比如说什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ive brought some of them to you. Ive never showed them to anyone. The people around me……" He shrugged. "Theyd either laugh or be annoyed. Once I tried to tell a girl I knew, but she just said I was weird and wouldnt see me anymore Is it all right for me to show them to you?"</p><p>“我特地带来一些，我从来没有给任何人看过。我周围那些人……”他耸了耸肩，“他们不是大笑就是嫌烦。有一次，我把我知道的试着告诉一个女孩，但她只是说我莫名其妙，以后再也不要见我。我拿给你看真的没关系吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quite all right. Believe me "</p><p>“真的没关系，请相信我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon held out his hand aaaaafter a brief hesitation, Amaryl handed him the bag he was carrying.</p><p>谢顿伸出一只手。经过短暂的犹豫后，阿马瑞尔将身边的袋子交给了他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a long time, Seldon looked over Amaryls papers. The work was naive in the extreme, but he allowed no smile to cross his face He followed the demonstrations, not one of which was new, of course……or even nearly new……or of any importance.</p><p>接下来好长一段时间，谢顿都在翻阅阿马瑞尔的稿件。虽然内容极其天真，但他刻意避免掠现任何笑容。他一个一个论证读下去，当然，其中没有任何创见……甚至接近创见的也没有，更找不到任何重要的结果。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But that didn't matter.</p><p>不过并没有关系。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked up. "Did you do all of this yourself?"</p><p>谢顿抬起头。“这些全是你自己做出来的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl, looking more than half-frightened, nodded his head. </p><p>阿马瑞尔看来有七八分吓呆了，只是一个劲点头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon extracted several sheets. "What made you think of this?" His finger ran down a line of mathematical reasoning.</p><p>谢顿抽出几页来。“你是怎么想到的？”他指着某一行数学推论。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl looked it over, frowned, and thought about it Then he explained his line of thinking.</p><p>阿马瑞尔仔细看了看，皱起了眉头，又想了一想。然后，他开始解释自己的思路。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon listened and said, "Did you ever read a book by Anat Bigell?"</p><p>谢顿听完之后说：“你曾经读过艾南·比格尔写的一本书吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On number theory?"</p><p>“有关数论的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The title was Mathematical Deduction. It wasn't about number theory, particularly."</p><p>“书名是《数学演绎法》，并不是专讲数论的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl shook his head. "I never heard of him. Im sorry."</p><p>阿马瑞尔摇了摇头。“很抱歉，我从来没听过这个人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He worked out this theorem of yours three hundred years ago.</p><p>“三百年前，他就推出了这个定理。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl looked stricken. "I didn't know that."</p><p>阿马瑞尔似乎受到当头棒喝。“我不知道这件事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im sure you didnt. You did it more cleverly, though. Its not rigorous, but……"</p><p>“我确定你不知道。不过，你的做法比较高明。虽然不够严密，可是……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What do you mean, rigorous?"</p><p>“你所谓的‘严密’是什么意思？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It doesnt matter." Seldon put the papers back together in a sheaf, restored it to the bag, and said, "Make several copies of all this. Take one copy, have it dated by an official computer, and place it under computerized seal. My friend here, Mistress Venabili, can get you into Streeling University without tuition on some sort of scholarship. Youll have to start at the beginning and take courses in other subjects than mathematics, but……"</p><p>“这没有关系。”谢顿将稿件重新扎成一捆，再放回那个袋子里。“把这些整个复印几份，然后找个官方电脑，将其中一份打上日期，并且加上电脑化封印。我的这位朋友，凡纳比里夫人，能够帮你申请到某种奖学金，让你免费进入斯璀璘大学就读。你必须一切从头学起，还要修习数学以外的其他课程，但是……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By now Amaryl had caught his breath. "Into Streeling University? They wont take me "</p><p>阿马瑞尔突然倒抽一口气。“进斯璀璘大学？他们不会收我的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? Dors, you can arrange it, cant you?"</p><p>“为什么不会？铎丝，你能帮他安排，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im sure I can."</p><p>“我确定可以。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, you cant," said Amaryl hotly. "They wont take me Im from Dahl "</p><p>“不，你办不到。”阿马瑞尔激动地说，“他们不会收我的，我是个达尔人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well?"</p><p>“那又怎样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They wont take people from Dahl "</p><p>“他们不会收达尔的同胞。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked at Dors. "Whats he talking about?"</p><p>谢顿望向铎丝。“他在说些什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors shook her head. "I really don't know."</p><p>铎丝摇了摇头。“我真的不知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl said, "Youre an Outworlder, Mistress How long have you been at Streeling?"</p><p>阿马瑞尔说：“夫人，你是一位外星人士。你在斯璀璘待了多久？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A little over two years, Mr. Amaryl."</p><p>“两年多一点，阿马瑞尔先生。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have you ever seen Dahlites there……short, curly black hair, big mustaches?"</p><p>“你在那里见过任何达尔人吗……矮个子，黑色鬈发，粗大的八字胡？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There are students with all kinds of appearances."</p><p>“那里各式各样造型的学生都有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But no Dahlites. Look again the next time youre there."</p><p>“可是没有达尔人，下次你再仔细看一看。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?" said Seldon.</p><p>“为什么没有？”谢顿问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They don't like us. We look different. They don't like our mustaches."</p><p>“他们不喜欢我们，我们看来不一样，他们不喜欢我们的八字胡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You can shave your……" but Seldons voice died under the others furious glance.</p><p>“你可以剃掉你的……”对方激愤的目光，让谢顿的声音陡然中断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Never. Why should I? My mustache is my manhood."</p><p>“休想，我为什么要那样做？八字胡是我的男性象征。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You shave your beard. Thats your manhood too."</p><p>“你剃掉了下面的胡须，那同样是你的男性象征。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To my people it is the mustache."</p><p>“对我的同胞而言，八字胡才是。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked at Dors again and murmured, "Bald heads, mustaches……madness."</p><p>谢顿再度望向铎丝，并低声抱怨：“光头，八字胡……愚昧行为。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?" said Amaryl angrily.</p><p>“什么？”阿马瑞尔气呼呼地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing. Tell me what else they don't like about Dahlites."</p><p>“没什么。告诉我，达尔人还有什么是他们不喜欢的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They make up things not to like. They say we smell. They say were dirty. They say we steal. They say were violent. They say were dumb."</p><p>“他们创造出许多不喜欢的事。他们说我们有臭味，说我们肮脏，说我们偷窃，说我们暴戾，还说我们愚蠢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why do they say all this?"</p><p>“他们为何这样说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because its easy to say it and it makes them feel good. Sure, if we work in the heatsinks, we get dirty and smelly. If were poor and held down, some of us steal and get violent. But that isn't  the way it is with all of us. How about those tall yellow-hairs in the Imperial Sector who think they own the Galaxy……no, they do own the Galaxy. don't they ever get violent? don't they steal sometimes? If they did my job, theyd smell the way I do. If they had to live the way I have to, theyd get dirty too."</p><p>“因为说说很容易，而且会让他们觉得舒服。如果在热闾里头工作，我们当然会变脏变臭。如果贫穷而又不得翻身，有些人难免就会行窃，并且染上暴戾之气，不过并非我们大家都是那样。那些居住在皇区，认为他们拥有整个银河……不，的确拥有整个银河的黄发高个子又有什么了不起。他们绝不会有暴戾之气吗？他们从来不偷窃吗？假使让他们做我的工作，他们同样会发出臭味；假使他们必须过着像我一样的生活，他们也会变得肮脏。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Who denies that there are people of all kinds in all places?" said Seldon.</p><p>“谁能否认世界上有形形色色不同的人？”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No one argues the matter! They just take it for granted. Master Seldon, Ive got to get away from Trantor. I have no chance on Trantor, no way of earning credits, no way of getting an education, no way of becoming a mathematician, no way of becoming any thing but what they say I am……a worthless nothing." This last was said in frustration……and desperation.</p><p>“没人议论这一点！他们视之为理所当然。谢顿老爷，我一定得离开川陀。我在川陀没有任何机会，无法赚到信用点，无法接受教育，无法成为一位数学家，无法成为任何人物，只能是他们所谓的……一个没用的废物。”最后半句，他是在挫折与绝望中说出来的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon tried to be reasonable. "The person Im renting this room from is a Dahlite. He has a clean job. Hes educated."</p><p>谢顿试图和他说理。“租给我这间房的就是个达尔人，他有个干净的工作，而且受过教育。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh sure," said Amaryl passionately. "There are some. They let a few do it so that they can say it can be done. And those few can live nicely as long as they stay in Dahl. Let them go outside and They'll see how theyre treated. And while theyre in here they make themselves feel good by treating the rest of us like dirt. That makes them yellow-hairs in their own eyes. What did this nice person youre renting this room from say when you told him you were bringing in a heatsinker? What did he say I would be like? Theyre gone now……wouldnt be in the same place with me."</p><p>“喔，当然。”阿马瑞尔慷慨激昂地说，“是有些这种人。他们让少数人出人头地，这样他们就能说那是办得到的。那些少数人只要不离开达尔，他们就能活得很好。让他们到外面去一趟，他们就会晓得将受到何等待遇。关起门来的时候，他们把我们其他人视同粪土，这样他们就会觉得舒服。在他们自己眼中，他们也成了黄发阶级。租给你这个房间的那位好好先生，当你告诉他要带一个热闾工进来的时候，他有没有说些什么？他有没有说我像个什么？他们现在都走光了……不愿意和我待在同一个地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon moistened his lips. "I wont forget you. Ill see to it that youll get off Trantor and into my own University in Helicon……once Im back there myself."</p><p>谢顿舔了舔嘴唇。“我不会忘记你的。一旦我自己回到赫利肯，我保证会设法让你离开川陀，进入我的那所大学就读。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you promise that? Your word of honor? Even though Im a Dahlite?"</p><p>“你答应这件事吗？你以荣誉担保？虽然我是个达尔人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The fact that youre a Dahlite is unimportant to me. The fact that you are already a mathematician is! But I still cant quite grasp what youre telling me. I find it impossible to believe that there would be such unreasoning feeling against harmless people."</p><p>“你是不是达尔人对我并不重要，重要的是你已经是一位数学家！但是你告诉我的这些事，我仍然无法完全理解。对于善良的族群竟有如此非理性的情绪，我觉得实在难以置信。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl said bitterly, "Thats because youve never had any occasion to interest yourself in such things. It can all pass right under your nose and you wouldnt smell a thing because it doesnt affect you. " </p><p>阿马瑞尔以挖苦的口吻说：“那是因为你从来没有任何机会，让自己对这种事发生兴趣。由于对你毫无影响，它们从你的鼻端通过，你却可以什么也闻不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "Mr. Amaryl, Dr. Seldon is a mathematician like you and his head can sometimes be in the clouds. You must understand that. I am a historian, however. I know that it isn't  unusual to have one group of people look down upon another group. There are peculiar and almost ritualistic hatreds that have no rational justification and that can have their serious historical influence. Its too bad."</p><p>铎丝说：“阿马瑞尔先生，谢顿博士和你一样是数学家，他的脑袋有时会在九霄云外，这点你必须了解。然而，我是一位历史学家。在我看来，一群人瞧不起另一群人并没有什么不寻常。有些特殊的、几乎已成惯例的仇恨，根本就没有任何理性依据，而且会在历史上造成严重的影响。这实在太糟了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl said, "Saying something is too bad is easy. You say you disapprove, which makes you a nice person, and then you can go about your own business and not be interested anymore. Its a lot worse than too bad. Its against everything decent and natural. Were all of us the same, yellow-hairs and black-hairs, tall and short, Easterners, Westerners, Southerners, and Outworlders. Were all of us, you and I and even the Emperor, descended from the people of Earth, aren't we?"</p><p>阿马瑞尔道：“说某件事‘太糟了’倒很容易。你说你不敢苟同，这就使你成了好人，然后你就可以专心自己的事，再也不关心这个问题。这要比‘太糟了’还要糟得多，它和所有高尚而自然的事物背道而驰。我们大家都一样，不论是黄发或黑发，高或矮，东方人、西方人、南方人或外星人士。我们都是一家人，无论你我，甚至皇帝，通通是地球人的后裔，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Descended from what?" asked Seldon. He turned to look at Dors, his eyes wide.</p><p>“什么的后裔？”谢顿问道。他转身望向铎丝，双眼张得老大。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"From the people of Earth!" shouted Amaryl. "The one planet on which human beings originated."</p><p>“地球！”阿马瑞尔喊道。“诞生人类的那颗行星。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"One planet? Just one planet?"</p><p>“一颗行星？只有一颗行星？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The only planet. Sure. Earth."</p><p>“唯一的行星，这还用说，就是地球。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"When you say Earth, you mean Aurora, don't you?"</p><p>“你所谓的地球，指的是奥罗拉吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Aurora? Whats that?……I mean Earth. Have you never heard of Earth?"</p><p>“奥罗拉？那是什么？我指的就是地球。你从来没听过地球吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Seldon. "Actually not."</p><p>谢顿答道：“其实不能算有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its a mythical world," began Dors, "that……"</p><p>“它是个神话世界……”铎丝说到一半便被打断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its not mythical. It was a real planet."</p><p>“不是神话，它是一颗真实的行星。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sighed. "Ive heard this all before. Well, lets go through it again. Is there a Dahlite book that tells of Earth?"</p><p>谢顿叹了一口气。“我以前也听过这一套。好吧，让我们从头再来一遍。达尔是不是有一本书，里面提到地球？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?"</p><p>“什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Some computer software, then?"</p><p>“那么，某种电脑软件？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know what youre talking about."</p><p>“我不知道你到底在说些什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Young man, where did you hear about Earth?"</p><p>“年轻人，你是从哪里听说地球的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My dad told me. Everyone knows about it."</p><p>“我爸爸告诉我的。人人都听说过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is there anyone who knows about it especially? Did they teach you about it in school?"</p><p>“有没有什么人对它特别了解？你们在学校里学过吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They never said a word about it there."</p><p>“那里对地球一字不提。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then how do people know about it?"</p><p>“那么人们是怎么知道的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl shrugged his shoulders with an air of being uselessly badgered over nothing. "Everyone just does. If you want stories about it, theres Mother Rittah. I haven't heard that She's died yet."</p><p>阿马瑞尔耸了耸肩，仿佛面对着一个无中生有的烦人问题。“就是人人都知道。如果你想听这方面的故事，可以去找瑞塔嬷嬷，我还没听到她去世的消息。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Your mother? Wouldnt you know……"</p><p>“你妈妈？你怎么不知道……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She's not my mother. Thats just what they call her. Mother Rittah. She's an old woman. She lives in Billibotton. Or used to."</p><p>“她并不是我妈妈，只是他们都这样叫她，瑞塔嬷嬷。她是个老妇人，住在脐眼，至少以前住在那里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wheres that?"</p><p>“那地方在哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Down in that direction," said Amaryl, gesturing vaguely.</p><p>“朝那个方向一直走。”阿马瑞尔说，一面做了一个含糊的手势。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How do I get there?"</p><p>“我该怎么去那里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Get there? You don't want to get there. Youd never come back."</p><p>“去那里？你不会想去那里，否则你将有去无回。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?"</p><p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Believe me. You don't want to go there."</p><p>“相信我，你不会想去那里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But Id like to see Mother Rittah."</p><p>“可是我希望见见瑞塔嬷嬷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl shook his head. "Can you use a knife?"</p><p>阿马瑞尔摇了摇头。“你会用刀吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For what purpose? What kind of knife?"</p><p>“做什么用？什么样的刀？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A cutting knife. Like this. Amaryl reached down to the belt that held his pants tight about his waist. A section of it came away and from one end there flashed out a knife blade, thin, gleaming, and deadly. </p><p>“切东西的刀，像这一把。”阿马瑞尔伸手向下，抓住那条紧紧系着裤子的皮带。皮带的一节随即脱落，一端闪出一把利刃，它又薄又亮，足以取人性命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dorss hand immediately came down hard upon his right wrist. </p><p>铎丝立刻出手，用力抓住他的右腕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Amaryl laughed. "I wasn't planning to use it. I was just showing it to you." He put the knife back in his belt. "You need one in self-defense and if you don't have one or if you have one but don't know how to use it, youll never get out of Billibotton alive. Anyway"……he suddenly grew very grave and intent……"are you really serious, Master Seldon, about helping me get to Helicon?"</p><p>阿马瑞尔哈哈大笑。“我不是要动手，只是亮出来给你们看看。”他将刀子插回皮带，“你需要一把来自卫，如果你没有，或者虽有却不会使用，你就无法活着离开脐眼。总之，”他忽然变得非常严肃，非常急切。“你说要帮助我去赫利肯，此话的确当真吗，谢顿老爷？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Entirely serious. Thats a promise. Write down your name and where you can be reached by hypercomputer. You have a code, I suppose."</p><p>“百分之百当真，那是我的承诺。写下你的名字，还有怎样用超波电脑联络到你。我想你该有址码吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My shift in the heatsinks has one. Will that do?"</p><p>“我在热闾的岗位上有一个，可以吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes."</p><p>“可以。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then," said Amaryl, looking up earnestly at Seldon, "this means I have my whole future riding on you, Master Seldon, so please don't go to Billibotton. I cant afford to lose you now."</p><p>“好啦，”阿马瑞尔一面说，一面抬起头，一本正经地望着谢顿。“谢顿老爷，这就代表我的未来全部寄托在你身上，所以拜托你千万别去脐眼。万一马上就失去你，我可承受不起这种损失。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He turned beseeching eyes on Dors and said softly, "Mistress Venabili, if hell listen to you, don't let him go. Please."</p><p>他又将恳求的目光转向铎丝，并轻声道，“凡纳比里夫人，如果他肯听你的，就不要让他去。拜托了！”</p></div>
