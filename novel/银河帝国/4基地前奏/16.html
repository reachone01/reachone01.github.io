<div class='layout'><p>16 Officers</p><p>第16章 警官</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>RAYCH…………According to Hari Seldon, the original meeting with Raych was entirely accidental. He was simply a gutter urchin from whom Seldon had asked directions. But his life, from that moment on, continued to be intertwined with that of the great mathematician until ...</p><p>芮奇：……根据哈里·谢顿的说法，最初与芮奇相遇纯属偶然。他只是个贫民区的顽童，而谢顿只是向他问路。但从那一刻起，他的人生就和那位大数学家纠缠在一起，直到……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p><p>……《银河百科全书》</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The next morning, dressed from the waist down, having washed and shaved, Seldon knocked on the door that led to Dorss adjoining room and said in a moderate voice, "Open the door, Dors."</p><p>第二天早上，谢顿刚刚梳洗完毕，腰部以上还完全赤裸，就敲着通往隔壁铎丝房间的那扇门，以适度的音量说：“开门，铎丝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She did. The short reddish-gold curls of her hair were still wet and she too was dressed only from the waist down.</p><p>她照做了。她满头金里透红的鬈曲短发还湿淋淋的，而且上身同样完全赤裸。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon stepped back in embarrassed alarm. Dors looked down at the swell of her breasts indifferently and wrapped a towel around her head. "What is it?" she asked.</p><p>谢顿尴尬万分地向后退去。铎丝毫不在意地低头看了看鼓胀的乳房，再把一条毛巾裹在头上。“什么事？”她问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, looking off to his right, "I was going to ask you about Wye."</p><p>谢顿将头偏向右侧，说道：“我正要向你请教卫荷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said very naturally, "About why in connection with what? And for goodness sake, don't make me talk to your ear. Surely, youre not a virgin."</p><p>铎丝非常自然地说：“为何怎么样？看在老天的份上，别让我对着你的耳朵说话。不用说，你当然不是处男。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said in a hurt tone, "I was merely trying to be polite. If you don't mind, I certainly dont. And its not why about what. I'm asking about the Wye Sector."</p><p>谢顿以感伤的语调说：“我只是试图保持礼数。只要你不在意，我当然也不会。我说的不是为何怎么样，我是在问你有关卫荷区的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why do you want to know? Or, if you prefer: Why Wye?"</p><p>“你为何想知道？或者你喜欢这么说：为何问卫荷？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Look, Dors, I'm serious. Every once in a while, the Wye Sector is mentioned……the Mayor of Wye, actually. Hummin mentioned him, you did, Davan did. I don't know anything about either the sector or the Mayor."</p><p>“听好，铎丝，我很认真。每隔一阵子，就会有人提起卫荷区……事实上，是提到那个卫荷区长。夫铭提到过他，你提到过，达凡也提到过。我却对这个区和这个区长都一无所知。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not a native Trantorian either, Hari. I know very little, but youre welcome to what I do know. Wye is near the south pole……quite large, very populous……"</p><p>“哈里，我也不是土生土长的川陀人。我知道得非常少，不过欢迎你分享我所知道的一切。卫荷接近南极……面积相当大，人口非常多……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Very populous at the south pole?"</p><p>“在南极还能人口非常多？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Were not on Helicon, Hari. Or on Cinna either. This is Trantor. Everything is underground and underground at the poles or underground at the equator is pretty much the same. Of course, I imagine they keep their day-night arrangements rather extreme……long days in their summer, long nights in their winter……almost as it would be on the surface. The extremes are just affectation; theyre proud of being polar."</p><p>“哈里，我们不是在赫利肯，也不是在锡纳上。这里是川陀，万事万物都在地底，而两极的地底和赤道的地底可说差不多。当然，我猜想他们有着相当极端的昼夜分布……夏天的白昼很长，冬天则刚好相反，几乎和地表的情形一样。这种极端纯属矫揉造作，其实他们是以身居极地自豪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But Upperside they must be cold, indeed."</p><p>“可是他们的上方一定真的很冷。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh yes. The Wye Upperside is snow and ice, but it doesnt lie as thickly there as you might think. If it did, it might crush the dome, but it doesnt and that is the basic reason for Wyes power."</p><p>“喔，没错。卫荷的上方冰雪交加，可是冰雪堆积得不如你想象中那么厚。果真如此的话，就可能会压垮穹顶，但事实则不然，这正是卫荷握有大权的基本原因。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She turned to her mirror, removed the towel from her head, and threw the dry-net over her hair, which, in a matter of five seconds, gave it a pleasant sheen. She said, "You have no idea how glad I am not to be wearing a skincap," as she put on the upper portion of her clothing.</p><p>她转身面向镜子，将毛巾从头上取下，再将“干发网”罩在头上。不过五秒钟，她的头发便呈现悦人的光泽。她一面说：“你难以想象我多庆幸摆脱了人皮帽。”一面套上了衣服。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What has the ice layer to do with Wyes power?"</p><p>“冰层和卫荷的权力有什么关系？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Think about it. Forty billion people use a great deal of power and every calorie of it eventually degenerates into heat and has to be gotten rid of. Its piped to the poles, particularly to the south pole, which is the more developed of the two, and is discharged into space. It [melts] most of the ice in the process and I'm sure that accounts for Trantors clouds and rains, no matter how much the meteorology boggins insist that things are more complicated than that."</p><p>“想想看，四百亿居民每天消耗大量能源，每一卡的能量最终都会退化成热量，而且必须设法排除。这些热量全被输送到两极，尤其是开发得较好的南极，然后排放到太空去。在这个过程中，它融化了大部分的冰。我确定这正是川陀上空云雨的来源，不论那些气象学究如何坚决主张实际情形并没那么简单。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does Wye make use of the power before discharging it?"</p><p>“在将这些热量排放之前，卫荷有没有加以利用？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They may, for all I know. I haven't the slightest idea, by the way, as to the technology involved in discharging the heat, but I'm talking about political power. If Dahl were to stop producing usable energy, that would certainly inconvenience Trantor, but there are other sectors that produce energy and can up their production and, of course, there is stored energy in one form or another. Eventually, Dahl would have to be dealt with, but there would be time. Wye, on the other hand……"</p><p>“据我所知，他们也许有。顺便告诉你，关于排放热量的科技，我连最粗浅的概念都没有，但我所说的是政治上的权力。假如达尔停止生产可用的能源，当然会使整个川陀感到不便，可是还有其他生产能源的行政区，它们可以提高产量。此外，当然，还有种种的储备能源可以救急。达尔的问题终究得解决，不过总有缓冲时间。反之，卫荷……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes?"</p><p>“怎么样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, Wye gets rid of at least 90 percent of all the heat developed on Trantor and there is no substitute. If Wye were to shut down its heat emission, the temperature would start going up all over Trantor."</p><p>“嗯，川陀所产生的各种热量，至少百分之九十由卫荷负责排放，没有任何替代管道。假如卫荷将热量发射全部关闭，整个川陀的温度便会开始上升。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In Wye too."</p><p>“卫荷本身也会。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"[Yes], but since Wye is at the south pole, it can arrange an influx of cold air. It wouldnt do much good, but Wye would last longer than the rest of Trantor. The point is, then, that Wye is a very touchy problem for the Emperor and the Mayor of Wye is……or at least can be……extremely powerful."</p><p>“啊，可是既然卫荷位于南极，它就能设法导入冷空气。这并不会有太大的作用，但卫荷会比川陀其他各处撑得更久。所以结论是，对皇帝而言，卫荷是一个非常棘手的问题，而卫荷区长是……至少可以是极有权力的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what kind of a person is the present Mayor of Wye?"</p><p>“现任卫荷区长又是个什么样的人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That I don't know. What Ive occasionally heard would make it seem that he is very old and pretty much a recluse, but hard as a hypership hull and still cleverly maneuvering for power."</p><p>“这点我不知道。根据我偶尔听来的传闻，他似乎非常老迈，而且几乎是个隐士，但他和超空间飞船一样刚硬，而且仍在用高明的手段谋取权力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, I wonder? If hes that old, he couldnt hold the power for long."</p><p>“为什么？我不明白，既然他那么老了，就不能再掌握多久的权力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Who knows, Hari? A lifelong obsession, I suppose. Or else its the game……the maneuvering for power, without any real longing for the power itself. Probably if he had the power and took over Demerzels place or even the Imperial throne itself, he would feel disappointed because the game would be over. Of course he might, if he was still alive, begin the subsequent game of keeping power, which might be just as difficult and just as satisfying."</p><p>“哈里，谁晓得呢？一种终生的沉迷吧，我这么想。或者它是个游戏……只是为了谋取权力，并非真正渴求权力的本质。假如他夺权成功，取代了丹莫刺尔的位置，甚至自己登上皇位，说不定他反而会感到失望，因为这场游戏就结束了。当然啦，倘若那时他还活着，他或许会开始下一个游戏，那就是固守权力。这也许和前一个游戏同样困难，因而同样会带来成就感。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "It strikes me that no one could possibly want to be Emperor."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“这使我有一种感想，不可能有人想要当皇帝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No sane person would, I [free], but the Imperial wish, as it is frequently called, is like a disease that, when caught, drives out sanity. And the closer you get to high office, the more likely you are to catch the disease. With each ensuing promotion……"</p><p>“我同意，有理智的人都不会。但是这种所谓的‘皇帝梦’就像一种疾病，一旦染上就会使人丧失理智。而愈接近高位，就愈有可能染上这种疾病。随着一次又一次的晋升……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The disease grows still more acute. Yes, I can see that. But it also seems to me that Trantor is so huge a world, so interlocking in its needs and so conflicting in its ambitions, that it makes up the major part of the inability of the Emperor to rule. Why doesnt he just leave Trantor and establish himself on some simpler world?"</p><p>“这种疾病就会变得更急性。没错，这点我明白。但我还有另一个感想，川陀是如此庞大的一个世界，众人的需求是如此牵一发动全身，众人的野心是如此冲突不断，使它成为皇帝治下最大的不稳定因素。他为何不干脆离开川陀，迁都到某个较单纯的世界呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors laughed. "You wouldnt ask that if you knew your history. Trantor is the Empire through thousands of years of custom. An Emperor who is not at the Imperial Palace is not the Emperor. He is a place, even more than a person." </p><p>铎丝哈哈大笑。“倘若你了解历史，就不会问这个问题。根据上万年的惯例，川陀就等于帝国。一个皇帝若不在皇宫中，他就不算是个皇帝。皇帝不像是一个人，反而比较像一个地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sank into silence, his face rigid, and after a while Dors asked, "Whats the matter, Hari?"</p><p>谢顿陷入沉默，面孔也变得刚硬。过了一会儿，铎丝问道：“哈里，怎么回事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm thinking," he said in a muffled voice. "Ever since you told me that hand-on-thigh story, Ive had fugitive thoughts that……Now your remark about the Emperor being a place rather than a person seems to have struck a chord."</p><p>“我在寻思。”他以含糊的声音说，“自从你告诉我那个毛手毛脚的故事之后，我就有一种飘忽的想法。现在你又提到皇帝比较像个地方，而不像一个人，似乎刚好起了共鸣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What kind of chord?"</p><p>“什么样的共鸣？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "I'm still thinking. I may be all wrong." His glance at Dors sharpened, his eyes coming into focus. "In any case, we ought to go down and have breakfast. Were late and I don't think Mistress Tisalver is in a good enough humor to have it brought in for us."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“我仍在寻思，或许我全搞错了。”他瞥向铎丝的目光转趋尖锐，他的视线则重新聚焦。“无论如何，我们该下去吃早餐了。我们已经晚啦，我想堤沙佛夫人可没有那么好的心情，会帮我们把早餐端进来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You optimist," said Dors. "My own feeling is that shes not in a good enough humor to want us to stay……breakfast or not. She wants us out of here."</p><p>“你是个乐天派。”铎丝说，“我自己的感觉是，她没有那么好的心情，会想让我们留下来……不论有没有早餐。她想要让我们离开这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That may be, but were paying her."</p><p>“或许如此，但我们让她有钱可赚。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but I suspect she hates us enough by now to scorn our credits."</p><p>“没错，但我怀疑她现在恨我们入骨，根本不屑赚我们的信用点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps her husband Will feel a bit more affectionate concerning the rent."</p><p>“她的丈夫也许会对房租比较难分难舍一点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If he has a single word to say, Hari, the only person who would be more surprised than me to hear it would be Mistress Tisalver……Very well, I'm ready."</p><p>“他若有任何意见，哈里，恐怕只有堤沙佛夫人会比我更惊讶了。很好，我准备好了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And they moved down the stairs to the Tisalver portion of the apartment to find the lady in question waiting for them with less than breakfast……and with considerably more too.</p><p>于是他们走下楼梯，来到堤沙佛一家在这栋公寓的活动范围，发现两人所讨论的那位女士正等在那里……没有准备早餐，但准备了一个更大的惊奇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Casilia Tisalver stood ramrod straight with a tight smile on her round face and her dark eyes glinting. Her husband was leaning moodily against the wall. In the center of the room were two men who were standing stiffly upright, as though they had noticed the cushions on the floor but scorned them. </p><p>凯西莉娅·堤沙佛硬邦邦地直直站在那里，一张圆脸带着僵硬的笑容，一双黑眼珠闪闪发光。她的丈夫则闷闷不乐地倚在墙边。房间正中央还有两个人，也都直挺挺地站着，仿佛他们早已注意到地板上的坐垫，只是不屑坐在上面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Both had the dark crisp hair and the chick black mustache to be expected of Dahlites. Both were thin and both were dressed in dark clothes so nearly alike that they were surely uniforms. There was thin white piping up and over the shoulders and down the sides of the tubular trouser legs. Each had, on the right side of his chest, a rather dI'm Spaceship-and-Sun, the symbol of the Galactic Empire on every inhabited world of the Galaxy, with, in this case, a dark "D" in the center of the sun.</p><p>这两个人都有一头鬈曲的黑发，以及达尔人必备的粗黑八字胡。两人皆很瘦小，皆穿着一套深色服装。那两件衣服极其相似，想当然是一种制服，上面绣着细白的滚边，上至肩头，下至管状裤腿的外侧。他们的右胸处挂着一个不甚明显的“星舰与太阳”徽章，在银河系每一个住人世界上，它所代表的都是银河帝国。只不过眼前这个徽章，太阳中央还有一个深色的“达”字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon realized immediately that these were two members of the Dahlite security forces.</p><p>谢顿立刻了解，这两个人是达尔维安警察的成员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whats all this?" said Seldon sternly.</p><p>“这是怎么回事？”谢顿以严厉的口气说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One of the men stepped forward. "I am Sector Officer Lanel Russ. This is my partner, Gebore Astinwald."</p><p>其中一人向前走来。“我是本区巡官拉涅尔·鲁斯。这是我的搭档，葛柏·艾斯汀伍德。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Both presented glittering identification holo-tabs. Seldon didn't bother looking at them. "What it is you want?"</p><p>两人都出示了亮晶晶的全息标签识别证。谢顿根本懒得看，只是问道：“你们想干什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ said calmly, "Are you Hari Seldon of Helicon?"</p><p>鲁斯以平静的口气说：“你是来自赫利肯的哈里·谢顿吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am."</p><p>“是的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And are you Dors Venabili of Cinna, Mistress?"</p><p>“而你是来自锡纳的铎丝·凡纳比里吗，夫人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am," said Dors.</p><p>“是的。”铎丝答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm here to investigate a complaint that one Hari Seldon instigated a riot yesterday."</p><p>“我来这里是要调查一件投诉，昨天有个哈里·谢顿煽起一桩暴动。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I did no such thing," said Seldon.</p><p>“我没做那种事。”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Our information is," said Russ, looking at the screen of a small computer pad, "that you accused a newsman of being an Imperial agent, thus instigating a riot against him."</p><p>“我们的情报指出，”鲁斯看了看一个小型电脑板的屏幕，“你指控一名记者是帝国特务，因此煽起一场暴动对付他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "It was I who said he was an Imperial agent, Officer. I had reason to think he was. It is surely no crime to express ones opinion. The Empire has freedom of speech."</p><p>铎丝道：“说他是帝国特务的人是我，警官，我有理由这样想。表达一个人的意见当然没有罪，帝国是有言论自由的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That does not cover an opinion deliberately advanced in order to instigate a riot."</p><p>“并不包括为了煽起一场暴动，而蓄意提出的意见。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can you say it was, Officer?"</p><p>“警官，你怎能这样说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At this point, Mistress Tisalver interposed in a shrill voice, "I can say it, Officer. She saw there was a crowd present, a crowd of gutter people who were just looking for trouble. She deliberately said he was an Imperial agent when she knew nothing of the sort and she shouted it to the crowd to stir them up. It was plain that she knew what she was doing."</p><p>这时，堤沙佛夫人以尖锐的声音插嘴道：“警官，我能这样说。当时她看到外面有一群人，一群从贫民区来的人，他们只是想找麻烦。她故意说他是帝国特务，其实她根本毫无概念，但她就这样对群众喊话，把他们煽动起来。事实很明显，她知道自己在做什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Casilia," said her husband pleadingly, but she cast one look at him and he said no more.</p><p>“凯西莉娅。”她的丈夫以恳求的语气呼唤她，但挨了一个白眼之后，他就什么也不说了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ turned to Mistress Tisalver. "Did you lodge the complaint, Mistress?"</p><p>鲁斯转向堤沙佛夫人。“夫人，是你投诉的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. These two have been living here for a few days and theyve done nothing but make trouble. Theyve invited people of low reputation into my apartment, damaging my standing with my neighbors."</p><p>“是的。这两个人在这里住了好几天，除了惹麻烦什么也不干。他们邀请低级民众进我的公寓，破坏我在邻居心目中的地位。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is it against the law, Officer," asked Seldon, "to invite clean, quiet citizens of Dahl into ones room? The two rooms upstairs are our rooms. We have rented them and they are paid for. Is it a crime to speak to Dahlites in Dahl, Officer?"</p><p>“邀请清洁而平和的达尔公民进某人的房间，”谢顿问道，“警官，难道是违法的行为吗？楼上两个房间是我们的，我们已经租下，并且付了房租。警官，在达尔境内和达尔人交谈也犯法吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, it is not," said Russ. "That is not part of the complaint. What gave you reason, Mistress Venabili, to suppose the person you so accused was, in fact, an Imperial agent?"</p><p>“不，不犯法。”鲁斯说，“那并非投诉的一部分。你究竟有什么理由，凡纳比里夫人，认为你指控的那个人确实是帝国特务？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "He had a small brown mustache, from which I concluded he was not a Dahlite. I surmised he was an Imperial agent."</p><p>铎丝说：“他只有两小撇棕色胡须，我据此断定他不是达尔人。我进而推测，他是一名帝国特务。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You surmised? Your associate, Master Seldon, has no mustache at all. Do you surmise he is an Imperial agent?"</p><p>“你推测？你的同伴，谢顿老爷，他根本没有胡子。你也推测他是一名帝国特务吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In any case," said Seldon hastily, "there was no riot. We asked the crowd to take no action against the supposed newsman and I'm sure they didnt."</p><p>“无论如何，”谢顿急忙道，“根本没有暴动。我们要求群众别对那个所谓的记者采取任何行动，我确定他们听进去了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Youre sure, Master Seldon?" said Russ. "Our information is that you left immediately after making your accusation. How could you witness what happened after you left?"</p><p>“你确定，谢顿老爷？”鲁斯说，“根据我们的情报，你们做出指控后立刻离去。而你离去后，又怎能见证发生了什么事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I couldnt," said Seldon, "but let me ask you……Is the man dead? Is the man hurt?"</p><p>“我不能，”谢顿说，“可是让我问你……那人死了吗？那人受伤了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The man has been interviewed. He denies he is an Imperial agent and we have no information that he is. He also claims he was handled roughly."</p><p>“那人曾接受约谈。他否认自己是帝国特务，我们也没有情报显示这点。他还声称曾遭到虐待。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He may well be lying in both respects," said Seldon. "I would suggest a Psychic Probe."</p><p>“他很可能这两件事都撒了谎。”谢顿说，“我建议使用心灵探测器。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That cannot be done on the victI'm of a crime," said Russ. "The sector government is very firm on that. It might do if you two, as the criminals in this case, each underwent a Psychic Probe. Would you like us to do that?"</p><p>“不能对受害者那样做，”鲁斯说，“区政府对这点非常坚持。倒是有可能让你们两人……这件案子中的罪犯……接受一次心灵探测。你们希望我们那样做吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon and Dors exchanged glances for a moment, then Seldon said, "No, of course not."</p><p>谢顿与铎丝交换了一下眼色，然后谢顿说：“不，当然不要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Of course not, repeated Russ with just a tinge of sarcasm in his voice, "but youre ready enough to suggest it for someone else." </p><p>“当然不要，”鲁斯重复道，声音中仅有些许嘲讽之意，“但你却毫不犹豫地建议对别人这样做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other officer, Astinwald, who had so far not said a word, smiled at this. </p><p>另外一位警官（艾斯汀伍德）目前为止尚未说半句话，此时则露出微笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ said, "We also have information that two days ago you engaged in a knife fight in Billibotton and badly hurt a Dahlite citizen named"……he struck a button on his computer pad and studied the new page on the screen……"Elgin Marron."</p><p>鲁斯又说：“我们还有情报显示，昨天你们曾在脐眼进行一场械斗，而且重伤一名达尔公民，名叫……”他按下电脑板的一个按键，看了看屏幕上的新画面。“厄金·玛隆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "Does your information tell you how the fight started?"</p><p>铎丝问：“你的情报有没有告诉你械斗的起因？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That is irrelevant at the moment, Mistress. Do you deny that the fight took place?"</p><p>“夫人，那和目前的讨论无关。你否认发生过那场械斗吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course we don't deny the fight took place," said Seldon hotly, "but we deny that we in any way instigated that. We were attacked. Mistress Venabili was seized by this Marron and it was clear he was attempting to rape her. What happened afterward was pure self-defense. Or does Dahl condone rape?"</p><p>“我们当然不否认发生过械斗，”谢顿激动地说，“但我们坚决否认是我们挑起来的。当时我们遭到攻击！那个玛隆抓住了凡纳比里夫人，而且显然企图性侵她。接下来发生的事，只是单纯的自卫行动。难道达尔纵容强奸吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ said with very little intonation in his voice, "You say you were attacked? By how many?"</p><p>鲁斯以近乎平板的声音说：“你说你们遭到攻击？被多少人攻击？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ten men."</p><p>“十名男子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you alone……with a woman……defended yourself against ten men?"</p><p>“而你只有一个人，再加上一个女的，对抗这十名男子？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mistress Venabili and I defended ourselves. Yes."</p><p>“是的，只有我和凡纳比里夫人两人御敌。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How is it, then, that neither of you shows any damage whatever? Are either of you cut or bruised where it doesnt show right now?"</p><p>“那么，你们两人怎么没有显露任何伤痕？你们有没有谁被割伤或打伤，只是受伤的部位现在看不到？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, Officer."</p><p>“没有，警官。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How is it, then, that in the fight of one……plus a woman……against ten, you are in no way hurt, but that the complainant, Elgin Marron, has been hospitalized with wounds and Will require a skin transplant on his upper lip?"</p><p>“那么，在一个人……再加一个女的……对付十人的格斗中，你们怎么会毫发无损？而那个原告，厄金·玛隆，却伤痕累累地躺在医院，而且上唇需要接受皮肤移植？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We fought well," said Seldon grimly.</p><p>“我们身手很好。”谢顿绷着脸说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Unbelievably well. What would you say if I told you that three men have testified that you and your friend attacked Marron, unprovoked?"</p><p>“好得难以置信。假如我告诉你已经有三个人作证，说你和你的朋友在毫无挑衅的情况下攻击玛隆，你会怎么说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I would say that it belies belief that we should. I'm sure that Marron has a record as a brawler and knifeman. I tell you that there were ten there. Obviously, six refused to swear to a lie. Do the other three explain why they did not come to the help of their friend if they witnessed him under unprovoked attack and in danger of his life? It must be clear to you that they are lying."</p><p>“我会说没有人相信我们会那样做。我确定那个玛隆有案可查，是个滋事分子和带刀的凶徒。我告诉你当时共有十个人，显然，其中有六个拒绝为谎言宣誓作证。请问其他三人有没有做出解释，为何他们未曾出手帮助他们的朋友……倘若他们果真目睹他遭到毫无来由的攻击，而且性命受到威胁？你一定很清楚他们是在说谎。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you suggest a Psychic Probe for them?"</p><p>“你建议对他们施用心灵探测器吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. And before you ask, I still refuse to consider one for us."</p><p>“是的。而且你不用再问了，我仍然拒绝用在我们身上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ said, "We have also received information that yesterday, after leaving the scene of the riot, you consulted with one Davan, a known subversive who is wanted by the security police. Is that true?"</p><p>鲁斯说：“此外我们还接到情报，说你们昨天离开暴动现场后，曾经去会晤一个名叫达凡的人，一个公认的、被维安警察通缉在案的颠覆分子。这是真的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Youll have to prove that without help from us," said Seldon. "Were not answering any further questions."</p><p>“这点你得自己证明，我们不会帮你的忙。”谢顿说，“我们不准备再回答任何问题。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ put away his pad. "I'm afraid I must ask you to come with us to headquarters for further interrogation."</p><p>鲁斯将电脑板收起来。“恐怕我必须请两位跟我们回总部，去接受进一步的侦讯。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't think thats necessary, Officer," said Seldon. "We are Outworlders who have done nothing criminal. We have tried to avoid a newsman who was annoying us unduly, we tried to protect ourselves against rape and possible murder in a part of the sector known for criminal behavior, and weve spoken to various Dahlites. We see nothing there to warrant our further questioning. It would come under the heading of harassment."</p><p>“我认为没这个必要，警官。”谢顿说，“我们是外星人士，况且并未做出任何犯罪行为。我们曾经试图回避一名记者，因为他过分骚扰我们。而在本区中以犯罪闻名的地带，我们曾经试图保护自己，避免遭到性侵和可能的杀害。此外，就是我们和许多达尔人谈过话。我看不出有任何理由该对我们做进一步的盘问，这样做等于是一种骚扰。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We make these decisions," said Russ. "Not you. Will you please come with us?"</p><p>“作决定的是我们，”鲁斯说，“不是你。请两位跟我们走好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, we Will not," said Dors.</p><p>“不，我们不去。”铎丝说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Watch out!" cried out Mistress Tisalver. "Shes got two knives."</p><p>“小心！”堤沙佛夫人叫道，“她有两把刀子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Officer Russ sighed and said, "Thank you, Mistress, but I know she does." He turned to Dors. "Do you know its a serious crime to carry a knife without a permit in this sector? Do you have a permit?"</p><p>鲁斯警官叹了一声。“谢谢你，夫人，不过我早就知道了。”他又转向铎丝，“你可知道在本区，未经许可携带刀械是一项重罪？你有许可证吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, Officer, I dont."</p><p>“我没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was clearly with an illegal knife, then, that you assaulted Marron? Do you realize that that greatly increases the seriousness of the crime?"</p><p>“那么，你用来攻击玛隆的武器，显然是一把非法刀械？你可了解这是严重的罪上加罪？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was no crime, Officer," said Dors. "Understand that. Marron had a knife as well and no permit, I am certain."</p><p>“警官，这不算什么罪。”铎丝说，“请你了解一件事，玛隆也有一把刀，而且我确定他也没许可证。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We have no evidence to that effect and while Marron has knife wounds, neither of you have any."</p><p>“这点我们并无证据，不过玛隆身上有刀伤，你们两人却谁也没有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course he had a knife, Officer. If you don't know that every man in Billibotton and most men elsewhere in Dahl carry knives for which they probably don't have permits, then youre the only man in Dahl who doesnt know. There are shops here wherever you turn that sell knives openly. don't you know that?"</p><p>“警官，他当然有一把刀。假使你不知道脐眼每一个人，以及达尔区大部分的人都随身带刀，而且或许都没有许可证，那你就是唯一不知情的达尔人。在此地不论你转到哪里，都能找到公然贩刀的商店。这点你不知道吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ said, "It doesnt matter what I know or don't know in this respect. Nor does it matter whether other people are breaking the law or how many of them do. All that matters at this moment is that Mistress Venabili is breaking the anti-knife law. I must ask you to give up those knives to me right now, Mistress, and the two of you must then accompany me to headquarters."</p><p>鲁斯说：“我对这方面知道得多或少并不重要，其他人是否违法或有多少人违法也不重要。此时此刻，重要的是凡纳比里夫人触犯了《反刀械法》。夫人，我必须请你立刻将那两把刀交给我，然后你们两人必须随我到总部去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "In that case, take my knives away from me."</p><p>铎丝说：“既然这样，把我的刀子取走啊。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ sighed. "You must not think, Mistress, that knives are all the weapons there are in Dahl or that I need engage you in a knife fight. Both my partner and I have blasters that Will destroy you in a moment, before you can drop your hands to your knife hilt……however fast you are. We wont use a blaster, of course, because we are not here to kill you. However, each of us also has a neuronic whip, which we can use on you freely. I hope you wont ask for a demonstration. It wont kill you, do you permanent harm of any kind, or leave any marks……but the pain is excruciating. My partner is holding a neuronic whip on you right now. And here is mine……Now, let us have your knives, Mistress Venabili."</p><p>鲁斯又叹了一声。“夫人，你该不会认为刀械是我们达尔唯一的武器，或是我需要和你进行一场刀战吧。我和我的搭档都有手铳，可以在瞬间将你摧毁，远在你的双手能碰到刀柄之前……不论你有多快。当然，我们不至于使用手铳，因为我们不是来杀你的。然而，我们每个人还有一柄神经鞭，可以随意用来对付你。我希望你不会要求一次示范。它不会要你的命或是造成任何永久性伤害，甚至不会留下任何伤痕……但那种痛苦却是难以忍受的。现在我的搭档正举着神经鞭对着你，而这把则是我的……好啦，凡纳比里夫人，把你的刀交给我们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was a moments pause and then Seldon said, "Its no use, Dors. Give him your knives."</p><p>顿了一下之后，谢顿说：“没有用的，铎丝，把刀子给他吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And at that moment, a frantic pounding sounded at the door and they all heard a voice raised in high-pitched expostulation.</p><p>就在这个时候，大门响起一阵狂暴的敲击声，大家也都听到一个拉高音调的吼叫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych had not entirely left the neighborhood after he had walked them back to their apartment house.</p><p>芮奇带他们回到公寓后，并未真正离开这个社区。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had eaten well while waiting for the interview with Davan to be done and later had slept a bit after finding a bathroom that more or less worked. He really had no place to go now that all that was done. He had a home of sorts and a mother who was not likely to be perturbed if he stayed away for a while. She never was.</p><p>在达凡住处外等待的时候，他曾经饱餐了一顿。后来，在找到一间勉强还能使用的厕所后，他又小睡了一会儿。现在这些事都已经做完了，他实在没什么地方可去。他也算有个家，但他即使好一阵子不回去，他的母亲也不大可能担心……她从未担心过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did not know who his father was and wondered sometimes if he really had one. He had been told he had to have one and the reasons for that had been explained to him crudely enough. Sometimes he wondered if he ought to believe so peculiar a story, but he did find the details titillating. </p><p>他不知道生父是谁，有时甚至怀疑自己是否真有父亲。不过有人曾经告诉他，说他的父亲一定存在，并以很露骨的方式将理由解释给他听。他有时也会怀疑是否该相信这么奇特的故事，但他的确发觉那些细节令人心痒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He thought of that in connection with the lady. She was an old lady, of course, but she was pretty and she could fight like a man……better than a man. It filled him with vague notions.</p><p>他将那件事和那位大姐联想到一块。她当然是个年纪不小的大姐，可是她相当漂亮，而且能像男人一样打斗……甚至比男人更厉害。这使他心中充斥着一些模糊的想法。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And she had offered to let him take a bath. He could swI'm in the Billibotton pool sometimes when he had some credits he didn't need for anything else or when he could sneak in. Those were the only times he got wet all over, but it was chilly and he had to wait to get dry.</p><p>而且，她曾提出要让他洗个澡。他偶尔也能在脐眼的游泳池泡一泡，那是当他有些没处花的信用点，或是能偷溜进去的时候。游泳是他唯一全身浸湿的机会，但总是相当寒冷，而且事后还得把身子晾干。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Taking a bath was different. There would be hot water, soap, towels, and warm air. He wasn't sure what it would feel like, except that it would be nice if she was there.</p><p>洗澡则是完全不同的一回事，会有热水、肥皂、毛巾与热气流。他不确定那会是什么样的感觉，只晓得她若在场必将十分美好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was walkway-wise enough to know of places where he could park himself in an alley off a walkway that would be near a bathroom and still be near enough to where she was, yet where he probably wouldnt be found and made to run away. </p><p>他对这一带的人行道足够熟悉，晓得人行道旁巷道内的哪些地方可容他藏身，不但离一间厕所不远，又能和她的距离仍然够近，而且或许不会被人发现，不至于落荒而逃。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He spent the night thinking strange thoughts. What if he did learn to read and write? Could he do something with that? He wasn't sure what, but maybe they could tell him. He had vague ideas of being paid money to do things he didn't know how to do now, but he didn't know what those things might be. He would have to be told, but how do you get told?</p><p>他整夜都在想一些奇怪的念头。他若是真的学会读书写字，那会怎么样？他能用这本事做什么事吗？他不确定能做什么，但她或许能告诉他。他有些模糊的概念，知道做些现在还不会做的事可以赚到工资，却不晓得那会是些什么样的事。得有人告诉他才行，但要怎样才能找到这样的人？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If he stayed with the man and the lady, they might help. But why should they want him to stay with them?</p><p>假如他留在那个男人和那位大姐身边，他们或许会帮助他。可是，他们怎么会要他留在身边呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He drowsed off, coming to later, not because the light was brightening, but because his sharp ears caught the heightening and deepening of sounds from the walkway as the activities of the day began.</p><p>他打起瞌睡，不久又清醒过来，并非由于光线变得明亮，而是他敏锐的听力察觉到来自人行道的声音越来越嘈杂，标志着一天的活动已经开始。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had learned to identify almost every variety of sound, because in the underground maze of Billibotton, if you wanted to survive with even a minimum of comfort, you had to be aware of things before you saw them. And there was something about the sound of a ground-car motor that he now heard that signaled danger to him. It had an official sound, a hostile sound……</p><p>他早已学会分辨几乎每一种声音，因为在脐眼那种地底迷宫中，即使只是想要苟活，也必须在看到任何事物之前便先行察觉。他现在听到的是地面车发动机的声音，而他听出了其中的危险讯息。它具有一种官方的声音，一种敌意的声音……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He shook himself awake and stole quietly toward the walkway. He scarcely needed to see the Spaceship-and-Sun on the ground-car. Its lines were enough. He knew they had to be coming for the man and the lady because they had seen Davan. He did not pause to question his thoughts or to analyze them. He was off on a run, beating his way through the gathering life of the day. </p><p>他甩了甩头，让自己清醒过来，再悄悄向人行道走去。他几乎不需要看到那辆地面车的“星舰与太阳”徽章，光看车子的外型就足够了。他知道，他们必定是来抓那一男一女的，因为他俩见到了达凡。他并未停下来质疑自己的想法或加以分析，而是立刻拔腿飞奔，在逐渐拥挤的人群中冲出一条路。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was back in less than fifteen minutes. The ground-car was still there and there were curious and cautious onlookers gazing at it from all sides and from a respectful distance. There would soon be more. He pounded his way up the stairs, trying to remember which door he should bang on. No time for the elevator. </p><p>他在十五分钟内又回来了。那辆地面车还在那里，许多好奇而谨慎的民众从四面八方望过来，但都维持着一段不短的距离。想必旁观者很快会越来越多。他一面“砰砰砰”地爬着楼梯，一面努力回想该捶哪家的门。他根本来不及搭升降机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He found the door……at least he thought he did……and he banged, shouting in a squeak, "Lady! Lady!"</p><p>他终于找到那扇门，至少他认为没错。他开始使劲捶门，同时以尖锐的声音喊道：“大姐！大姐！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was too excited to remember her name, but he remembered part of the mans. "Hari!" he shouted. "Let me in."</p><p>由于过度激动，他竟然忘了她的姓名，不过他还记得那男子的名字。“哈里！”他吼道，“让我进去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The door opened and he rushed in……tried to rush in. The rough hand of an officer seized his arm. "Hold it, kid. Where do you think youre going?"</p><p>房门打开后，他立刻冲进去……应该说是试图冲进去。一名警官的粗大手掌抓住了他的手臂。“慢着，小子，你以为这是哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Leggo! I aint done nothin." He looked about. "Hey, lady, whatre they doin?"</p><p>“撒手！我啥也没做。”他四下望了望，“嘿，大姐，他们在干啥？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Arresting us," said Dors grimly.</p><p>“逮捕我们。”铎丝绷着脸说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What for?" said Raych, panting and struggling. "Hey, leggo, you Sunbadger. don't go with him, lady. You don't have to go with him."</p><p>“为什么？”芮奇一面喘气一面挣扎，“嘿，撒手，你这个徽子。别跟他走，大姐，你不必跟他走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You get out," said Russ, shaking the boy vehemently.</p><p>“你滚开。”鲁斯一面说，一面猛力摇晃这个男孩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I aint, You aint either, Sunbadger. My whole gang is coming. You aint gettin out, lessn you let these guys go."</p><p>“不，我不。徽子，你也别走。我们整帮人就要来啦，你逃不掉的，除非你让这两个哥儿们走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What whole gang?" said Russ, frowning.</p><p>“什么整帮人？”鲁斯皱着眉头说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Theyre right outside now. Probly takin your ground-car apart. And theyll take yore apart."</p><p>“现在他们就在外面，说不定正在拆你的地面车，他们还会把你也拆了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ turned toward his partner, "Call headquarters. Have them send out a couple of trucks with Macros."</p><p>鲁斯转头对他的搭档说：“联络总部，要他们派几辆载满重武的卡车来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No!" shrieked Raych, breaking loose and rushing at Astinwald. "Dont call!"</p><p>“不！”芮奇尖叫道。他挣脱了那只手，朝艾斯汀伍德冲过去。“别联络！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ leveled his neuronic whip and fired.</p><p>鲁斯举起神经鞭瞄准，然后发射。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych shrieked, grasped at his right shoulder, and fell down, wriggling madly. </p><p>芮奇惨叫一声，伸手抓住自己的右肩，随即跌倒在地，发狂般不停抽搐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Russ had not yet turned back to Seldon, when the latter, seizing him by the wrist, pushed the neuronic whip up in the air and then around and behind, while stamping on his foot to keep him relatively motionless. Hari could feel the shoulder dislocate, even while Russ emitted a hoarse, agonized yell.</p><p>鲁斯还来不及转身，谢顿已从后面抓住他的手腕，将神经鞭推到半空中，再将他的手扭到身后，同时踏住他一只脚掌，令他几乎动弹不得。在鲁斯发出嘶哑而痛苦的叫喊时，谢顿已能感到他的肩膀脱臼了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> Astinwald raised his blaster quickly, but Dorss left arm was around his shoulder and the knife in her right hand was at his throat.</p><p>艾斯汀伍德迅速举起手铳，但铎丝的左臂立刻勾住他的肩膀，右手的刀子则架在他的喉头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Dont move!" she said. "Move a millimeter, any part of you, and I cut you through your neck to the spine……drop the blaster. drop it! And the neuronic whip."</p><p>“别动！”她说，“不论你全身任何部位，只要蠢动一毫米，我就从你的颈子一直切到脊柱。把手铳丢掉，丢掉！还有神经鞭。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon picked up Raych, still moaning, and held him tightly. He turned to Tisalver and said, "There are people out there. Angry people. I'll have them in here and theyll break up everything youve got. Theyll smash the walls. If you don't want that to happen, pick up those weapons and throw them into the next room. Take the weapons from the security officer on the door and do the same. Quickly! Get your wife to help. Shell think twice next time before sending in complaints against innocent people……Dors, this one on the floor wont do anything for a while. Put the other one out of action, but don't kill him."</p><p>谢顿抱起仍在呻吟的芮奇，将他紧紧搂在怀里，然后转向堤沙佛说：“外面有大批群众，愤怒的群众。我让他们进来的话，他们会打烂你所有的一切，还会打碎每一面墙壁。如果你不想发生这种事，就捡起这些武器，丢到隔壁房间。再从瘫在地上的维安警官身上取走武器，同样丢到隔壁去。快！叫你太太帮忙。下次再想控告无辜民众，她会三思而后行。铎丝，这个倒在地板上的暂时不能做什么。让另一个也失去行动能力，但是别杀他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Right," said Dors. Reversing her knife, she struck him hard on the skull with the haft. He went to his knees.</p><p>“好的。”铎丝答道。她倒转刀身，用刀柄在那人头盖骨上重击一记。他立刻屈膝倒地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She made a face. "I hate doing that."</p><p>她做了个鬼脸。“我痛恨这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They fired at Raych," said Seldon, trying to mask his own sick feeling at what had happened.</p><p>“是他们先射击芮奇。”谢顿这么说，以掩饰自己对这一切的厌恶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They left the apartment hurriedly and, once out on the walkway, found it choked with people, almost all men, who raised a shout when they saw them emerge. They pushed in close and the smell of poorly washed humanity was overpowering. </p><p>他们匆匆离开那栋公寓，来到了人行道，发觉外面人山人海，而且几乎都是男性。看到他们出现之后，众人发出一声欢呼。他们纷纷凑近，一股从未好好洗澡的强烈气味扑鼻而来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Someone shouted, "Where are the Sunbadgers?"</p><p>有人喊道：“那些徽子在哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Inside," called out Dors piercingly. "Leave them alone. Theyll be helpless for a while, but theyll get reinforcements, so get out of here fast."</p><p>“在里面。”铎丝以刺耳的声音叫道，“别管他们。他们会有一阵子无能为力，不过他们即将得到增援，所以尽快离开这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What about you?" came from a dozen throats.</p><p>“你们怎么办？”十来个人异口同声问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Were getting out too. We wont be back."</p><p>“我们也要走，不会再回来了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'll take care of them," shrilled Raych, struggling out of Seldons arms and standing on his feet. He was rubbing his right shoulder madly. "I can walk. Lemme past."</p><p>“我会照顾他们。”芮奇尖声道，说完便挣脱谢顿的臂膀，自己站了起来。他一面拼命搓揉右肩，一面说：“我可以走，让我过去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The crowd opened for him and he said, "Mister, lady, come with me. Fast!" </p><p>群众为他让出一条路，他便说：“大哥，大姐，跟我来。快！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were accompanied down the walkway by several dozen men and then Raych suddenly gestured at an opening and muttered, "In here, folks. I'll rake ya to a place no one Will ever find ya. Even Davan probly don't know it. Only thing is, we got to go through the sewer levels. No one Will see us there, but its sort of stinky……know what I mean?"</p><p>几十名男子陪同他们沿着人行道前进。不久之后，芮奇突然指了指一个开口处，喃喃道：“伙伴们，这里。我要带你们到一个谁也找不到的地方，就连达凡搞不好也不知道。只是有一件事，我们得通过污水层。那里不会有人发现我们，但是有那么一点臭……明白我的意思吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I imagine well survive," muttered Seldon.</p><p>“我想我们死不了。”谢顿喃喃答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And down they went along a narrow spiraling ramp and up rose the mephitic odors to greet them.</p><p>于是他们沿着狭窄的螺旋坡道向下走，迎接他们的恶臭则逐渐向上袭来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych found them a hiding place. It had meant climbing up the metal rungs of a ladder and it had led them to a large loftlike room, the use of which Seldon could not imagine. It was filled with equipment, bulky and silent, the function of which also remained a mystery. The room was reasonably clean and free of dust and a steady draft of air wafted through that prevented the dust from settling and……more important seemed to lessen the odor.</p><p>芮奇为他们找到一个藏身之处。他们攀着一架金属梯爬了许多级，才来到这个类似阁楼的大房间，谢顿无从想象它的功用是什么。室内被一具体积庞大、安静无声的设备所占据，它的功能同样是个谜。这个房间相当清洁，几乎一尘不染。通风口送出一股稳定的气流，不但阻止了灰尘的堆积，更重要的是，似乎也减轻了那股恶臭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych seemed pleased. "Aint this nice?" he demanded. He still rubbed his shoulder now and then and winced when he rubbed too hard.</p><p>芮奇似乎很高兴。“这里好不好？”他追问道。他还在不时搓揉他的肩头，每当揉得太用力时就会缩一下脖子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It could be worse," said Seldon. "Do you know what this place is used for, Raych?"</p><p>“比我想象中的好。”谢顿说，“芮奇，你知道这地方是做什么用的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych shrugged or began to do so and winced. "I dunno," he said. Then he added with a touch of swagger, "Who cares?"</p><p>芮奇耸了耸肩，或说还没这么做便痛得缩了回去。“我不知。”说完，他又带点倨傲地补充道，“谁管它？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors, who had sat down on the floor after brushing it with her hand and then looking suspiciously at her palm, said, "If you want a guess, I think this is part of a complex that is involved in the detoxification and recycling of wastes. The stuff must surely end up as fertilizer."</p><p>铎丝刚才用手抹了抹地板，再以怀疑的眼光看了看自己的手掌，然后才坐下来。此时她说：“如果你要我猜，我想这个建筑群是用来进行排泄物的去毒和回收。那些东西最后当然是变成肥料。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then," said Seldon gloomily, "those who run the complex Will be down here periodically and may come at any moment, for all we know."</p><p>“那么，”谢顿以沮丧的口吻说，“根据我的研判，管理这个建筑群的人会定期下来这里，而且随时可能下来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I been here before," said Raych. "I never saw no one here."</p><p>“我以前在这儿待过，”芮奇说，“我从来没在这儿见过人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I suppose Trantor is heavily automated wherever possible and if anything calls for automation it would be this treatment of wastes," said Dors. "We may be safe……for a while."</p><p>“我想川陀各处都已经尽可能高度自动化，而要说有什么最需要自动化的东西，当然首推排泄物处理。”铎丝说，“我们应该……暂时安全无虞。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not for long. Well get hungry and thirsty, Dors."</p><p>“不会太久的，铎丝，我们会饿会渴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can get food and water for us," said Raych. "Ya got to know how to make out if youre an alley kid."</p><p>“我能帮大家找来食物和饮水。”芮奇说，“如果你是个野孩子，你就得知道该怎么凑合。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you, Raych," said Seldon absently, "but right now I'm not hungry." He sniffed. "I may never be hungry again."</p><p>“谢谢你，芮奇，”谢顿心不在焉地说，“可是现在我并不饿。”他闻了闻周遭的气味，“我也许再也不会感到饥饿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You Will be," said Dors, "and even if you lose your appetite for a while, youll get thirsty. At least elimination is no problem. Were practically living over what is clearly an open sewer."</p><p>“你会的。”铎丝说，“而且即使你暂时失去胃口，你也会感到口渴。至少排泄不成问题，我们等于住在一个开放的下水道上。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was silence for a while. The light was dI'm and Seldon wondered why the Trantorians didn't keep it dark altogether. But then it occurred to him that he had never encountered true darkness in any public area. It was probably a habit in an energy-rich society. Strange that a world of forty billion should be energy-rich, but with the internal heat of the planet to draw upon, to say nothing of solar energy and nuclear fusion plants in space, it was. In fact, come to think of it, there was no energy-poor planet in the Empire. Was there a time when technology had been so primitive that energy poverty was possible? </p><p>接着是一阵沉默。此地光线黯淡，谢顿不禁纳闷川陀人为何不让它保持完全黑暗。但他随即想到，不论在任何公共场所，他从未遇到真正的黑暗，这或许是能源充足社会的一种习惯。说来也奇怪，一个拥有四百亿人口的世界竟然能源充足。不过，既然有行星内部的热量可供汲取，再加上太阳能以及太空中的核融合电厂，这也就不足为奇。其实再仔细想一想，帝国境内根本没有能源短缺的行星。过去是否曾有一段科技十分原始、能源确有可能匮乏的时期呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He leaned against a system of pipes through which……for all he knew……sewage ran. He drew away from the pipes as the thought occurred to him and he sat down next to Dors.</p><p>他倚在一组输送管上，据他所知，里面流动的应该是污水。一想到这点，他赶紧离开那组管子，坐到了铎丝身旁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "Is there any way we can get in touch with Chetter Hummin?"</p><p>他说：“我们有没有办法和契特·夫铭取得联络？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "As a matter of fact, I did send a message, though I hated to."</p><p>铎丝说：“事实上，我已经送出一道讯息，虽然我痛恨这样做。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You hated to?"</p><p>“你痛恨这样做？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My orders are to protect you. Each time I have to get in touch with him, it means Ive failed."</p><p>“我的使命是保护你。每次我不得不和他联络时，就代表我又失败了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon regarded her out of narrowed eyes. "Do you have to be so compulsive, Dors? You cant protect me against the security officers of an entire sector."</p><p>谢顿眯起眼睛凝视她。“你一定要这么强迫自己吗，铎丝？面对整区的维安警力，你根本无法保护我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I suppose not. We can disable a few……"</p><p>“我也这么想。我们能打垮几个……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know. We did. But theyll send out reinforcements……armored ground-cars……neuronic cannon……sleeping mist. I'm not sure what they have, but theyre going to throw in their entire armory. I'm sure of it."</p><p>“我知道，我们也做到了。但他们会派出增援部队……装甲地面车……神经炮……催眠雾。我不确定他们有些什么，可是我敢确定，他们会投入所有的军火。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Youre probably right," said Dors, her mouth tightening.</p><p>“你或许是对的。”铎丝紧紧抿着嘴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They wont find ya, lady," said Raych suddenly. His sharp eyes had moved from one to the other as they talked. "They never find Davan."</p><p>“大姐，他们抓不到你。”芮奇突然说。刚才他们交谈的时候，他以锐利的目光轮流扫视他们两人。“他们从没抓到达凡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors smiled without joy and ruffled the boys hair, then looked at the palm of her hand with a little dismay. She said, "I'm not sure if you ought to stay with us, Raych. I don't want them finding you."</p><p>铎丝勉强笑了笑，并伸手抓抓男孩的头发，然后有点后悔地望着自己的手掌。“芮奇，我不确定你应不应该跟我们待在一起。我不想让他们抓到你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They wont find me and if I leave ya, wholl get ya food and water and wholl find ya new hidin places, so the Sunbadgersll never know where to look?"</p><p>“他们抓不到我。而且我要是走了，谁来帮你们找食物和饮水，谁又来帮你们找新的藏身处，好让徽子永远不知上哪儿去抓？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, Raych, theyll find us. They don't really look too hard for Davan. He annoys them, but I suspect they don't take him seriously. Do you know what I mean?"</p><p>“不，芮奇，他们会找到我们。他们并没有真正尽力寻找达凡。他为他们带来困扰，但我猜想他们并未将他看得多严重。你明白我的意思吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You mean hes just a pain in the……the neck and they figure he aint worth chasing all over the lot."</p><p>“你的意思是说，他只是……脖子上一点小伤。根据他们的估量，不值得翻遍整个地区追捕他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, thats what I mean. But you see, we hurt two of the officers very badly and theyre not going to let us get away with that. If it takes their whole force……if they have to sweep through every hidden or unused corridor in the sector……theyll get us."</p><p>“是的，我正是那个意思。可是你看，我们把两名警官打成重伤，他们不会让我们就这样逍遥法外。假如他们动用全部的警力……假如他们扫荡本区每个隐匿或无用的回廊……他们就会抓到我们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "That makes me feel like……like [natinn]. If I didn't run in there and get zapped, ya wouldnt have taken out them officers and ya wouldnt be in such trouble."</p><p>芮奇说：“那令我觉得好像……好像我一无是处。假使我没跑到那里去，而且挨了一记，你们就不会撂倒他们两个警官，就不会有这样的麻烦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, sooner or later, wed have……uh……taken them out. Who knows? We may have to take out a few more."</p><p>“不，迟早我们还是会……喔……撂倒他们。谁知道呢？我们也许还得再撂倒些。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, ya did it beautiful," said Raych. "If I hadn't been aching all over, I couldve watched more and enjoyed it."</p><p>“嗯，你的动作漂亮极了。”芮奇说，“要不是全身疼痛，我就能看到更多细节，好好欣赏一番。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "It wouldnt do us any good to try to fight the entire security system. The question is: What Will they do to us once they have us? A prison sentence, surely."</p><p>谢顿说：“试图对抗整个维安系统，对我们没有任何好处。现在问题是：一旦抓到我们，他们会把我们怎么样？不用说，当然是判处监禁。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh no. If necessary, well have to appeal to the Emperor," put in Dors.</p><p>“喔，不。若有必要，我们不得不向大帝提出上诉。”铎丝插嘴道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The Emperor?" said Raych, wide-eyed. "You know the Emperor?"</p><p>“大帝？”芮奇张大眼睛说，“你们认识大帝？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon waved at the boy. "Any Galactic citizen can appeal to the Emperor……That strikes me as the wrong thing to do, Dors. Ever since Hummin and I left the Imperial Sector, weve been evading the Emperor."</p><p>谢顿对男孩挥挥手。“银河帝国任何公民都能向皇帝上诉……铎丝，我觉得这会是个错误的举动。自从我和夫铭离开皇区之后，我们就一直在躲避这个皇帝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not to the extent of being thrown into a Dahlite prison. The Imperial appeal Will serve as a delay……in any case, a diversion……and perhaps in the course of that delay, we can think of something else."</p><p>“被丢进达尔监狱却更不妙。上诉御前是一种拖延战术……至少是一种牵制。也许在拖延过程中，我们能想到什么别的办法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Theres Hummin."</p><p>“还有夫铭呢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, there is," said Dors uneasily, "but we cant consider him the do-it-all. For one thing, even if my message reached him and even if he was able to rush to Dahl, how would he find us here? And, even if he did, what could he do against the entire Dahlite security force?"</p><p>“是的，还有他。”铎丝以不安的口气说，“但我们不能把他视为万灵丹。理由之一，即使我的讯息传到他那里，即使他能赶来达尔，他又如何在这里找到我们？还有，就算他找到我们，面对整个达尔的维安警力，他又能做些什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case," said Seldon. "Were going to have to think of something we can do before they find us."</p><p>“这样说来，”谢顿道，“在被他们找到之前，我们必须想个可行的办法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raych said, "If ya follow me, I can keep ya ahead of them. I know every place there is around here."</p><p>芮奇说：“如果你们跟着我，我能让你们一直走在他们前面。我知道附近每一个地方。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You can keep us ahead of one person, but therell be a great many, moving down any number of corridors. Well escape one group and bump into another."</p><p>“你可以让我们走在一个人前面，可是他们会有很多很多人，在所有的回廊中钻来钻去。我们躲过一组人，又会撞见另一组。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They sat in uncomfortable silence for a good while, each confronting what seemed to be a hopeless situation. Then Dors Venabili stirred and said in a tense, low whisper, "Theyre here. I hear them."</p><p>接下来有好一阵子，他们端坐在不安的沉默中，每个人都面对着一个似乎无望的局面。然后，铎丝·凡纳比里抖动了一下，以紧张而低沉的悄悄话说：“他们来了，我听到了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a while, they strained, listening, then Raych sprang to his feet and hissed, "They comin that way. We gotta go this way."</p><p>他们绷紧神经倾听了一会儿，然后芮奇突然跳起来，紧张地悄声道：“他们从那边来，我们得往这边走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon, confused, heard nothing at all, but would have been content to trust the others superior hearing, but even as Raych began moving hastily and quietly away from the direction of the approaching tread, a voice rang out echoing against the sewer walls. "Dont move. don't move."</p><p>谢顿相当疑惑，他什么也没听到，但他宁愿相信其他两人的超人听觉。不过就在芮奇开始迅速地、悄悄地朝脚步声相反的方向移动时，一个声音却突然响起，在下水道的墙壁上激起回声。“别走，别走。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Raych said, "Thats Davan. Howd he know we were here?"</p><p>芮奇立刻说：“那是达凡。他怎么知道我们在这里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Davan?" said Seldon. "Are you sure?"</p><p>“达凡？”谢顿说，“你确定吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure I'm sure. Hell help."</p><p>“我当然确定。他会帮助我们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Davan asked, "What happened?"</p><p>达凡说：“发生了什么事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt minimally relieved. Surely, the addition of Davan could scarcely count against the full force of the Dahl Sector, but, then again, he commanded a number of people who might create enough confusion.</p><p>谢顿勉勉强强松了一口气。当然，面对达尔区整个的警力，多了达凡一人几乎不算什么。不过话说回来，他指挥着一大批人，应该可以制造足够的混乱……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "You should know, Davan. I suspect that many of the crowd who were at Tisalvers place this morning were your people."</p><p>他说：“达凡，你应该都知道。我猜想今天早上在堤沙佛家门口聚集的群众，有许多都是你的手下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, a number were. The story is that you were being arrested and that you manhandled a squadron of Sunbadgers. But why were you being arrested?"</p><p>“没错，有不少都是。传闻是说你们遭到逮捕，而你们对付了一中队的徽子。但你们为什么会遭到逮捕呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Two," said Seldon, lifting two fingers. "Two Sunbadgers. And thats bad enough. Part of the reason we were being arrested was that we had gone to see you."</p><p>“两个，”谢顿一面说，一面举起两根指头，“两个徽子而已，但这就够糟了。我们遭到逮捕的部分原因，就是我们去见过你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thats not enough. The Sunbadgers don't bother with me much as a general thing." He added bitterly, "They underestimate me."</p><p>“那还不够，徽子不怎么把我当一回事。”他又以苦涩的口吻补充道，“他们低估了我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Maybe," said Seldon, "but the woman from whom we rent our rooms reported us for having started a riot……over the newsman we ran into on our way to you. You know about that. With your people on the scene yesterday and again this morning and with two officers badly hurt, they may well decide to clean out these corridors……and that means you Will suffer. I really am sorry. I had no intention or expectation of being the cause of any of this."</p><p>“或许吧，”谢顿说，“可是租房子给我们的那个女人，告发我们曾经掀起一场暴动……用来对付那名我们遇到的记者，你知道这回事。你的人昨天和今天早上都在现场，再加上两名警官受了重伤，他们很可能会决定扫清这些回廊……这就代表你要遭殃。我真的很抱歉，我从未打算或是指望引发其中任何一件事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Davan shook his head. "No, you don't know the Sunbadgers. Thats not enough either. They don't want to clean us up. The sector would have to do something about us if they did. Theyre only too happy to let us rot in Billibotton and the other slums. No, theyre after you. What have you done?"</p><p>达凡却摇了摇头。“不，你不了解那些徽子，这个理由还是不够。他们并不想清除我们，否则的话，这个区必须为我们做些安排。让我们在脐眼和其他贫民窟里腐烂，他们高兴还来不及呢。不，他们是要抓你们……你们。你们到底做了什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said impatiently, "Weve done nothing and, in any case, what does it matter? If theyre not after you and they are after us, theyre going to come down here to flush us out. If you get in the way, youll be in deep trouble."</p><p>铎丝不耐烦地说：“我们什么也没做，而且无论如何，这又有什么关系？假如他们不是在抓你，而真的是在抓我们，他们就会下来这里，把我们通通赶出去。你若挺身而出，就会有大麻烦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, not me. I have friends……powerful friends," said Davan. "I told you that last night. And they can help you as well as me. When you refused to help us openly, I got in touch with them. They know who you are, Dr. Seldon. Youre a famous man. Theyre in a position to talk to the Mayor of Dahl and see to it that you are left alone, whatever you have done. But youll have to be taken away……out of Dahl."</p><p>“不，我不会。我有些朋友……有权有势的朋友，昨晚我对你们说过。”达凡道，“他们能像帮我一样帮助你们。在你们拒绝公开帮我们之后，我和他们取得了联络。他们知道你是谁，谢顿博士，你是个名人。他们有资格和达尔区长直接通话，并能确保达尔放你们一马，不论你们做过什么。可是你们必须被带走……带离达尔。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon smiled. Relief flooded over him. He said, "You know someone powerful, do you, Davan? Someone who responds at once, who has the ability to talk the Dahl government out of taking drastic steps, and who can take us away? Good. I'm not surprised." He turned to Dors, smiling. "Its Mycogen all over again. How does Hummin do it?"</p><p>谢顿微微一笑，松懈感瞬间传遍全身。他说：“达凡，你认识一位有权有势的人，对不对？一位可以立即做出回应，有能力劝阻达尔政府采取激烈手段，而且能把我们带走的人？很好，我并不惊讶。”他带着笑容转向铎丝，“这完全是麦曲生的翻版。夫铭是怎么做到的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But Dors shook her head. "Too quick……I don't understand."</p><p>铎丝却摇了摇头。“太快了……我不懂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I believe he can do anything."</p><p>谢顿说：“我相信他做得到任何事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know him better than you do……and longer……and I don't believe that."</p><p>“我对他的认识比你更深，而且更久，但我不相信有这种事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon smiled, "Dont underestimate him." And then, as though anxious not to linger longer on that subject, he turned to Davan. "But how did you find us? Raych said you knew nothing about this place."</p><p>谢顿又微微一笑。“可别低估他。”然后，他仿佛急于转换话题，随即转向达凡说，“但你是怎样找到我们的？芮奇说你对此处毫不知情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He dont," shrilled Raych indignantly. "This place is all mine. I found it."</p><p>“他不知道。”芮奇愤慨地尖叫道，“这个地方只属于我，是我发现的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ive never been here before," said Davan, looking about. "Its an interesting place. Raych is a corridor creature, perfectly at home in this maze."</p><p>“我以前从未来过这里。”达凡一面说，一面环顾四周，“这是个有趣的地方。芮奇的确是个回廊生物，在这个迷宫中就像回到家一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, Davan, we gathered as much ourselves. But how did you find it?"</p><p>“没错，达凡，我们自己也推断出这么多。但你是怎么找来的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A heat-seeker. I have a device that detects infra-red radiation, the particular thermal pattern that is given off at thirty-seven degrees Celsius.
