<div class='layout'><p>9 Microfarm</p><p>第九章 微生农场</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MYCOGEN: …… The microfarms of Mycogen are legendary, though they survive today only in such oft-used similes as "rich as the microfarms of Mycogen" or "tasty as Mycogenian yeast." Such encomiums tend to intensify with time, to be sure, but Hari Seldon visited those microfarms in the course of The Flight and there are references in his memoirs that would tend to support the popular opinion……</p><p>麦曲生：……麦曲生的微生农场颇具传奇色彩，不过如今却仅保存于一些譬喻中，诸如“如同麦曲生微生农场那般丰饶”“有如麦曲生酵母那般美味”。事实上，这种赞美有与日俱增之势。但“逃亡期”的哈里·谢顿曾造访过那些微生农场，而他在回忆录中所记载的见闻，则倾向于支持这个公认的看法……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p><p>……《银河百科全书》</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That was good." said Seldon explosively. "It was considerably better than the food Graycloud brought……"</p><p>“真好吃！”谢顿爆出一声赞叹，“比灰云带来的食物好得多……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said reasonably, "You have to remember that Grayclouds woman had to prepare it on short notice in the middle of the night." She paused and said, "I wish they would say wife. They make woman sound like such an appanage, like my house or my robe. It is absolutely demeaning."</p><p>铎丝以中肯的态度说：“你别忘了，灰云的女人得在半夜临时准备。”她顿了顿，又说，“我真希望他们会说‘妻子’。他们让‘女人’听来只像一种附属品，就像‘我的房子’或‘我的袍子’一样。这绝对是贬抑的称呼。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know. Its infuriating. But they might well make wife sound like an appanage as well. Its the way they live and the Sisters don't seem to mind. You and I aren't going to change it by lecturing. Anyway, did you see how the Sisters did it?"</p><p>“我知道，这的确令人气愤。但他们大可让‘妻子’听来也像一种附属品。这是他们的生活方式，姐妹们似乎并不在意。你我不必劝喻他们做任何改变……不管这些，你看到两位姐妹如何烹饪了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I did and they made everything seem very simple. I doubted I could remember everything they did, but they insisted I wouldnt have to. I could get away with mere heating. I gathered the bread had some sort of microderivative added to it in the baking that both raised the dough and lent it that crunchy consistency and warm flavor. Just a hint of pepper, didn't you think?"</p><p>“看到了，她们让每件事看来都非常简单。我怀疑自己能否记得她们所做的一切，可是她们坚持没有这个必要，我只要会加热便能应付。我推测那些面包在烘焙过程中，曾经加入某种微生衍生物，不但让面团胀了起来，还让它带有爽脆的硬度和亲切的香味。只有一点点辛辣，你不觉得吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I couldnt tell, but whatever it was, I didn't get enough. And the soup. Did you recognize any of the vegetables?"</p><p>“我无法判断，但不论加了什么，我都没吃够。还有这碗汤，你认得出里面的蔬菜吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No."</p><p>“认不出来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what was the sliced meat? Could you tell?"</p><p>“这些肉片又是什么？你能分辨吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't think it was sliced meat, actually. We did have a lamb dish back on Cinna that it reminded me of."</p><p>“其实，我认为它并不是肉片，虽然它的确令我想起锡纳的羔羊肉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was certainly not lamb."</p><p>“绝不是羔羊肉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I said that I doubted it was meat aaaall……I don't think anyone outside Mycogen eats like this either. Not even the Emperor, Im sure. Whatever the Mycogenians sell is, Im willing to bet, near the bottom of the line. They save the best for themselves. We had better not stay here too long, Hari. If we get used to eating like this, well never be able to acclimatize ourselves to the miserable stuff they have outside." She laughed.</p><p>“我说过，我怀疑它根本不是肉类……我认为麦曲生以外的人都没吃过这样的好东西。就连皇帝也没有，我敢肯定。麦曲生卖出去的那些，我愿意打赌，全部是下等货色。他们把上好的留给自己享用。哈里，我们最好别在这里待太久。假如我们习惯了这种吃法，就再也不能适应外面那些低贱的食物。”说完她哈哈大笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon laughed too. He took another sip aaathe fruit juice, which tasted far more tantalizing than any fruit juice he had ever sipped before, and said, "listen, when Hummin took me to the University, we stopped at a roadside diner and had some food that was heavily yeasted. It tasted like…… No, never mind what it tasted like, but I wouldnt have thought it conceivable, then, that microfood could taste like this. I wish the Sisters were still here. It would have been polite to thank them."</p><p>谢顿也笑了起来。他又呷了一口果汁，那味道远比他喝过的任何果汁都醉人得多。“听我说，当夫铭带我到大学去的时候，我们曾经停在一个路边速食店，吃了一些添加浓重酵母的食物。味道好像……不，别管味道像什么，反正，当时我绝不会相信微生食品能有这种美味。我希望两位姐妹还在这里，礼貌上应该向她们致谢。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think they were quite aware of how we would feel. I remarked on the wonderful smell while everything was warming and they said, quite complacently, that it would taste even better."</p><p>“我想她们相当清楚我们会有什么感受。当菜肴还在加热的时候，我赞美着散发出来的绝妙香气，她们则以相当自满的口气说，其实吃起来味道会更好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The older one said that, I imagine."</p><p>“年纪较大的那个说的吧，我猜。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. The younger one giggled……And theyll be back. Theyre going to bring me a kirtle, so that I can go out to see the shops with them. And they made it clear I would have to wash my face if I was to be seen in public. They will show me where to buy some good-quality kirtles of my own and where I can buy ready-made meals of all kinds. All I'll have to do is heaaathem up. They explained that decent Sisters wouldnt do that, but would start from scratch. In fact, some of the meal they prepared for us was simply heated and they apologized for that. They managed to imply, though, that tribespeople couldnt be expected to appreciate true artistry in cooking, so that simply heating prepared food would do for us……They seem to take it for granted, by the way, that I will be doing all the shopping and cooking."</p><p>“没错，年轻的那个只是吃吃笑。她们还会再来，会帮我带一套裰服，这样我就能跟她们出去逛街。她们讲得很明白，我若想出现在公共场所，就必须把脸上的妆洗掉。她们会告诉我哪里能买到高级的裰服，还有哪里能买到各种熟食……我需要做的只有加热而已。她们解释说，有教养的姐妹都不会那样做，一定都会从头做起。事实上，在她们为我们准备的食物中，有些也是加热一下即可，她们还特地为此道歉。不过，她们在话中透露了一项讯息，那就是无法指望外族人懂得欣赏真正的厨艺，所以只要把熟食加热就能打发我们。对了，她们似乎认为，我理所当然会负责所有采购和烹饪的工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As we say at home, When in Trantor, do as the Trantorians do. "</p><p>“就好像我们家乡的一句俗话：在川陀行，如川陀人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I was sure that would be your attitude in this case."</p><p>“是啊，我早就知道你对这件事的态度会是这样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im only human," said Seldon.</p><p>“我只是个凡人。”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The usual excuse," said Dors with a small smile. </p><p>“老套的借口。”铎丝露出浅浅的微笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon leaned back with a satisfactory well-fI'lled feeling and said, "Youve been on Trantor for two years, Dors, so you might understand a few things that I don't. Is it your opinion thaaathis odd social system the Mycogenians have is part of a supernaturalistic view they have?"</p><p>谢顿带着一种心满意足的充实感仰靠在椅背上。“铎丝，你来川陀已经两年，所以你或许了解一些我不了解的事。在你的见解中，麦曲生这种古怪的社会系统，是不是他们的‘超自然宇宙观’的一环？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Supernaturalistic?"</p><p>“超自然？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Would you have heard that this was so?"</p><p>“对，你会不会刚好听说过？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What do you mean by supernaturalistic?"</p><p>“你所谓的‘超自然’是什么意思？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The obvious. A belief in entities that are independent of natural law, that are not bound by the conservation of energy, for instance, or by the existence of a constant of action."</p><p>“最明显的意思……相信某些实体独立于自然律之外，比如说不受能量守恒或作用量常数的限制。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I see. Youre asking if Mycogen is a religious community."</p><p>“我懂了，你是在问麦曲生是不是一个宗教性社会。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was Seldons turn. "Religious?"</p><p>这回轮到谢顿困惑不已。“宗教？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Its an archaic term, but we historians use it……our study is riddled with archaic terms. Religious is not precisely equivalent to supernaturalistic, though it contains richly supernaturalistic elements. I can't answer your specific question, however, because Ive never made any special investigation of Mycogen. still, from what little Ive seen of the place and from my knowledge of religions in history, I wouldnt be surprised if the Mycogenian society was religious in character."</p><p>“是的。这是个古老的词汇，不过我们历史学家经常使用……我们的研究充满古老的词汇。‘宗教’并不完全等同于‘超自然’，但它含有丰富的超自然成分。然而，我无法回答你这个特定的问题，因为我从未对麦曲生做过任何特别研究。话说回来，根据我在此地的一点所见所闻，以及我对古老宗教的认识，倘若麦曲生社会具有宗教本质，我也不会惊讶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In that case, would it surprise you if Mycogenian legends were also religious in character?"</p><p>“这样的话，如果麦曲生的传说也具有宗教本质，你会不会惊讶？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, it wouldnt."</p><p>“不会。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And therefore not based on historical matter?"</p><p>“因此没有历史根据？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That wouldnt necessarily follow. The core of the legends might still be authentically historic, allowing for distortion and supernaturalistic intermixture."</p><p>“这倒不一定。传说的核心仍有可能是货真价实的历史，只不过遭到扭曲，并掺杂了超自然的成分。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah," said Seldon and seemed to retire into his thoughts.</p><p>“啊。”谢顿说完之后，似乎便陷入沉思。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Finally Dors broke the silence that followed and said, "Its not so uncommon, you know. There is a considerable religious element on many worlds. Its grown stronger in the last few centuries as the Empire has grown more turbulent. On my world of Cinna, at least a quarter of the population is tritheistic."</p><p>最后由铎丝打破沉默，她说：“你知道吗，这没什么不寻常的。许多世界都带有可观的宗教成分，而过去这几个世纪，随着帝国越来越动荡，宗教的势力也越来越强。在我自己的世界锡纳，至少有四分之一人口是三神论的信徒。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was again painfully and regretfully conscious of his ignorance of history. He said, "Were there times in past history when religion was more prominent than it is today?"</p><p>谢顿再度察觉自己对历史的无知，因而深感痛苦与懊悔。他说：“历史上，有比如今更盛行宗教的时期吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Certainly. In addition, there are new varieties springing up constantly. The Mycogenian religion, whatever it might be, could be relatively new and may be restricted to Mycogen itself. I couldnt really tell without considerable study."</p><p>“当然有。除此之外，还不断有新生的派别冒出来。不论麦曲生拥有什么宗教，都有可能相当新颖，也或许仅局限于麦曲生一区。尚未进行深入研究之前，我不能下任何断言。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But now we get to the point of it, Dors. Is it your opinion that women are more apt to be religious than men are?"</p><p>“铎丝，可是现在我们谈到重点了。在你的见解中，女性是否比男性更具宗教倾向？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors Venabili raised her eyebrows. "Im not sure if we can assume anything as simple as that." She thought a bit. "I suspect that those elements of a population that have a smaller stake in the material natural world are more apt to find solace in what you call supernaturalism……the poor, the disinherited, the downtrodden. Insofar as supernaturalism overlaps religion, they may also be more religious. There are obviously many exceptions in both directions. Many of the downtrodden may lack religion; many of the rich, powerful, and satisfied may possess it."</p><p>铎丝·凡纳比里扬起双眉。“我不确定我们能否做这么简单的假设。”她稍微想了一下，“根据我的猜想，在物质世界中拥有较少本钱的成员，比较容易在你所谓的超自然论中找到慰藉，例如穷人、家世欠佳者，以及遭受压迫的人。在超自然论和宗教的交集部分，他们可能也会比较虔诚。但是两方面显然都有不少例外，许多受压迫者可能缺乏宗教信仰，许多有钱有势、生活安逸的人反而信教。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But in Mycogen," said Seldon, "where the women seem to be treated as subhuman……would I be right in assuming they would be more religious than the men, more involved in the legends that the society has been preserving?"</p><p>“可是在麦曲生，”谢顿说，“女性似乎被当成次等人类。我若假设她们比男性更具宗教倾向，更坚信这个社会所保存的种种传说，这样说正确吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I wouldnt risk my life on it, Hari, but Id be willing to risk a weeks income on it."</p><p>“我不会拿我的生命打赌，哈里，不过我愿意押上一周的收入。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Good," said Seldon thoughtfully.</p><p>“很好。”谢顿若有所思地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors smiled at him. "Theres a bit of your psychohistory, Hari. Rule number 47,854: The downtrodden are more religious than the satisfied."</p><p>铎丝对他微微一笑。“哈里，你的心理史学又多了一点内容。第47854条法则：受压迫者比生活安逸者更容易接受宗教。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head. "don't joke about psychohistory, Dors. You know Im not looking for tiny rules but for vast generalizations and for means of manipulation. I don't want comparative religiosity as the result of a hundred specific rules. I want something from which I can, after manipulation through some system of mathematicized logic, say, Aha, this group of people will tend to be more religious than that group, provided that the following criteria are met, and that, therefore, when humanity meets with these stimuli, it will react with these responses. "</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“铎丝，别拿心理史学开玩笑。你知道我不是在搜集细碎的法则，而是在寻找一般性的通则和操作的方法。我不要一百种特殊法则所导出的比较宗教学。我所要的东西，是藉由某种数学化逻辑系统的运作后，便能让我断言，‘啊哈，只要如下的判准全部符合，这群人就会比那群人更具宗教倾向。因此，当人类遇到这些刺激时，就会表现出这些反应来。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How horrible," said Dors. "You are picturing human beings as simple mechanical devices. Press this button and you will get that twitch."</p><p>“多可怕啊。”铎丝说，“你把人类看成简单的机械装置，只要按下这个按钮，就会得到那种抽动。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, because there will be many buttons pushing simultaneously to varying degrees and eliciting so many responses of different sorts that overall the predictions of the future will be statistical in nature, so that the individual human being will remain a free agent."</p><p>“并非如此，因为同时会有许多按钮，被按下的程度则各不相同，引发的反应因而五花八门不计其数。所以说，对未来的整体预测必将是统计性的，而每个人仍然都是自由因子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can you know this?"</p><p>“你怎么知道？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I cant," said Seldon. "At least, I don't know it. I feel it to be so. It is what I consider to be the way things ought to be. If I can find the axioms, the fundamental Laws of Humanics, so to speak, and the necessary mathematical treatment, then I will have my psychohistory. I have proved that, in theory, this is possible……"</p><p>“我无法知道。”谢顿说，“至少，我还不知道。我只是有这种感觉，认为事情应该这样才对。如果我能找到一组公设，比如说人性学基本定律，再加上必要的数学运算方法，我就会得到我想要的心理史学。我已经证明过，理论上是可能的……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But impractical, right?"</p><p>“但是并不实际？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I keep saying so."</p><p>“我一直都这样说。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A small smile curved Dorss lips, "Is that what you are doing, Hari, looking for some sort of solution to this problem?"</p><p>铎丝的嘴角露出一抹微笑。“哈里，这就是你正在做的吗，为这个问题寻找某种解答？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know. I swear to you I don't know. But Chetter Hummin is so anxious to find a solution and, for some reason, I am anxious to please him. He is so persuasive a man."</p><p>“我不知道，我向你发誓我不知道。可是契特·夫铭如此渴望找到一个答案，而且不知道为什么，我也渴望能满足他。他是如此具有说服力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I know."</p><p>“是的，我知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon let that comment pass, although a small frown flitted across his face. </p><p>谢顿并未深究这句话的意思，脸上却迅速掠过一丝愁容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon continued. "Hummin insists the Empire is decaying, that it will collapse, that psychohistory is the only hope for saving it……or cushioning it or ameliorating it……and that without it humanity will be destroyed or, at the very least, go through prolonged misery. He seems to place the responsibility for preventing that on me. Now, the Empire will certainly last my time, but if Im to live at ease, I must lift that responsibility from my shoulders. I must convince myself……and even convince Hummin……that psychohistory is not a practical way out that, despite theory, it cannot be developed. So I must follow up as many leads as I can and show that each one must fail."</p><p>谢顿继续说：“夫铭坚持帝国正在衰败，并说它终将崩溃，又说若想拯救帝国，或是缓冲或改善银河的命运，心理史学将是唯一的希望。他还说倘若没有心理史学，人类终将遭到毁灭，或至少会经历一段长久的悲惨岁月。他似乎把这个重责大任，摆到我一个人身上。虽然在我有生之年，帝国绝对不会崩溃，但我若想活得心安理得，就必须把这个重担卸下来。我必须说服自己……甚至要说服夫铭……心理史学并非实际可行的方法；尽管有理论，却无法真正建立。所以每条可能的途径我都得走走看，才能证明没有任何一条活路。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Leads? Like going back in history to a time when human society was smaller than it is now?"</p><p>“途径？像是回溯到人类社会小于如今的时代？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Much smaller. And far less complex."</p><p>“要小很多，而且简单得多。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And showing that a solution is still impractical?"</p><p>“然后证明实际上仍然无解。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes."</p><p>“没错。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But who is going to describe the early world for you? If the Mycogenians have some coherent picture of the primordial Galaxy, Sunmaster certainly won't reveal it to a tribesman. No Mycogenian will. This is an ingrown society……how many times have we already said it?……and its members are suspicious of tribesmen to the point of paranoia. Theyll tell us nothing."</p><p>“可是谁来为你描述那个早期世界呢？即使麦曲生人拥有太初银河的完整描述，日主也当然不会透露给一个外族人。没有任何麦曲生人会那么做。这是个故步自封的社会，这句成语我们用过多少次了？而且它的成员对外族人的提防已经到了偏执的地步，他们什么也不会告诉我们的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I will have to think of a way to persuade some Mycogenians to talk. Those Sisters, for instance."</p><p>“我必须想个办法说服某些麦曲生人开口，比如说那对姐妹。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They won't even hear you, male that you are, any more than Sunmaster hears me. And even if they do talk to you, what would they know but a few catch phrases?"</p><p>“她们甚至不会听到你说的话，因为你是男性，正如日主对我装聋作哑一样。即使她们愿意和你说话，除了几句口号之外，她们还会知道什么呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I must start somewhere."</p><p>“我必须从某处着手。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "Well, let me think. Hummin says I must protect you and I interpret that as meaning I must help you when I can. What do I know about religion? Thats nowhere near my specialty, you know. I have always dealt with economic forces, rather than philosophic forces, but you can't split history into neat little nonoverlapping divisions. For instance, religions tend to accumulate wealth when successful and that eventually tends to distort the economic development of a society. There, incidentally, is one of the numerous rules of human history that youll have to derive from your basic Laws of Humanics or whatever you called them. But……"</p><p>铎丝说：“好吧，让我想想。夫铭说过我必须保护你，我把这句话解释为必须尽力帮助你。我对宗教了解多少呢？你可知道，那和我的专长相隔甚远。我研究的一向是各种经济力量，而不是那些哲学性力量，可是，你不能把历史分割成许多毫不相交的小单元。举例而言，成功的宗教具有积聚财富的倾向，到头来就会扭曲一个社会的经济发展。顺便提一下，这是人类历史的无数法则之一，你的人性学基本定律，或者无论你管它叫什么，都必须能把它导出来。不过……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And here, Dorss voice faded away as she lapsed into thought. Seldon watched her cautiously and Dorss eyes glazed as though she was looking deep within herself.</p><p>说到这里，铎丝不知不觉陷入沉思，声音因此逐渐消失。谢顿仔细打量她，发现她的双眼呆滞无神，仿佛正在凝视自己内心深处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Finally she said, "This is not an invariable rule, but it seems to me that on many occasions, a religion has a book……or books……of significance; books that give their ritual, their view of history, their sacred poetry, and who knows what else. Usually, those books are open to all and are a means of proselytization. Sometimes they are secret."</p><p>最后她终于说：“有个并非一成不变的法则，我觉得在许多个案中，一种宗教都拥有一本或数本神圣的典籍，记载着他们的礼仪、他们的历史观、他们的圣诗，谁晓得还有些什么东西。通常这些典籍都对外公开，当做劝人皈依的一种工具。不过有些时候，也可能是不可示人的密典。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you think Mycogen has books of that sort?"</p><p>“你认为麦曲生有这种典籍吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To be truthful," said Dors thoughtfully, "I have never heard of any. I might have if they existed openly……which means they either don't exist or are kept secret. In either case, it seems to me you are not going to see them."</p><p>“说老实话，”铎丝语重心长地说，“我从没听说过。若是公开的典籍，我应该有所耳闻。这就代表它们或是不存在，或是一直被视为密典。不论何者为真，似乎你都见不到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"At least its a starting point," said Seldon grimly.</p><p>“这至少是个起点。”谢顿绷着脸说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Sisters returned about two hours after Hari and Dors had finished lunch. They were smiling, both of them, and Raindrop Forty-Three, the graver one, held up a gray kirtle for Dorss inspection.</p><p>大约谢顿与铎丝用过午餐两小时后，那对姐妹便再度来访。两人脸上都挂着微笑，较严肃的那位（雨点四十三）拿着一件裰服让铎丝检视。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is very attractive," said Dors, smiling widely and nodding her head with a certain sincerity. "I like the clever embroidery here."</p><p>“非常好看。”铎丝露出开怀的笑容，并以一种真诚的态度点着头。“我喜欢这部分的精巧刺绣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is nothing," twittered Raindrop Forty-Five. "It is one of my old things and it won't fit very well, for you are taller than I am. But it will do for a while and we will take you out to the very best kirtlery to get a few that will fit you and your tastes perfectly. You will see."</p><p>“没有什么。”雨点四十五以清脆的声音说，“它是我穿旧了的，而且不会非常合身，因为你比我高，但至少能凑合一下。我们会带你到最好的裰服店，买几件完全符合你的身材和品味的。到时你就知道了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Three, smiling a little nervously but saying nothing and keeping her eyes fixed on the ground, handed a white kirtle to Dors. It was folded neatly. Dors did not attempt to unfold it, but passed it on to Seldon. "From the color I should say its yours, Hari."</p><p>雨点四十三露出稍嫌紧张的微笑，不过什么也没说，只是将目光固定在地上，然后把一件白色裰服交给铎丝。那件裰服折叠得很整齐，铎丝并未想要打开，而是直接将它递给谢顿。“哈里，根据颜色判断，我敢说是给你的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Presumably," said Seldon, "but give it back. She did not give it to me."</p><p>“想必没错。”谢顿说，“但我要你还回去，她并没有直接拿给我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, Hari," mouthed Dors, shaking her head slightly.</p><p>“喔，哈里。”铎丝做出这几个字的口形，同时微微摇了摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No," said Seldon firmly. "She did not give it to me. Give it back to her and I'll wait for her to give it to me."</p><p>“不行。”谢顿坚决地说，“她并没有直接拿给我。把衣服还给她，我等她自己拿给我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors hesitated, then made a half-hearted attempt to pass the kirtle back to Raindrop Forty-Three.</p><p>铎丝迟疑了一下，然后勉强试图将那件裰服还给雨点四十三。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Sister put her hands behind her back and moved away, all life seeming to drain from her face. Raindrop Forty-Five stole a glance at Seldon, a very quick one, then took a quick step toward Raindrop Forty-Three and put her arms about her.</p><p>那位姐妹却将双手背到背后，身子闪开，脸上的血色似乎完全消失无踪。雨点四十五偷偷瞥了谢顿一眼，动作非常迅速，然后快步走向雨点四十三，张开双臂将她抱住。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said, "Come, Hari, Im sure that Sisters are not permitted to talk to men who are not related to them. Whats the use of making her miserable? She can't help it."</p><p>铎丝说：“好啦，哈里。我确信姐妹们不准和非亲非故的男性说话。你让她这么为难又有什么用？她根本身不由己。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't believe it," said Seldon harshly. "If there is such a rule, it applies only to Brothers. I doubt very much that shes ever met a tribesman before."</p><p>“我可不相信。”谢顿粗声道，“如果真有这样一条规定，也只适用于兄弟们。我非常怀疑她以前遇见过任何外族男子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors said to Raindrop Forty-Three in a soft voice, "Have you ever met a tribesman before, Sister, or a tribeswoman?"</p><p>铎丝以轻柔的声音对雨点四十三说：“姐妹，你遇见过外族男子，或是外族女子吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A long hesitation and then a slow negative shake of the head.</p><p>犹豫许久之后，她才慢慢摇了摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon threw out his arms. "Well, there you are. If there is a rule of silence, it applies only to the Brothers. Would they have sent these young women……these Sisters……to deal with us if there was any rule against speaking to tribesmen?"</p><p>谢顿摊开双臂。“好，你看吧。即使真有一条保持缄默的规定，它也只适用于兄弟们。若有任何禁止和外族男子说话的规定，他们还会派年轻女子……这两位姐妹……来帮我们吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It might be, Hari, that they were meant to speak only to me and I to you."</p><p>“或许是这样的，哈里，她们只能和我讲话，再由我转达给你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nonsense. I don't believe it and I won't believe it. I am not merely a tribesman, I am an honored guest in Mycogen, asked to be treated as such by Chetter Hummin and escorted here by Sunmaster Fourteen himself. I will not be treated as though I do not exist. I will be in communication with Sunmaster Fourteen and I will complain bitterly."</p><p>“简直荒谬。我可不信，永远不会相信。我不只是一名外族男子，我还是麦曲生的贵客；契特·夫铭要求他们将我待为上宾，日主十四亲自护送我来到此地。我不要被当成一个不存在的人，我会跟日主十四取得联络，还会向他大吐苦水。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Five began to sob and Raindrop Forty-Three, retaining her comparative impassivity, nevertheless flushed faintly. </p><p>雨点四十五开始啜泣，雨点四十三则保持着一贯无动于衷的态度，但脸孔也难免涨红少许。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors made as though to appeal to Seldon once again, but he stopped her with a brief and angry outward thrust of his right arm and then stared gloweringly at Raindrop Forty-Three.</p><p>铎丝好像打算再向谢顿说情，他却愤怒地猛然伸出右臂，阻止她做进一步的努力。然后，他皱着眉头凝视着雨点四十三。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And finally she spoke and did not twitter. Rather, her voice trembled hoarsely, as though she had to force it to sound in the direction of a male being and was doing so against all her instincts and desires. </p><p>最后她终于开口，但不再是清脆嘹亮之声。反之，她的声音颤抖而嘶哑，仿佛她必须用力将声音传到一名男性所在的位置，而这样做完全违背她的本能与意愿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>You must not complain of us, tribesman. That would be unjust. You force me to break the custom of our people. What do you want of me?</p><p>“外族男子，你不可以告我们的状，那是不公平的。你强迫我打破我们族人的习俗，到底想要我做什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon smiled disarmingly at once and held out his hand. "The garment you brought me. The kirtle."</p><p>谢顿立刻露出敌意尽消的笑容，并伸出一只手。“你带给我的那件衣服，那件裰服。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Silently, she stretched out her arm and deposited the kirtle in his hand. </p><p>她默默地伸长手臂，将裰服放到他手中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He bowed slightly and said in a soft warm voice, "Thank you, Sister." He then cast a very brief look in Dorss direction, as though to say: You see? But Dors looked away angrily.</p><p>他微微一欠身，以温和而热诚的声音说：“谢谢你，姐妹。”然后，他朝铎丝的方向迅速瞥了一眼，仿佛在说：你瞧？铎丝却气呼呼地转过头去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The kirtle was featureless, Seldon saw as he unfolded it (embroidery and decorativeness were for women, apparently), but it came with a tasseled belt that probably had some particular way of being worn. No doubt he could work it out.</p><p>这件裰服毫无特色，谢顿打开时便注意到这点（刺绣与装饰图样显然是女性裰服的专利）。不过它附有一条缀着流苏的腰带，也许需要以特殊方式穿戴。毫无疑问，这绝对难不倒他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "I'll step into the bathroom and put this thing on. It won't take but a minute, I suppose."</p><p>他说：“我要进浴室去把这玩意穿上。我想顶多一分钟吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He stepped into the small chamber and found the door would not close behind him because Dors was forcing her way in as well. Only when the two of them were in the bathroom together did the door close.</p><p>他走进狭小的浴室，却发现无法关上门，原来是铎丝也要挤进来。直到他们两人都进入浴室，那扇门才关了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What were you doing?" Dors hissed angrily. "You were an absolute brute, Hari. Why did you treat the poor woman that way?"</p><p>“你在做什么？”铎丝气冲冲地细声道，“哈里，你是一头不折不扣的野兽。你为何那样对待这个可怜的女子？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said impatiently, "I had to make her talk to me. Im counting on her for information. You know that. Im sorry I had to be cruel, but how else could I have broken down her inhibitions?" And he motioned her out.</p><p>谢顿不耐烦地说：“我必须让她和我说话。你也知道，我得靠她提供资料。我很抱歉不得不这样残酷，可是除此之外，我又如何能打破她的心防？”说完，他便示意要她出去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he emerged, he found Dors in her kirtle too. </p><p>当他走出浴室的时候，发现铎丝也换上了裰服。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dors, despite the bald head the skincap gave her and the inherent dowdiness of the kirtle, managed to look quite attractive. The stitching on the robe somehow suggested a figure without revealing it in the least. Her belt was wider than his own and was a slightly different shade of gray from her kirtle. Whats more, it was held in front by two glittering blue stone snaps. (Women did manage to beautify themselves even under the greatest difficulty, Seldon thought.)</p><p>虽然人皮帽使铎丝成了光头，而且裰服本身带有邋遢的感觉，她看来仍然相当迷人。这种袍子的剪裁只能呈现一个人形，无法衬托任何身形曲线。她的腰带比他的宽些，也和她自己的灰裰服颜色稍有不同。非但如此，它更借着正面两颗闪闪发光的蓝石按扣来固定。（即使在最困难的情况下，女性仍能设法美化自己，谢顿这么想。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Looking over at Hari, Dors said, "You look quite the Mycogenian now. The two of us are fit to be taken to the stores by the Sisters."</p><p>铎丝打量谢顿一遍，然后说：“你现在看起来相当像个麦曲生人，两位姐妹可以带我俩去逛街了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes," said Seldon, "but afterward I want Raindrop Forty-Three to take me on a tour of the microfarms."</p><p>“没错，”谢顿说，“可是逛完之后，我要雨点四十三带我去参观微生农场。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Threes eyes widened and she took a rapid step backward.</p><p>雨点四十三将双眼张得老大，立刻向后退了一步。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Id like to see them," said Seldon calmly.</p><p>“我很希望去看看。”谢顿以平静的口吻说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Three looked quickly at Dors. "Tribeswoman……"</p><p>雨点四十三马上望向铎丝。“外族女子……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "Perhaps you know nothing of the farms, Sister."</p><p>谢顿说：“姐妹，或许是你对那些农场一无所知。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That seemed to touch a nerve. She lifted her chin haughtily as she still carefully addressed Dors. "I have worked on the microfarms. All Brothers and Sisters do at some point in their lives."</p><p>这句话似乎触动了她的神经。她高傲地抬起下巴，但仍然刻意面对着铎丝说：“我曾在微生农场工作。所有的兄弟姐妹，一生总有一段时间在那里工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then, take me on the tour," said Seldon, "and lets not go through the argument again. I am not a Brother to whom you are forbidden to speak and with whom you may have no dealings. I am a tribesman and an honored guest. I wear this skincap and this kirtle so as not to attract undue attention, but I am a scholar and while I am here I must learn. I cannot sit in this room and stare at the wall. I want to see the one thing you have that the rest of the Galaxy does not have…… your microfarms. I should think youd be proud to show them."</p><p>“好啊，那么带我参观一下，”谢顿说，“我们就别再为这件事争论了。你不能和兄弟交谈，也不能和他们有任何来往，但我却不是你们的兄弟。我是一名外族男子，也是一位贵客。我穿戴着人皮帽和裰服，以免吸引太多的注意，但我是一名学者，我在此地这段期间必须继续学习。我不能坐在这个房间，对着墙壁干瞪眼。我要看看全银河只有你们才有的东西……你们的微生农场。我以为你会骄傲地带我去开眼界。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We are proud," said Raindrop Forty-Three, finally facing Seldon as she spoke, "and I will show you and don't think you will learn any of our secrets if that is what you are after. I will show you the microfarms tomorrow morning. It will take time to arrange a tour."</p><p>“我们的确引以为傲，”雨点四十三终于面对谢顿开口，“我也会带你去开眼界。你若想藉此打探我们的任何秘密，我相信你绝对无法得逞。明天早上我再带你去看微生农场，安排这种参观需要花点时间。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I will wait tI'll tomorrow morning. But do you promise? Do I have your word of honor?"</p><p>谢顿说：“我愿意等到明天早上。可是你真的答应吗？你以荣誉向我担保吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Three said with clear contempt, "I am a Sister and I will do as I say. I will keep my word, even to a tribesman." </p><p>雨点四十三带着明显的轻蔑说道：“我是一名姐妹，我言出必行。即使是对一名外族男子，我也会说话算数。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her voice grew icy at the last words, while her eyes widened and seemed to glitter. Seldon wondered what was passing through her mind and felt uneasy.</p><p>她最后几个字的声音越来越冰冷，但她的眼睛却张得很大，而且目光如炬。谢顿不禁怀疑有什么念头掠过她心底，因而感到一阵不安。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon passed a restless night. </p><p>谢顿又过了不得安宁的一夜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To begin with, Dors had announced that she must accompany him on the tour of the microfarm and he had objected strenuously. </p><p>首先，铎丝宣称一定要陪他参观微生农场，他则极力表示反对。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The whole purpose," he said, "is to make her talk freely, to present her with an unusual environment……alone with a male, even if a tribesman. Having broken custom so far, it will be easier to break it further. If youre along, she will talk to you and I will only get the leavings."</p><p>“整个行动的目的，”他说，“就是要让她自由自在地说话，要让她处于一个不寻常的环境……和一名男性独处，即使是一名外族男子。破除那么多习俗之后，就会更容易打破更多。如果你跟来，她会专门和你讲话，而我就只能捡些残渣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And if something happens to you in my absence, as it did Upperside?"</p><p>“万一因为我不在场，你又像在上方那样发生什么变故，那可怎么办？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing will happen. Please! If you want to help me, stay away. If not, I will have nothing further to do with you. I mean it, Dors. This iiiimportant to me. Much as Ive grown fond of you, you cannot come ahead of this."</p><p>“不会发生任何变故。拜托！你若想帮我，就不要插手。如果你不肯，那我再也不要和你有任何瓜葛。铎丝，我是说真的。这件事对我很重要，虽然我越来越喜欢你，也不能把你摆在它前面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She agreed with enormous reluctance and said only, "Promise me youll at least be nice to her, then."</p><p>她极不情愿地勉强答应，只说了一句：“那么，答应我至少你会善待她。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Seldon said, "Is it me you must protect or her? I assure you that I didn't treat her harshly for pleasure and I won't do so in the future."</p><p>谢顿说：“你要保护的是我还是她？我向你保证，我对她粗暴不是为了找乐子，而我以后再也不会那么做了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The memory of this argument with Dors……their first……helped keep him awake a large part of the night; that, together with the nagging thought that the two Sisters might not arrive in the morning, despite Raindrop Forty-Threes promise. </p><p>与铎丝的这番争执……他们的第一次争执……萦绕在他的脑海，令他大半夜无法成眠。雪上加霜的是，虽然雨点四十三曾郑重保证，他还是一直担心那对姐妹明早可能会爽约。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They did arrive, however, not long after Seldon had completed a spare breakfast (he was determined not to grow fat through overindulgence) and had put on a kirtle that fitted him precisely. He had carefully organized the belt so that it hung perfectly.</p><p>然而，她们却准时出现了。当时谢顿刚吃完一顿简陋的早餐（他决心不要因为耽溺于美食而发胖），穿上了那件十分合身的裰服。他曾仔细调整那条腰带，将它固定在完全正确的位置。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Three, still with a touch of ice in her eye, said, "if you are ready, Tribesman Seldon, my sister will remain with Tribeswoman Venabili." Her voice was neither twittery nor hoarse. It was as though she had steadied herself through the night, practicing, in her mind, how to speak to one who was a male but not a Brother.</p><p>雨点四十三的眼神还是有些冰冷，她说：“外族男子谢顿，你准备好了吧，我妹妹会留下来陪伴外族女子凡纳比里。”她的声音既不清脆也不嘶哑，仿佛她花了一夜的时间来稳定情绪，并在心中练习如何与一位并非兄弟的男性交谈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon wondered if she had lost sleep and said, "I am quite ready."</p><p>谢顿怀疑她是否也曾失眠，但他只是说：“我都准备好了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Together, half an hour later, Raindrop Forty-Three and Hari Seldon were descending level upon level. Though it was daytime by the clock, the light was dusky and dimmer than it had been elsewhere on Trantor. </p><p>半小时后，雨点四十三与哈里·谢顿两人开始一层层往下走。虽然目前的时刻属于白昼，可是此地光线昏暗，比川陀其他各处都要黯淡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was no obvious reason for this. Surely, the artificial daylight that slowly progressed around the Trantorian sphere could include the Mycogen Sector. The Mycogenians must want it that way, Seldon thought, clinging to some primitive habit. Slowly Seldons eyes adjusted to the dim surroundings. </p><p>这似乎没有明显的原因。不用说，缓缓绕行川陀表面的人工日光不至于遗漏麦曲生区。但是为了固守某种原始的习惯，谢顿想，麦曲生人一定是故意这样做的。不久之后，谢顿的眼睛慢慢适应了幽暗的环境。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon tried to meet the eyes of passersby, whether Brothers or Sisters, calmly. He assumed he and Raindrop Forty-Three would be taken as a Brother and his woman and that they would be given no notice as long as he did nothing to attract attention.</p><p>谢顿试着冷静地迎向路人的目光，不论是来自兄弟或姐妹的。他假定自己会被当做一名兄弟，而雨点四十三则是他的女人，只要他不做出招摇的举动，就不会有人注意他们两人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Unfortunately, it seemed as if Raindrop Forty-Three wanted to be noticed. She talked to him in few words and in low tones out of a clenched mouth. It was clear that the company of an unauthorized male, even though only she knew this fact, raved her self-confidence. Seldon was quite sure that if he asked her to relax, he would merely make her that much more uneasy. (Seldon wondered what she would do if she met someone who knew her. He felt more relaxed once they reached the lower levels, where human beings were fewer.)</p><p>不幸的是，雨点四十三却仿佛想要引人注意。她和他的对话都只有几个字，低沉的声音一律从紧闭的嘴巴发出来。显然，陪同一位名不正言不顺的男性，即使只有她自己知道这个事实，也完全摧毁了她的自信。谢顿相当肯定，自己倘若请她放松心情，只会使她变得加倍不安。谢顿很纳闷，如果她遇到熟人会有什么反应。直到他们来到较低的层级，路人变得较少的时候，他才总算比较宽心。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The descent was not by elevators either, but by moving staired ramps that existed in pairs, one going up and one going down. Raindrop Forty-Three referred to them as "escalators." Seldon wasn't sure he had caught the word correctly, never having heard it before.</p><p>他们搭乘的并非升降机，而是成对的一组活动阶梯坡道，其中一个向上升，另一个向下降。雨点四十三称之为“自动扶梯”，谢顿不确定有没有听错，因为他从未听过这个名称。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As they sank to lower and lower levels, Seldons apprehension grew. Most worlds possessed microfarms and most worlds produced their own varieties of microproducts. Seldon, back on Helicon, had occasionally shopped for seasonings in the microfarms and was always aware of an unpleasant stomach-turning stench. </p><p>他们一层一层往下降，谢顿的焦虑则一点一点向上升。大多数世界都拥有微生农场，也都生产自家的微生作物。谢顿在赫利肯的时候，偶尔也会到微生农场买调味品，每次总会闻到一股令人反胃的恶臭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The people who worked at the microfarms didn't seem to mind. Even when casual visitors wrinkled their noses, they seemed to acclimate themselves to it. Seldon, however, was always peculiarly susceptible to the smell. He suffered and he expected to suffer now. He tried soothing himself with the thought that he was nobly sacrificing his comfort to his need for information, but that didn't keep his stomach from turning itself into knots in apprehension.</p><p>在微生农场工作的人似乎并不在意，即使访客们皱起鼻子，他们自己却好像毫无感觉。然而，谢顿一向对那种味道特别敏感。他总是受这种罪，这回也做好了心理准备。他试图在心中安慰自己，他是因为需要搜集资料，才会做出这么高贵的牺牲。但这样做毫无用处，他的胃照样在焦虑中扭成一团。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After he had lost track of the number of levels they had descended, with the air still seeming reasonably fresh, he asked, "When do we get to the microfarm levels?"</p><p>等到他数不清下了多少层级，而空气似乎仍然相当清新时，他忍不住问道：“我们何时才会抵达微生农场的层级？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Were there now."</p><p>“现在已经到了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon breathed deeply. "It doesnt smell as though we are."</p><p>谢顿深深吸了一口气。“闻起来并不像。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Smell? What do you mean?" Raindrop Forty-Three was offended enough to speak quite loudly.</p><p>“闻起来？你是什么意思？”雨点四十三相当生气，嗓门突然变大不少。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There was always a putrid odor associated with microfarms, in my experience. You know, from the fertilizer that bacteria, yeast, fungi, and saprophytes generally need."</p><p>“根据我的经验，微生农场总有一股腐败的臭味。你该知道，那是从细菌、酵母菌、真菌，以及腐生植物所需要的肥料中散发出来的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In your experience?" Her voice lowered again. "Where was that?"</p><p>“根据你的经验？”她的音量再度降低，“那是在哪里？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On my home world."</p><p>“在我的母星。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Sister twisted her face into wild repugnance. "And your people wallow in gabelle?"</p><p>这位姐妹的脸孔扭成厌恶至极的表情。“你的同胞偏偏爱吃拉汲？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon had never heard the word before, but from the look and the intonation, he knew what it meant.</p><p>谢顿从未听过这种说法，不过根据她的表情与语气，他明白那是什么意思。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "It doesnt smell like that, you understand, once it is ready for consumption."</p><p>他说：“你该了解，端上餐桌的时候，就不会再有那种味道了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ours doesnt smell like that aaaany time. Our biotechnicians have worked out perfect strains. The algae grow in the purest light and the most carefully balanced electrolyte solutions. The saprophytes are fed on beautifully combined organics. The formulas and recipes are something no tribespeople will ever know. Come on, here we are. Sniff all you want. Youll find nothing offensive. That is one reason why our food is in demand throughout the Galaxy and why the Emperor, we are told, eats nothing else, though it is far too good for a tribesman if you ask me, even if he calls himself Emperor." </p><p>“我们的产品任何时候都没有那种味道，我们的生物科技人员研发出了完美的品系。藻类生长在最纯的光线和尽可能平衡的电解溶液中，腐生植物的养分则是精心调配的有机物质。那些公式和配方都是外族人不会知道的……来吧，我们到了。你尽量闻吧，绝对闻不到任何异味。这就是为什么全银河都欢迎我们的食品，而且听说皇帝绝不吃其他东西。但如果你问我，我会说外族人都不配享用那么好的食品，就算他自称皇帝也一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said it with an anger that seemed directly aimed at Seldon. Then, as though afraid he might miss that, she added, "Or even if he calls himself an honored guest."</p><p>她话中带着一股怒气，矛头似乎直指谢顿。然后，她仿佛怕他没听出来，又补充道：“或者，就算他自称贵客也一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They stepped out into a narrow corridor, on each side of which were large thick glass tanks in which roiled cloudy green water full of swirling, growing algae, moving about through the force of the gas bubbles that streamed up through it. They would be rich in carbon dioxide, he decided. </p><p>他们来到一个狭窄的回廊，两侧都有许多又大又厚重的玻璃槽，浑浊的暗绿色溶液里长满团团转的藻类，受到上升气泡的推动而不断摇晃。里面一定充满二氧化碳，他这么判断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Rich, rosy light shone down into the tanks, light that was much brighter than that in the corridors. He commented thoughtfully on that.</p><p>浓烈的蔷薇色光线照在这些玻璃槽上，这种光线比长廊的照明强了许多，他若有所思地发表这个评论。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course," she said. "These algae work best at the red end of the spectrum."</p><p>“当然。”她说，“这些藻类在光谱红端长得最好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I presume," said Seldon, "that everything is automated."</p><p>“我想，”谢顿说，“一切都是自动的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She shrugged, but did not respond.</p><p>她耸了耸肩，但未做出回应。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't see quantities of Brothers and Sisters in evidence," Seldon said, persisting.</p><p>“我没看到附近有许多兄弟姐妹。”谢顿毫不放松地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nevertheless, there is work to be done and they do it, even if you don't see them at work. The details are not for you. don't waste your time by asking about it."</p><p>“纵使如此，还是有工作要做，而他们做得很好，虽然你没看到他们在工作。细节不是给你看的，不要浪费时间问这些事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wait. don't be angry with me. I don't expect to be told state secrets. Come on, dear." (The word slipped out.)</p><p>“等一等，别生我的气。我并不指望听到什么国家机密。好啦，亲爱的。”他一不小心说溜了嘴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He took her arm as she seemed on the point of hurrying away. She remained in place, but he felt her shudder slightly and he released her in embarrassment. </p><p>正在她似乎要匆忙离去时，他抓住她的手臂，令她留在原处。但他感到她在微微颤抖，遂在一阵尴尬中将手松开。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He said, "Its just that it seems automated."</p><p>他说：“只不过在我看来，一切都是自动的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Make what you wish of the seeming. Nevertheless, there is room here for human brains and human judgment. Every Brother and Sister has occasion to work here at some time. Some make a profession of it."</p><p>“随便你爱怎样想都可以。然而，这里仍有需要脑力和判断力的地方。每位兄弟和姐妹，一生中总有一段时间在此工作，有些人还将它当成专业。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was speaking more freely now but, to his continuing embarrassment, he noticed her left hand move stealthily toward her right arm and gently rub the spot where he had touched her, as though he had stung her. </p><p>现在她说话更为自由自在，但他仍旧感到尴尬，因为他注意到，她的左手偷偷移向右臂，轻抚着刚才被他抓过的地方，仿佛那儿曾经被他刺了一下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It goes on for kilometers and kilometers, she said, "but if we turn here therell he a portion of the fungal section you can see."</p><p>“它们绵延无数公里，”她说，“不过我们若在这里转弯，你就能看到一片真菌区。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They moved along. Seldon noted how clean everything was. The glass sparkled. The tiled floor seemed moist, though when he seized a moment to bend and touch it, it wasnt. Nor was it slippery……unless his sandals (with his big toe protruding in approved Mycogenian fashion) had nonslip soles. </p><p>他们继续前进，谢顿注意到每样东西都清洁无比，连玻璃也晶莹剔透。瓷砖地板似乎是湿的，等到他趁机弯腰摸了一下，却发觉并非如此。而且地板也不滑，或许是他的凉鞋具有防滑鞋底（根据麦曲生社会的习俗，他将拇趾大大方方伸在外面）。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Three was right in one respect. Here and there a Brother or a Sister worked silently, studying gauges, adjusting controls, sometimes engaged in something as unskI'lled as polishing equipment……always absorbed in whatever they were doing.</p><p>有一件事雨点四十三的确没说错。不时可见兄弟或姐妹在默默工作，例如判读量具、调整控制装置，还有些做着诸如擦拭设备这类毫无技术性的工作……不论做的是什么，每个人都全神贯注。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon was careful not to ask what they were doing, since he did not want to cause the Sister humiliation in having to answer that she did not know or anger in her having to remind him there were things he must not know. </p><p>谢顿小心地避免问及他们在做些什么，他不想让这位姐妹因为答不出来而感到羞愧，也不想让她因为必须提醒他别乱打听而发脾气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They passed through a lightly swinging door and Seldon suddenly noticed the faintest touch of the odor he remembered. He looked at Raindrop Forty-Three, but she seemed unconscious of it and soon he too became used to it. </p><p>他们通过一扇微微摇摆的门，谢顿突然察觉到一丝记忆中的味道。他向雨点四十三望去，但她似乎浑然不觉，而他自己也很快就习惯了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The character of the light changed suddenly. The rosiness was gone and the brightness too. All seemed to be in a twilight except where equipment was spotlighted and wherever there was a spotlight there seemed to be a Brother or a Sister. Some wore lighted headbands that gleamed with a pearly glow and, in the middle distance, Seldon could see, here and there, small sparks of light moving erratically.</p><p>光线的特征忽然起了重大变化，蔷薇色调与明亮的感觉通通消失。除了有聚光灯为各项设备照明外，四周似乎都笼罩在昏黄的光芒中。在每个聚光处，好像都有一名兄弟或姐妹，有些还戴着发出珍珠般光辉的头带。而在不远的地方，谢顿可以看到四下都有细小的闪光在做不规则运动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As they walked, he cast a quick eye on her profile. It was all he could really judge by. At all other times, he could not cease being conscious of her bulging bald head, her bare eyes, her colorless face. They drowned her individuality and seemed to make her invisible. Here in profile, however, he could see something. Nose, chin, full lips, regularity, beauty. The dim light somehow smoothed out and softened the great upper desert.</p><p>当两人并肩行走时，他朝她的侧面瞥了一眼，那是他能评价她的唯一依据。在其他任何时候，他总是忘不掉她突出的光头、无眉的双眼，以及一张素净的脸庞。它们掩盖了她的个体性，似乎使她变得隐形。然而从这个轮廓中，他却能看出一些别的：鼻子、下巴、丰唇、匀称、美丽。黯淡的光线好像使那个大沙漠不再那么显眼与刺眼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He thought with surprise: She could be very beautiful if she grew her hair and arranged it nicely. </p><p>他惊讶地想到，如果留起头发并好好修剪，她可能就是个大美人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then he thought that she couldnt grow her hair. She would be bald her whole life. </p><p>然后他又想到，她无法长出头发，她这一生注定永远光头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Why? Why did they have to do that to her? Sunmaster said it was so that a Mycogenian would know himself (or herself) for a Mycogenian all his (or her) life. Why was that so important that the curse of hairlessness had to be accepted as a badge or mark of identity?</p><p>为什么呢？他们为什么一定要让她变成这样？日主说，是为了使麦曲生人一辈子记得自己是麦曲生人。这点为何那么重要，以致大家都得接受脱毛的诅咒，作为身份的象征与标记？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then, because he was used to arguing both sides in his mind, he thought: Custom is second nature. Be accustomed to a bald head, sufficiently accustomed, and hair on it would seem monstrous, would evoke nausea. He himself had shaved his face every morning, removing all the facial hair, uncomfortable at the merest stubble, and yet he did not think of his face as bald or as being in any way unnatural. Of course, he could grow his facial hair at any time he wished……but he didn't wish to do so.</p><p>然后，因为他习惯从正反两方面思考问题，于是又想到，习俗是第二天性，如果习惯了光头，到了根深蒂固的地步，那么头发就会显得怪异恐怖，令人感到恶心与厌恶。他自己每天早上都会刮脸，将胡须完全除去，剩下一点点胡根都不舒服。但他并不认为自己的脸是秃的，或是有任何不自然。当然，只要他愿意，随时可以留胡子，但他就是不愿那么做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He knew that there were worlds on which the men did not shave; in some, they did not even clip or shape the facial hair but let it grow wild. What would they say if they could see his own bald face, his own hairless chin, cheek, and lips?</p><p>他知道在某些世界上，男人一律不刮脸；甚至有些世界的男人根本不修剪胡须，任由它胡乱生长。如果让他们看到自己光秃的脸庞、没有任何胡须的下巴、双颊与嘴唇，他们又会怎么说呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> And meanwhile, he walked with Raindrop Forty-Three……endlessly, it seemed……and every once in a while she guided him by the elbow and it seemed to him that she had grown accustomed to that, for she did not withdraw her hand hastily. Sometimes it remained for nearly a minute.</p><p>他一面想，一面跟着雨点四十三向前走，这条路似乎没有尽头。每隔一会儿，她就会拉着他的手肘引导他。在他的感觉中，她似乎越来越习惯这样做，因为她并未急忙缩回手去，有时还持续将近一分钟。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She said, "Here! Come here!"</p><p>她说：“这里！到这里来！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is that?" asked Seldon.</p><p>“那是什么？”谢顿问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were standing before a small tray fI'lled with little spheres, each about two centimeters in diameter. A Brother who was tending the area and who had just placed the tray where it was looked up in mild inquiry.</p><p>他们站在一个小盘子前面，盘内装满了小型球体，每个球体的直径大约二厘米。有位兄弟在照顾这一区，刚才就是他将盘子放在那里的。此时他抬起头来，带着和气的询问神情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Three said to Seldon in a low voice, "Ask for a few."</p><p>雨点四十三低声对谢顿说：“向他要一些。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon realized she could not speak to a Brother until spoken to and said uncertainly, "May we have a few, B……brother?"</p><p>谢顿明白她不能主动和一位兄弟说话，除非对方先开口。于是他以迟疑的口气说：“我们能要一些吗，兄……兄弟？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have a handful, Brother," said the other heartily.</p><p>“兄弟，拿一把吧。”对方热诚地答道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon plucked out one of the spheres and was on the point of handing it to Raindrop Forty-Three when he noticed that she had accepted the invitation as applying to herself and reached in for two handfuls. </p><p>谢顿抓起一个球体，正准备递给雨点四十三，却发现她已将对方的好意解释为同样适用于她，已经伸手拿了两大把。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sphere felt glossy, smooth. Seldon said to Raindrop Forty-Three as they moved away from the vat and from the Brother who was in attendance, "Are these supposed to be eaten?" He lifted the sphere cautiously to his nose.</p><p>这种球体感觉上光滑柔润。等到他们离开那个培养桶以及照料该区的那位兄弟之后，谢顿对雨点四十三说：“这些能吃吗？”他举起那个球体，小心翼翼地凑到鼻端。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They don't smell," she said sharply.</p><p>“它们没有味道。”她突然冒出一句。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What are they?"</p><p>“它们究竟是什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Dainties. Raw dainties. For the outside market theyre flavored in different ways, but here in Mycogen we eat them unflavored……the only way." </p><p>“美食，未经加工的美食。销到外界的，会经过各种方式的调味，可是在麦曲生，我们一律吃原味……唯一的吃法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She put one in her mouth and said, "I never have enough."</p><p>她放进嘴里一个，然后说：“我怎么也吃不够。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon put his sphere into his mouth and felt it dissolve and disappear rapidly. His mouth, for a moment, ran liquid and then it slid, almost of its own accord, down his throat.</p><p>谢顿将手上的球体放入嘴里，感觉它迅速溶化殆尽。一时之间，他嘴里出现一股流动的液体，然后几乎自动滑进他的喉咙。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He stood for a moment, amazed. It was slightly sweet and, for that matter, had an even fainter bitter aftertaste, but the main sensation eluded him. </p><p>他停了一下脚步，感到相当惊讶。它有一点点甜味，后来甚至出现一丝更淡的苦味，但主要的感觉却令他难以捉摸。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>May I have another? he said.</p><p>“我能再吃一个吗？”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have half a dozen," said Raindrop Forty-Three, holding out her hand. "They never have quite the same taste twice and have practically no calories. Just taste."</p><p>“再吃五六个吧。”雨点四十三一面说，一面向他伸出手，“它们从来没有重复的口味，而且根本不含热量，只有味道而已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was right. He tried to have the dainty linger in his mouth; he tried licking it carefully; tried biting off a piece. However, the most careful lick destroyed it. When a bit was crunched off apiece, the rest of it disappeared at once. And each taste was undefinable and not quite like the one before.</p><p>她说得没错。他试图让这种美食在口中多留一会儿；试图小心地舔着；试图咬下一小口。然而，不论他多么小心，它也经不住轻轻的一舔。而只要稍微咬下一点，其余部分也立刻消失。每个球体的味道都无以名状，而且都和先前吃的不尽相同。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The only trouble is," said the Sister happily, "that every once in a while you have a very unusual one and you never forget it, but you never have it again either. I had one when I was nine……" Her expression suddenly lost its excitement and she said, "Its a good thing. It teaches you the evanescence of things of the world."</p><p>“唯一的麻烦是，”这位姐妹快活地说，“偶尔你会吃到一个非常特殊的口味，令你终身难忘，可是你却再也碰不到了。我九岁的时候吃过一个……”她的兴奋表情突然敛去，“这是一件好事，让你体认到世事的无常。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was a signal, Seldon thought. They had wandered about aimlessly long enough. She had grown used to him and was talking to him. And now the conversation had to come to its point. Now!</p><p>这是个讯号，谢顿心想。他们漫无目标地逛了许久，她已经开始习惯他，而且主动和他说话。现在，他们一定要进入正题。就是现在！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "I come from a world which lies out in the open, Sister, as all worlds do but Trantor. Rain comes or doesnt come, the rivers trickle or are in flood, temperature is high or low. That means harvests are good or bad. Here, however, the environment is truly controlled. Harvests have no choice but to be good. How fortunate Mycogen is."</p><p>谢顿说：“姐妹，我来自一个露天的世界。其实除了川陀之外，其他世界都是那样。雨水时有时无，河水不是太少就是泛滥，温度不是太高就是太低，这就代表收成有好有坏。然而在此地，环境真正受到控制，收成想不好也不行。麦曲生多么幸运啊。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He waited. There were different possible answers and his course of action would depend on which answer came.</p><p>他开始等待。她的回答可能会有几种不同的方式，他的行动方针将视她如何回答而定。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was speaking quite freely now and seemed to have no inhibitions concerning his masculinity, so this long tour had served its purpose. Raindrop Forty-Three said, "The environment is not that easy to control. There are, occasionally, viral infections and there are sometimes unexpected and undesirable mutations. There are times when whole vast batches wither or are worthless."</p><p>现在她说话已经自由自在，似乎对他这位男性不再有任何心防，所以这趟长途旅程的目的业已达到。雨点四十三说：“环境也不是那么容易控制。偶尔会有病毒感染，有时还会有意料之外的不良突变。还有一些时候，大批作物会整个枯萎或变得毫无价值。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You astonish me. And what happens then?"</p><p>“你这话令我惊讶。那时会怎样处理？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There is usually no recourse but to destroy the spoiled batches, even those that are merely suspected of spoilage. Trays and tanks must be totally sterilized, sometimes disposed of altogether."</p><p>“通常都没什么办法，只好把腐坏的那批尽数销毁，甚至包括那些仅有腐坏嫌疑的。盘子和水槽一定都要完全消毒，有时还得全部丢弃。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It amounts to surgery, then," said Seldon. "You cut out the diseased tissue."</p><p>“那么，这等于是一种外科手术。”谢顿说，“将染病的组织切除。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes."</p><p>“没错。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what do you do to prevent such things from happening?"</p><p>“你们如何预防这些情况？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What can we do? We test constantly for any mutations that may spring up, any new viruses that may appear, any accidental contamination or alteration of the environment. It rarely happens that we detect anything wrong, but if we do, we take drastic action. The result is that bad years are very few and even bad years affect only fractional bits here and there. The worst year weve ever had fell short of the average by only 12 percent……though that was enough to produce hardship. The trouble is that even the most careful forethought and the most cleverly designed computer programs can't always predict what is essentially unpredictable."</p><p>“我们能怎么办？我们不停地进行测试，看看有没有可能的突变，有没有可能的新病毒，有没有意外的污染或环境的变化。我们很少会侦测到什么问题，但若是发现了，我们就会采取非常措施。这样做的结果，使得歉收的年分非常少，而且纵然歉收，也只是对部分地区稍有影响。历史上收成最差的一年，只比平均年产量少了百分之十二，不过已经足以造成困境。问题是，即使是最谨慎的深谋远虑，以及设计得最高明的电脑程序，也无法百分之百预测本质上不可预测的事物。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Seldon felt an involuntary shudder go through him. It was as though she was speaking of psychohistory……but she was only speaking of the microfarm produce of a tiny fraction of humanity, while he himself was considering all the mighty Galactic Empire in every one of all its activities.) </p><p>谢顿觉得一阵颤栗不由自主传遍全身，因为她说的仿佛就是心理史学……事实上，她只是在谈论极少数人所经营的微生农场。而他自己，却是从各个层面在考虑这个庞大的银河帝国。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Unavoidably disheartened, he said, "Surely, its not all unpredictable. There are forces that guide and that care for us all."</p><p>这使他无可避免地感到气馁，他说：“当然，也并非全然不可预测。有些力量在引导、在照顾我们每一个人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Sister stiffened. She turned around toward him, seeming to study him with her penetrating eyes. </p><p>这位姐妹突然僵住。她转头望向谢顿，似乎是以具有透视力的目光在打量他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But all she said was "What?"</p><p>但她却只是说：“什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt uneasy. "It seems to me that in speaking of viruses and mutations, were talking about the natural, about phenomena that are subject to natural law. That leaves out of account the supernatural, doesnt it? It leaves out that which is not subject to natural law and can, therefore, control natural law."</p><p>谢顿觉得坐立不安。“在我的感觉中，谈到病毒和突变这些话题时，我们只是在讨论自然界的事物、那些服从自然律的各种现象。我们并未考虑到超自然，对不对？并没有包括不受制于自然律，进而能控制自然律的力量。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She continued to stare at him, as though he had suddenly begun speaking some distant, unknown dialect of Galactic Standard. Again she said, in half a whisper this time, "Wharf."</p><p>她继续盯着他，仿佛他突然改说某种陌生的、不为人知的银河标准语方言。她又说了一句：“什么？”这回音量近乎耳语。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He continued, stumbling over unfamiliar words that half-embarrassed him. "You must appeal to some great essence, some great spirit, some…… I don't know what to call it."</p><p>他继续结结巴巴地用一些不太熟悉而令自己有几分困窘的词汇说：“你必须求助某种伟大的本体，某种伟大的圣灵，某种……我不知道该叫它什么。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Raindrop Forty-Three said in a voice that rose into higher registers but remained low, "I thought so. I thought that was what you meant, but I couldnt believe it. Youre accusing us of having religion. Why didn't you say so? Why didn't you use the word?"</p><p>雨点四十三将音区提高，但仍将音量压低。“我就知道，我就知道你是那个意思，可是我本来不敢相信。你是在指控我们拥有宗教。你为什么不直接那么说？为什么不直接用那个词汇？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She waited for an answer and Seldon, a little confused at the onslaught, said, "Because thats not a word I use. I call it supernaturalism. "</p><p>她在等待一个答案。谢顿被这轮猛攻弄得有点不知所措，他说：“因为那不是我使用的词汇，我管它叫超自然论。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Call it what you will. Its religion and we don't have it. Religion is for the tribesmen, for the swarming ho……"</p><p>“随便你怎么称呼。反正它就是宗教，而我们没有这种东西。宗教是外族人才有的，是那群渣……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Sister paused to swallow as though she had come near to choking and Seldon was certain the word she had choked over was……"</p><p>这位姐妹突然住口，吞了一下口水，仿佛差点就要呛死。谢顿可以确定，令她呛到的一定是“渣滓”两个字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was in control again. Speaking slowly and somewhat below her normal soprano, she said, "We are not a religious people. Our kingdom is of this Galaxy and always has been. If you have a religion……"</p><p>她再度恢复自制，以低于她平常的女高音音调缓缓说道：“我们不是一个信仰宗教的民族，我们的国度是这个银河系，而且一向如此。如果你信教……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt trapped. Somehow he had not counted on this. He raised a hand defensively. "Not really. Im a mathematician and my kingdom is also of this Galaxy. Its just that I thought, from the rigidity of your customs, that your kingdom……"</p><p>谢顿感到中了圈套，怎么也没料到会有这种发展。他举起一只手，做出辩护的手势。“不是这样的。我是个数学家，我的国度也是这个银河系。只不过我想到，根据你们那些刻板的习俗，你们的国度……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"don't think it, tribesman. If our customs are rigid, it is because we are mere mI'llions surrounded by bI'llions. Somehow we must mark ourselves off so that we precious few are not lost among your swarms and hordes. We must be marked off by our hairlessness, our clothing, our behavior, our way of life. We must know who we are and we must be sure that you tribesmen know who we are. We labor in our farms so that we can make ourselves valuable in your eyes and thus make certain that you leave us alone. Thats all we ask of you…… to leave us alone."</p><p>“外族男子，别那样想。若说我们的习俗刻板，那是因为我们只有几百万人，却被几十亿人包围起来。我们总得设法表现得与众不同，唯有这样，我们这些珍贵的少数，才不会被你们满坑满谷的多数所吞没。我们必须靠我们的脱毛、我们的衣着、我们的行为、我们的生活方式来和他人区隔。我们必须知道自己是什么人，也必须确保你们外族人知道我们是什么人。我们在农场中辛勤工作，好让你们对我们刮目相看，如此才能确保你们放我们一马。这就是我们对你们唯一的要求……放我们一马。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have no intention of harming you or any of your people. I seek only knowledge, here as everywhere."</p><p>“我无意伤害你或是任何族人。我只是来这里寻求知识，就像在其他地方一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So you insult us by asking about our religion, as though we have ever called on a mysterious, insubstantial spirit to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves."</p><p>“你却借着询问我们的宗教来侮辱我们，仿佛我们曾经仰赖一种神秘的、虚无的圣灵，帮助我们做到我们自己做不到的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There are many people, many worlds who believe in supernaturalism in one form or another…… religion, if you like the word better. We may disagree with them in one way or another, but we are as likely to be wrong in our disbelief as they in their belief. In any case, there is no disgrace in such belief and my questions were not intended as insults."</p><p>“有许多人、许多世界都相信某种形式的超自然论……宗教，你喜欢这样说也可以。我们或许因为某种理由而不同意他们的见解，但我们的不信也有可能是个错误，双方的错误几率刚好一半一半。无论如何，这种信仰没什么可耻的，我的问题也并非打算侮辱任何人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But she was not reconciled. "Religion!" she said angrily. "We have no need of it."</p><p>她却没有讲和的意思。“宗教！”她气呼呼地说，“我们根本不需要。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldons spirits, having sunk steadily in the course of this exchange, reached bottom. This whole thing, this expedition with Raindrop Forty-Three, had come to nothing.</p><p>在这段对话进行中，谢顿的心持续往下沉，此时则跌到谷底。这整个行动，这趟和雨点四十三所做的远征，最后竟然一无所获。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But she went on to say, "We have something far better. We have history."</p><p>不料她继续说：“我们另有好得多的东西，我们有历史！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Seldons feelings rebounded at once and he smiled.</p><p>谢顿的心情立刻回升，他随即露出笑容。</p></div>
