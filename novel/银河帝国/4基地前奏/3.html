<div class='layout'><p>3 University</p><p>第3章 大学</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>STREELING UNIVERSITY:……An institution of higher learning in the Streeling Sector of ancient Trantor……Despite all these claims to fame in the fields of the humanities and sciences alike, it is not for those that the University looms large in todays consciousness. It would probably have come as a total surprise to the generations of scholars at the University to know that in later times Streeling University would be most remembered because a certain Hari Seldon, during the period of The Flight, had been in residence there for a short time.</p><p>斯璀璘大学：……位于古川陀斯璀璘区的一所高等学府……虽在人文与科学领域皆颇享盛名，该校名声得以流传至今却并非由于这些成就。若是让该校历任学者知道，斯璀璘大学在后人心目中印象深刻的主要原因，是因为某位名叫哈里·谢顿的人于“逃亡期”曾在那里暂住，他们一定会惊讶不已。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA</p><p>……《银河百科全书》</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hari Seldon remained uncomfortably silent for a while after Hummins quiet statement. He shrank within himself in sudden recognition of his own deficiencies.</p><p>夫铭做出这个沉稳的叙述之后，哈里·谢顿颇不自在地维持了一阵沉默。他突然认清了自己的弱点，这使他羞愧得无地自容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had invented a new science: psychohistory. He had extended the laws of probability in a very subtle manner to take into account new complexities and uncertainties and had ended up with elegant equations in innumerable unknowns.</p><p>他发明了一种崭新的科学：心理史学。他以极其精妙的方式推广几率法则，以便处理新的复杂度与不准性，最后得到一组优美的方程式。这组方程式含有数不清的变数……可能是无穷多，他却无从判断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Possibly an infinite number; he couldnt tell.</p><p>但它只是一种数学游戏，除此之外一无是处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But it was a mathematical game and nothing more. He had psychohistory……or at least the basis of psychohistory but only as a mathematical curiosity. Where was the historical knowledge that could perhaps give some meaning to the empty equations?</p><p>他拥有了心理史学，至少是心理史学的基础，但它只能算个数学珍玩。唯一可能赋予这些空洞方程式一些意义的历史知识，试问又在哪里？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had none. He had never been interested in history. He knew the outline of Heliconian history. Courses in that small fragment of the human story had, of course, been compulsory in the Heliconian schools. But what was there beyond that? Surely what else he had picked up was merely the bare skeletons that everyone gathered……half legend, the other half surely distorted. </p><p>他一窍不通，他对历史向来没有兴趣。他只知道赫利肯历史的大纲，因为在赫利肯的各级学校，这一小部分的人类历史当然是必修课程。可是除此之外呢？他所吸收的其他历史知识，无疑只是人云亦云的皮毛与梗概……一半是传说，另一半显然也遭到扭曲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Still, how could one say that the Galactic Empire was dying? It had existed for ten thousand years as an accepted Empire and even before that, Trantor, as the capital of the dominating kingdom, had held what was a virtual empire for two thousand years. The Empire had survived the early centuries when whole sections of the Galaxy would now and then refuse to accept the end of their local independence. It had survived the vicissitudes that went with the occasional rebellions, the dynastic wars, some serious periods of breakdown. Most worlds had scarcely been troubled by such things and Trantor itself had grown steadily until it was the worldwide human habitation that now called itself the Eternal World.</p><p>话说回来，谁又能说银河帝国即将灭亡呢？它成为举世公认的帝国已有一万年的历史，甚至在此之前，还有二千年的时间，川陀身为雄霸一方的王国之国都，也等于领导了一个帝国。在帝国最初几世纪间，银河各区不时会有扞卫独立地位的活动，而帝国终究安然度过这个瓶颈。至于偶尔发生的叛变、改朝换代的战争，以及一些严重崩溃期所带来的起伏，帝国也都一一克服。大多数世界几乎未曾受到这些问题的困扰，川陀本身也不断稳定成长，最后整个世界都住满人类，如今则骄傲地自称为“永恒世界”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To be sure, in the last four centuries, turmoil had increased somehow and there had been a rash of Imperial assassinations and takeovers. But even that was calming down and right now the Galaxy was as quiet as it had ever been. Under Cleon I and before him under his father, Stanel VI, the worlds were prosperous……and Cleon himself was not considered a tyrant. Even those who disliked the Imperium as an institution rarely had anything truly bad to say about Cleon, much as they might inveigh against Eto Demerzel. </p><p>无可讳言，在过去四个世纪中，动乱似乎有增无减，接连不断出现行刺皇帝与篡位事件。但就连那些动荡也已经渐渐平息，今日的银河又恢复以往的太平岁月。在斯达涅尔五世和克里昂一世这对父子统治之下，所有的世界都欣欣向荣……克里昂本人则从未被视为暴君。即使那些不喜欢帝制的人，虽然常常痛骂伊图·丹莫刺尔，对克里昂也鲜有真正的恶评。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Why, then, should Hummin say that the Galactic Empire was dying……and with such conviction?</p><p>那么，为何夫铭竟然说银河帝国即将灭亡，而且这么斩钉截铁？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin was a journalist. He probably knew Galactic history in some detail and he had to understand the current situation in great detail. Was it this that supplied him with the knowledge that lay behind his statement? In that case, just what was the knowledge?</p><p>夫铭是个新闻记者，他或许对银河历史有些认识，而且必须对当今情势充分了解。是否因为这样，使他有足够的知识作为这个论断的后盾？果真如此，那些知识又是什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Several times Seldon was on the point of asking, of demanding an answer, but there was something in Hummins solemn face that stopped him. And there was something in his own ingrained belief that the Galactic Empire was a given, an axiom, the foundation stone on which all argument rested that prevented him too. After all, if that was wrong, he didn't want to know. </p><p>谢顿好几次想发问，想求得一个答案，但夫铭的严肃表情都使他欲言又止。而阻止他发问的另一个原因，则是他自己有个根深蒂固的想法，认为银河帝国是一个前提、一个公设，以及所有论证的基石。毕竟，即使“它”是错的，自己也不愿知道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>No, he couldnt believe that he was wrong. The Galactic Empire could no more come to an end than the Universe itself could. Or, if the Universe did end, then……and only then……would the Empire end.</p><p>不，他不能相信自己错了。银河帝国就像宇宙一样永远不会毁灭。或者应该说，假若有一天宇宙真毁灭了，唯有在那种情况下，帝国才会跟着陪葬。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon closed his eyes, attempting to sleep but, of course, he could not. Would he have to study the history of the Universe in order to advance his theory of psychohistory?</p><p>谢顿闭上眼睛，试图小睡片刻，可是当然无法入眠。难道为了发展他的心理史学理论，他得研究整个宇宙的历史吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How could he? Twenty-five million worlds existed, each with its own endlessly complex history. How could he study all that? There were book-films in many volumes, he knew, that dealt with Galactic history. He had even skimmed one once for some now-forgotten reason and had found it too dull to view even halfway through.</p><p>他怎么办得到呢？二千五百万个世界，每个都有自己无限复杂的历史，他怎么研究得完？他知道，讨论银河历史的影视书汗牛充栋。他甚至曾经浏览过其中一本，原因他自己也忘了，结果发现内容太过沉闷，连一半也无法读完。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The book-films had dealt with important worlds. With some, it dealt through all or almost all their history; with others, only as they gained importance for a time and only till they faded away. He remembered having looked up Helicon in the index and having found only one citation. He had punched the keys that would turn up that citation and found Helicon included in a listing of worlds which, on one occasion, had temporarily lined up behind a certain claimant to the Imperial throne who had failed to make good his claim. Helicon had escaped retribution on that occasion, probably because it was not even sufficiently important to be punished.</p><p>那些影视书讨论的都是重要的世界。某些世界的历史全部或几乎全有记载，某些则只有它们兴起与没落之间的历史。他记得曾在索引中查过赫利肯，发现只有一处提到。于是他按下几个键，查看那一部分的内容，结果看到赫利肯和其他一些世界并列在一张清单上。原来在某段短暂的时期，那些世界曾支持一个声称拥有皇位继承权的人，不过那人最后并未成功。但赫利肯未曾遭到惩处，或许是因为它太过微不足道，连受罚的资格都没有。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What good was such a history? Surely, psychohistory would have to take into account the actions and reactions and interactions of each world……each and every world. How could one study the history of twenty-five million worlds and consider all their possible interactions? It would surely be an impossible task and this was just one more reinforcement of the general conclusion that psychohistory was of theoretical interest but could never be put to any practical use. </p><p>这种历史又有什么用呢？不用说，心理史学必须考虑到每个世界的行动与反应，以及彼此间的互动……大大小小每一个世界。谁又能研究二千五百万个世界的历史，并考虑其间各种可能的互动关系呢？那无疑是个不可能的任务，而这更强化了谢顿的结论：心理史学只有理论上的价值，但绝对不会有任何实用性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon felt a gentle push forward and decided that the air-taxi must be decelerating.</p><p>此时，谢顿感受到一股向前的微弱推力，判断一定是出租飞车开始减速。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whats up?" he asked.</p><p>“怎么了？”他问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think weve come far enough," said Hummin, "to risk a small stopover for a bite to eat, a glass of something or other, and a visit to a washroom."</p><p>“我想我们走得够远了，”夫铭说，“不妨冒险稍作停留，吃几口东西，喝点什么，同时上个洗手间。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And, in the course of the next fifteen minutes, during which the air-taxi slowed steadily, they came to a lighted recess. The taxi swerved inward and found a parking spot among five or six other vehicles.</p><p>接下来的十五分钟，出租飞车平稳地逐渐减速，最后来到一处灯火通明的壁凹。飞车立刻转进去，在五六辆车子之间找到一个停车位。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummins practiced eye seemed to take in the recess, the other taxis, the diner, the walkways, and the men and women all at a glance. Seldon, trying to look inconspicuous and again not knowing how, watched him, trying not to do so too intently.</p><p>夫铭那双老练的眼睛似乎只瞥了一眼，便将整个壁凹的环境、其他出租车辆、进餐的民众、一条条人行道，以及附近的男男女女都一览无遗。谢顿望着他，一心想要显得毫不起眼，却仍然不知道该怎么做，只好尽量不表现得太过专注。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When they sat down at a small table and punched in their orders, Seldon, attempting to sound indifferent, said, "Everything okay?"</p><p>等到他们在一张小桌旁坐下来，按下点菜键之后，谢顿试着以不在乎的口气说：“一切都还好吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Seems so," said Hummin.</p><p>“似乎如此。”夫铭说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How can you tell?"</p><p>“你又怎么知道？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin let his dark eyes rest on Seldon for a moment. "Instinct," he said. "Years of news gathering. You look and know, No news here. "</p><p>夫铭用一双黑眼珠瞪了谢顿一会儿。“直觉，”他说，“跑了许多年新闻，只消看一眼，就知道‘这里没新闻’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon nodded and felt relieved. Hummin might have said it sardonically, but there must be a certain amount of truth to it. </p><p>谢顿点了点头，感到如释重负。夫铭的说法或许纯属讥嘲，可是一定多少有些真实性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His satisfaction did not last through the first bite of his sandwich. He looked up at Hummin with his mouth full and with a look of hurt surprise on his face.</p><p>这种心满意足并未持续多久，在他咬下第一口三明治时便告结束。他抬起头望向夫铭，满嘴无法下咽的食物，脸上带着惊愕的表情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "This is a wayside diner, my friend. Cheap, fast, and not very good. The foods homegrown and has an infusion of rather sharp yeast. Trantorian palates are used to it."</p><p>夫铭说：“朋友，这是路边速食店。便宜、快速，而且不怎么可口。这些食物都是土产，还加了气味强烈的酵母。川陀人的嘴巴习惯这种口味。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon swallowed with difficulty. "But back in the hotel……"</p><p>谢顿硬着头皮吞下去。“可是在旅馆……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You were in the Imperial Sector, Seldon. Food is imported there and where microfood is used it is high-quality. It is also expensive."</p><p>“谢顿，那时你在皇区。那里的食物是进口的，使用的微生食品都是高级货，而且那些食物非常昂贵。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon wondered whether to take another bite. "You mean that as long as I stay on Trantor……"</p><p>谢顿不知道该不该再咬一口。“你的意思是，只要我待在川陀……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin made a hushing motion with his lips. "Dont give anyone the impression that youre used to better. There are places on Trantor where to be identified as an aristocrat is worse than being identified as an Outworlder. The food wont be so bad everywhere, I assure you. These wayside places have a reputation for low quality. If you can stomach that sandwich, youll be able to eat anywhere on Trantor. And it wont hurt you. Its not decayed or bad or anything like that. It just has a harsh, strong taste and, honestly, you may grow accustomed to it. Ive met Trantorians who spit out honest food and say it lacks that homegrown tang."</p><p>夫铭用嘴唇做了一个禁声的动作。“别让任何人觉得你养尊处优。在川陀某些地方，你被误认为贵族还不如被认出是外星人士。我向你保证，不是每个地方的食物都这么难吃。这些路边摊一向以品质低劣闻名，你只要咽得下这些三明治，就能吃遍川陀任何角落的东西。何况它对你没有害处，它并未腐烂、变坏或发生其他变化，只不过有一种刺激而强烈的口味。而且老实说，你会慢慢习惯的。我曾经遇到一些川陀人，他们对纯正食物不屑一顾，认为缺乏土产的特有风味。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do they grow much food on Trantor?" asked Seldon. A quick side glance showed him there was no one seated in the immediate vicinity and he spoke quietly. "Ive always heard it takes twenty surrounding worlds to supply the hundreds of freight ships required to feed Trantor every day."</p><p>“川陀生产的食物很多吗？”谢顿问道。他向左右迅速瞄一眼，确定附近都没有坐人，这才轻声地说：“我总是听说每天有数百艘太空货船为川陀运送粮食，而这些粮食需要周围二十个世界共同供应。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know. And hundreds to carry off the load of wastes. And if you want to make the story really good, you say that the same freight ships carry food one way and waste the other. Its true that we import considerable quantities of food, but thats mostly luxury items. And we export considerable waste, carefully treated into inoffensiveness, as important organic fertilizer……every bit as important to other worlds as the food is to us. But thats only a small fraction of the whole."</p><p>“我知道，此外还需要数百艘把垃圾运走。你若想让这个故事听来真正精彩，就该说同一艘货船来程载送粮食，回程则载走一堆垃圾。我们进口大量食物是真有其事，但那些大多是奢侈品。我们也的确出口可观的垃圾，它们都经过仔细处理，对人体不再有害，反而是一种重要的有机肥料。那些垃圾对其他世界而言，就像食物对我们一样重要。可是，那只不过是一小部分而已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is?"</p><p>“是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. In addition to fish in the sea, there are gardens and truck farms everywhere. And fruit trees and poultry and rabbits and vast microorganism farms……usually called yeast farms, though the yeast makes up a minority of the growths. And our wastes are mostly used right here at home to maintain all that growth. In fact, in many ways Trantor is very much like an enormous and overgrown space settlement. Have you ever visited one of those?"</p><p>“是的。川陀除了海里的渔产，各地还有菜园和蔬菜农场。此外更有果树园、家禽、兔子，以及庞大的微生农场……通常称为酵母农场，不过酵母只占作物总量的少数。我们的垃圾主要用在本地，用来维持作物生长所需。事实上在许多方面，川陀都非常像一座巨大而人口过多的太空殖民地。你去过太空殖民地吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Indeed I have."</p><p>“我的确去过。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Space settlements are essentially enclosed cities, with everything artificially cycled, with artificial ventilation, artificial day and night, and so on. Trantor is different only in that even the largest space settlement has a population of only ten million and Trantor has four thousand times that. Of course, we have real gravity. And no space settlement can match us in our microfoods. We have yeast vats, fungal vats, and algae ponds vast beyond the imagination. And we are strong on artificial flavoring, added with no light hand. Thats what gives the taste to what youre eating."</p><p>“太空殖民地基本上就是密封的城市，万事万物都靠人工循环，例如人工通风、人工昼夜等等。川陀不同之处仅在于人口，即使最大的太空殖民地，人口也只有一千万，川陀的人口却是它的四千倍。当然，我们还有真正的重力，而且任何太空殖民地的微生食品都不能和我们相比。我们有大到无法想象的酵母培养桶、真菌培养垫和藻类培养池。此外我们精于人工香料，添加时绝无保留。你吃到的那种特殊口味便是这么来的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon had gotten through most of his sandwich and found it not as offensive as the first bite had been. "And it wont affect me?"</p><p>谢顿已经差不多解决了那份三明治，发觉它不再像第一口那么难吃。“它不会害我生病吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It does hit the intestinal flora and every once in a while it afflicts some poor Outworlder with diarrhea, but thats rare, and you harden even to that quickly. Still, drink your milkshake, which you probably wont like. It contains an antidiarrhetic that should keep you safe, even if you tend to be sensitive to such things."</p><p>“它的确会伤到肠内微生物，偶尔也会害得一些可怜的外星人士腹泻，不过那些情况都很罕见，而且即使如此，你也很快就会有抵抗力。话说回来，还是喝掉你的奶昔吧，虽然你也许同样不喜欢。它含有止泻成分，即使你对这些东西容易过敏，它也应该能保你安然无恙。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said querulously, "Dont talk about it, Hummin. A person can be suggestible to such things."</p><p>谢顿抱怨地说：“别再讲了，夫铭，这种事容易受到暗示。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Finish the milkshake and forget the suggestibility."</p><p>“喝完你的奶昔，忘掉这些暗示吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They finished the rest of their meal in silence and soon were on their way again.</p><p>他们默默地吃完剩下的食物，不久便再度上路。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They were now racing rapidly through the tunnel once more. Seldon decided to give voice to the question that had been nagging at him for the last hour or so.</p><p>他们又开始在隧道中风驰电掣。那个在心中鼓噪了约有一小时的问题，谢顿决定让它化为真正的声音。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why do you say the Galactic Empire is dying?"</p><p>“你为什么说银河帝国即将灭亡？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin turned to look at Seldon again. "As a journalist, I have statistics poured into me from all sides till theyre squeezing out of my ears. And Im allowed to publish very little of it. Trantors population is decreasing. Twenty-five years ago, it stood at almost forty-five billion. </p><p>夫铭再度转头望向谢顿。“身为新闻记者，各种统计资料从四面八方向我涌来，直到溢出我的耳朵为止。而我获准能发表的，只有极少一部分。川陀的人口正在锐减，二十五年前，它几乎有四百五十亿人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Partly, this decrease is because of a decline in the birthrate. To be sure, Trantor never has had a high birthrate. If youll look about you when youre traveling on Trantor, you wont encounter very many children, considering the enormous population. But just the same its declining. Then too there is emigration. People are leaving Trantor in greater numbers than are arriving.</p><p>“这种现象，部分是由于出生率的降低。事实上，川陀的出生率一向不高。当你在川陀四处旅行时，只要稍加注意，便会发现街上没有太多儿童，和庞大的人口简直不成比例。但即使不考虑这一点，人口仍旧逐年锐减。此外还有移民的因素，移出川陀的人口比移入的多得多。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Considering its large population," said Seldon, "thats not surprising."</p><p>“既然它有如此庞大的人口，”谢顿说，“这也就不足为奇。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But its unusual just the same because it hasnt happened before. Again, all over the Galaxy trade is stagnating. People think that because there are no rebellions at the moment and because things are quiet that all is well and that the difficulties of the past few centuries are over. However, political infighting, rebellions, and unrest are all signs of a certain vitality too. But now theres a general weariness. Its quiet, not because people are satisfied and prosperous, but because theyre tired and have given up."</p><p>“但这仍是不寻常的现象，因为以前从未发生过这种事。再者，整个银河系的贸易都呈现停滞。人们认为这是由于目前没有任何叛乱，因为一切都很平静，天下太平了，数世纪的困苦都已成为过去。然而，政治斗争、叛乱活动以及不安的局势，其实也都是某种活力的象征。如今却是一种全面性的疲乏状态。表面上的确平静，但这并非由于人们真正满足，或是社会真正繁荣，而是因为他们已经疲倦了，死心了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, I don't know," said Seldon dubiously.</p><p>“喔，我并不清楚。”谢顿以怀疑的口吻说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I do. And the antigrav phenomenon weve talked about is another case in point. We have a few gravitic lifts in operation, but new ones aren't being constructed. Its an unprofitable venture and there seems no interest in trying to make it profitable. The rate of technological advance has been slowing for centuries and is down to a crawl now. In some cases, it has stopped altogether. isn't  this something youve noticed? After all, youre a mathematician."</p><p>“我很清楚。我们刚才谈到的反重力设施，就是另一个贴切的例子。我们目前有几座运作中的重力升降机，可是并没有再造新的。它是一种无利可图的投资，而且似乎谁也懒得试图让它转亏为盈。数个世纪以来，科技进展的速率不断减缓，如今则已有如牛步。在某些方面，则是完全不再进步。你难道都没注意到这种事吗？毕竟你是个数学家。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I cant say Ive given the matter any thought."</p><p>“我不敢说我思考过这个问题。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No one does. Its accepted. Scientists are very good these days at saying that things are impossible, impractical, useless. They condemn any speculation at once. You, for instance……What do you think of psychohistory? It is theoretically interesting, but it is useless in any practical sense. Am I right?"</p><p>“没有人思考过，大家都视为理所当然。这年头的科学家，动不动就喜欢说这个不可能，那个不实用或没有用。对于深刻的反省，他们总是立刻加以否定。就拿你作例子，你对心理史学抱持什么看法？它有理论上的价值，却没有任何实用性。我说得对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes and no," said Seldon, annoyed. "It is useless in any practical sense, but not because my sense of adventure has decayed, I assure you. It really it useless."</p><p>“也对也不对。”谢顿以厌烦的口气答道，“就实用性而言，它的确没有用，但我向你保证，这并非由于我的冒险犯难精神式微了。事实上，它的的确确没有用。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That, at least," said Hummin with a trace of sarcasm, "is your impression in this atmosphere of decay in which all the Empire lives."</p><p>“至少这一点，”夫铭带着几分讥嘲说，“是你身处帝国整体的衰败气氛下所产生的印象。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This atmosphere of decay," said Seldon angrily, "is your impression. Is it possible that you are wrong?"</p><p>“这种衰败的气氛，”谢顿气呼呼地说，“则是你自己的印象。有没有可能是你弄错了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin stopped and for a moment appeared thoughtful. Then he said, "Yes, I might be wrong. I am speaking only from intuition, from guesses. What I need is a working technique of psychohistory."</p><p>夫铭并未立刻回答，看来陷入了沉思。一会儿之后，他才说：“是的，我有可能弄错。我只是根据直觉、根据猜测来下断语。我需要的是心理史学这种实用的科技。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shrugged and did not take the bait. He said, "I don't have such a technique to give you……But suppose youre right. Suppose the Empire it running down and will eventually stop and fall apart. The human species will still exist."</p><p>谢顿耸了耸肩，并未吞下这个饵。他说：“我没有这样的科技能提供给你。但假设你是对的，假设帝国的确在走下坡，最后终将消失，变得四分五裂，可是全体人类仍将存在。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Under what conditions, man? For nearly twelve thousand years, Trantor, under strong rulers, has largely kept the peace. Thereve been interruptions to that……rebellions, localized civil wars, tragedy in plenty……but, on the whole and over large areas, there has been peace. Why is Helicon so pro-Imperium? Your world, I mean. Because it is small and would be devoured by its neighbors were it not that the Empire keeps it secure."</p><p>“老兄，在什么情形下存在？近一万两千年来，在强势领导者统治之下，川陀大致能维持一个和平局面。过去也有过一些动荡……叛变、局部的内战，以及众多的天灾人祸……但就整体而言，就大尺度而言，天下仍然算是太平。为什么赫利肯如此拥护帝政？我是指你的世界。因为它很小，要不是帝国维护它的安全，邻近世界就会吞掉它。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you predicting universal war and anarchy if the Empire fails?"</p><p>“你是预言万一帝国崩溃，会出现全面性的战争和无政府状态？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course. Im not fond of the Emperor oooof the Imperial institutions in general, but I don't have any substitute for it. I don't know what else will keep the peace and Im not ready to let go until I have something else in hand."</p><p>“当然。整体而言，我并不喜欢这位皇帝和这种帝制，可是我没有任何取代方案。我不知道还有什么方式能维系和平，而在我掌握其他方案之前，我还不准备放手。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon said, "You talk as though you are in control of the Galaxy. You are not ready to let go? You must have something else in hand? Who are you to talk so?"</p><p>谢顿道：“你这样说，好像银河系掌握在你手里。你还不准备放手？你必须掌握其他方案？你以为自己是什么人？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im speaking generally, figuratively," said Hummin. "Im not worried about Chetter Hummin personally. It might be said that the Empire will last my time; it might even show signs of improvement in my time. Declines don't follow a straight-line path. It may be a thousand years before the final crash and you might well imagine I would be dead then and, certainly, I will leave no descendants. As far as women are concerned, I have nothing but the occasional casual attachment and I have no children and intend to have none. I have given no hostages to fortune……I looked you up after your talk, Seldon. You have no children either."</p><p>“我这是一般性、比喻性的说法。”夫铭说，“我并不担心契特·夫铭这个人。也许可以断言，帝国在我死后仍将继续存在；而且在我有生之年，它甚至可能显现进步的迹象。衰微并非沿着一条直线前进，或许还要上千年的时间，帝国才会完全瓦解。你一定可以想象，那时我早就死了，而且，我当然不会留下子嗣。对于女人，我只是偶尔动动情，我没有子女，将来也不想要。所以说，我对未来毫无个人的牵挂……在你演讲之后，我调查过你，谢顿，你也没有任何子女。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have parents and two brothers, but no children." He smiled rather weakly. "I was very attached to a woman at one time, but it seemed to her that I was attached more to my mathematics."</p><p>“我双亲俱在，有两个兄弟，但没有小孩。”他露出相当无力的笑容，“我曾经十分迷恋一名女子，但她觉得我对数学的迷恋更深。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Were you?"</p><p>“是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It didn't seem so to me, but it seemed so to her. So she left."</p><p>“我自己不觉得，可是她这么想，所以她离开了我。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you have had no one since?"</p><p>“从此你就再也没有其他女伴？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. I remember the pain too clearly as yet."</p><p>“没有，那种痛苦至今仍旧刻骨铭心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well then, it might seem we could both wait out the matter and leave it to other people, well after our time, to suffer. I might have been willing to accept that earlier, but no longer. For now I have a tool; I am in command."</p><p>“这么说，似乎我们两人都能袖手旁观，把这个问题留给几百年后的人去烦恼。以前我或许愿意这么做，如今却不会。因为现在我已经有了工具，我已经能控制局面了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Whats your tool?" asked Seldon, already knowing the answer.</p><p>“你有什么工具？”谢顿明知故问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You!" said Hummin.</p><p>“你！”夫铭说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And because Seldon had known what Hummin would say, he wasted no time in being shocked or astonished. He simply shook his head and said, "You are quite wrong. I am no tool fit for use."</p><p>谢顿早就料到夫铭会这么说，因此他并未震惊，也没有被吓倒。他只是立刻摇了摇头，答道：“你错得太离谱了，我不是什么合适的工具。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?"</p><p>“为何不是？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon sighed. "How often must I repeat it? Psychohistory is not a practical study. The difficulty is fundamental. All the space and time of the Universe would not suffice to work out the necessary problems."</p><p>谢顿叹了一口气。“要我重复多少次？心理史学并非一门实用的学问。困难是十分基本的，全宇宙的时空也不足以解决那些难题。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you certain of that?"</p><p>“你确定吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Unfortunately, yes."</p><p>“很遗憾，正是如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Theres no question of your working out the entire future of the Galactic Empire, you know. You neednt trace out in detail the workings of every human being or even of every world. There are merely terrain questions you must answer: Will the Galactic Empire crash and, if so, when? What will be the condition of humanity afterward? Can anything be done to prevent the crash or to ameliorate conditions afterward? These are comparatively simple questions, it seems to me."</p><p>“你可知道，你根本不必推出银河帝国整个的未来。你不需要追踪每一个人类，甚至每一个世界的活动细节也不必。你必须回答的只有几个问题：银河帝国是否真会瓦解？答案若是肯定的，那么何时会发生？之后人类的处境如何？有没有任何措施能够防止帝国瓦解，或是改善之后的处境？相较之下，这些都是相当简单的问题，至少我这么觉得。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head and smiled sadly. "The history of mathematics is full of simple questions that had only the most complicated of answers……or none at all."</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头，露出一抹苦笑。“数学史中有无数简单的问题，它们的答案却再复杂不过……或者根本没有答案。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is there nothing to be done? I can see that the Empire is falling, but I cant prove it. All my conclusions are subjective and I cannot show that I am not mistaken. Because the view is a seriously unsettling one, people would prefer not to believe my subjective conclusion and nothing will be done to prevent the Fall or even to cushion it. You could prove the coming Fall or, for that matter, disprove it."</p><p>“真的束手无策吗？我能看出帝国江河日下，但我无法证实这一点。我的一切结论都是主观的，我不能证明其中没有错误。由于这种看法令人极度不安，人们宁可不相信我的主观结论。因此不会有任何救亡图存的行动，甚至不会试图减轻它的冲击。而你却能证明即将来临的衰亡，或证明那是不可能的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But that is exactly what I cannot do. I cant find you proof where none exists. I cant make a mathematical system practical when it isn't . I cant find you two even numbers that will yield an odd number as a sum, no matter how vitally your all the Galaxy……may need that odd number."</p><p>“但这正是我无法做到的，我不能帮你找到不存在的证明。一个不切实际的数学系统，我没办法让它变得实用。正如我不能帮你找到加起来是奇数的两个偶数，不论你……或整个银河系……多么需要那个奇数。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "Well then, youre part of the decay. Youre ready to accept failure."</p><p>夫铭道：“这么说的话，你也成了衰败的一环。你已经准备接受失败。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What choice have I?"</p><p>“我有什么选择？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Cant you try? However useless the effort may seem to you to be, have you anything better to do with your life? Have you some worthier goal? Have you a purpose that will justify you in your own eyes to some greater extent?" </p><p>“难道你就不能试一试？无论这个努力在你看来多么徒劳无功，你这一生还能有什么更好的计划？还能有什么更崇高的目标？在你自己眼中，你还有什么更加值得全力以赴的伟大理想？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldons eyes blinked rapidly. "Millions of worlds. Billions of cultures. Quadrillions of people. Decillions of interrelationships……And you want me to reduce it to order."</p><p>谢顿的眼睛迅速眨了几下。“上千万个世界，数十亿个文化，好几万兆的人口，恒河沙数的互动关系……你竟要我化约成秩序。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, I want you to try. For the sake of those millions of worlds, billions of cultures, and quadrillions of people. Not for the Emperor. Not for Demerzel. For humanity."</p><p>“不，我只要你试试看，就为了这上千万个世界，数十亿个文化，以及好几万兆的人口。并非为了大帝，也不是为丹莫刺尔，而是为了全体人类。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I will fail," said Seldon.</p><p>“我会失败的。”谢顿说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then we will be no worse off. Will you try?"</p><p>“那我们也不会比现在更糟。你愿意试试吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And against his will and not knowing why, Seldon heard himself say, "I will try." And the course of his life was set.</p><p>不知道为什么，谢顿竟然听见自己说出违心的一句：“我愿意试试。”他一生的方向也因此确定了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The journey came to its end and the air-taxi moved into a much larger lot than the one at which they had eaten. (Seldon still remembered the taste of the sandwich and made a wry face.)</p><p>这趟旅程终于结束，出租飞车驶进一处停车场，这里比他们中途休息的地方要大得多。谢顿仍然记得那个三明治的味道，不禁露出一副愁眉苦脸。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin turned in his taxi and came back, placing his credit slip in a small pocket on the inner surface of his shirt. He said, "Youre completely safe here from anything outright and open. This is the Streeling Sector."</p><p>前去归还飞车的夫铭走了回来，顺手将他的信用瓷卡塞进衬衣内层的小口袋。他说：“面对任何公然和公开的活动，你在此地都绝对安全无虞。这里是斯璀璘区。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Streeling?"</p><p>“斯璀璘？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Its named for someone who first opened up the area to settlement, I imagine. Most of the sectors are named for someone or other, which means that most of the names are ugly and some are hard to pronounce. Just the same, if you try to have the inhabitants here change Streeling to Sweetsmell or something like that, youll have a fight on your hands."</p><p>“我猜，它是根据首先将本区开拓为殖民地的人命名的。大多数行政区都以某人的名字命名，这就表示大多的区名都很难听，而且有些还很难念。话说回来，你若想让此地居民把斯璀璘区改成香甜区，或是类似这样的名字，那你就是自找麻烦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course," said Seldon, sniffing loudly, "it isn't  exactly Sweetsmell."</p><p>“当然，”谢顿一面说，一面使劲吸气，“这里并非又香又甜。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hardly anywhere in Trantor is, but youll get used to it."</p><p>“整个川陀几乎都是如此，不过你会渐渐习惯的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im glad were here," said Seldon. "Not that I like it, but I got quite tired sitting in the taxi. Getting around Trantor must be a horror. Back on Helicon, we can get from any one place to any other by air, in far less time than it took us to travel less than two thousand kilometers here."</p><p>“真高兴我们到了。”谢顿说，“不是我喜欢这里，而是那辆飞车让我坐得好累。在川陀来来往往一定是个可怕的经验。不像在我们赫利肯，从某处到另一处总有空路可走，即使走得再远，也比我们刚才不到两千公里的路程还省许多时间。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We have air-jets too."</p><p>“我们也有喷射机。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But in that case……"</p><p>“可是既然这样……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I could arrange an air-taxi ride more or less anonymously. It would have been much more difficult with an air-jet. And regardless of how safe it is here, Id feel better if Demerzel didn't know exactly where you were……As a matter of fact, were not done yet. Were going to take the Expressway for the final stage."</p><p>“我可以用几乎匿名的方式安排出租飞车，但是安排喷射机则困难许多。而且不论此地多么安全，能不让丹莫刺尔知道你的确实行踪，我总会比较放心。事实上，这趟旅程并未结束，最后我们还得搭一段捷运。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon knew the expression. "One of those open monorails moving on an electromagnetic field, right?"</p><p>谢顿懂得这个名称。“一种在电磁场上运行的开放式单轨列车，对不对？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Right."</p><p>“没错。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We don't have them on Helicon. Actually, we don't need them there. I rode on an Expressway the first day I was on Trantor. It took me from the airport to the hotel. It was rather a novelty, but if I were to use it all the time, I imagine the noise and crowds would become overpowering."</p><p>“赫利肯没有这种交通工具。其实，是我们那里并不需要。我来川陀的第一天，就曾经搭过一次捷运，从飞航站前往旅馆。感觉相当新奇，但若是天天都得搭，我想噪音和拥挤会变得无法忍受。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin looked amused. "Did you get lost?"</p><p>夫铭看来觉得挺有趣。“你迷路了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, the signs were useful. There was trouble getting on and off, but I was helped. Everyone could tell I was an Outworlder by my clothes, I now realize. They seemed eager to help, though; I guess because it was amusing to watching me hesitate and stumble."</p><p>“没有，那些路标很管用。上下车有点麻烦，不过都有人帮助我。现在我了解了，大家都能从我的服装看出我是外星人士。不过他们似乎都很热心，我猜是因为看到我迟疑和蹒跚的模样很好笑。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"As an expert in Expressway travel by now, you will neither hesitate nor stumble." Hummin said it pleasantly enough, though there was a slight twitch to the corners of his mouth. "Come on, then."</p><p>“如今身为一名捷运旅行专家，你既不会迟疑，也不会再蹒跚了。”夫铭以相当愉悦的口气说，不过嘴角却微微抽动。“我们走吧。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They sauntered leisurely along the walkway, which was lit to the extent one might expect of an overcast day and that brightened now and then as though the sun occasionally broke through the clouds. Automatically, Seldon looked upward to see if that were indeed the case, but the "sky" above was blankly luminous. </p><p>他们沿着人行道悠闲地漫步，沿途的照明让人感到是个阴天。光线偶尔会忽然变亮，仿佛太阳不时从云缝中钻出来。谢顿自然而然抬起头，想看看是否果真如此，但头顶的“天空”却是一团空洞的光明。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin saw this and said, "This change in brightness seems too suit the human psyche. There are days when the street seems to be in bright sunlight and days when it is rather darker than it is now."</p><p>夫铭将一切看在眼里，于是说：“这样的亮度变化似乎符合人类心理状态。有些日子街道上好像艳阳高照，也有些日子比现在还要暗。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But no rain or snow?"</p><p>“但没有雨雪吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Or hail or sleet. No. Nor high humidity nor bitter cold. Trantor has its points, Seldon, even now."</p><p>“或是冰雹、冰珠？全都没有。此外，也没有过高的湿度或刺骨的寒冷。即使是现在，谢顿，川陀仍有它的优点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were people walking in both directions and there were a considerable number of young people and also some children accompanying the adults, despite what Hummin had said about the birthrate. All seemed reasonably prosperous and reputable. The two sexes were equally represented and the clothing was distinctly more subdued than it had been in the Imperial Sector. His own costume, as chosen by Hummin, fit right in. Very few were wearing hats and Seldon thankfully removed his own and swung it at his side. </p><p>路上的行人有来有往，其中不少是年轻人，还有些成年人带着小孩……虽然夫铭曾说此地出生率很低。所有的人似乎都意气风发、有头有脸。两性的人数差不多相等，而众人的衣着显然比皇区朴素许多，因此夫铭帮谢顿选的服装刚好合适。戴帽子的人非常少，谢顿乐得摘下自己的帽子挂在腰侧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was no deep abyss separating the two sides of the walkway and as Hummin had predicted in the Imperial Sector, they were walking at what seemed to be ground level. There were no vehicles either and Seldon pointed this out to Hummin.</p><p>左右两条人行道之间不再是无底洞般的深渊，正如夫铭在皇区所预言的，他们似乎是在地面的高度行走。此外路上也见不到任何车辆，谢顿特别向夫铭指出这一点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "There are quite a number of them in the Imperial Sector because theyre used by officials. Elsewhere, private vehicles are rare and those that are used have separate tunnels reserved for them. Their use is not really necessary, since we have Expressways and, for shorter distances, moving corridors. For still shorter distances, we have walkways and we can use our legs."</p><p>夫铭说：“皇区有相当多的车辆，因为那是官员的交通工具。在其他地方，私人车辆十分罕见，而且都有专用的个别隧道。车辆并非真有必要，因为我们拥有捷运。至于较短的距离，我们则有活动回廊；至于更短的距离，我们还有人行道，可以让我们施展双腿。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon heard occasional muted sighs and creaks and saw, some distance off, the endless passing of Expressway cars.</p><p>谢顿听到不时传来一些闷响与嘎嘎声，又看见不远处有许多捷运车厢不停穿梭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There it is," he said, pointing.</p><p>“在那里。”他一面说，一面指了指。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I know, but let us move on to a boarding station. There are more cars there and it is easier to get on."</p><p>“我知道，不过我们还是到专用车站吧。那里车比较多，也比较容易上车。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once they were safely ensconced in an Expressway car, Seldon turned to Hummin and said, "What amazes me is how quiet the Expressways are. I realize that they are mass-propelled by an electromagnetic field, but it seems quiet even for that." He listened to the occasional metallic groan as the car they were on shifted against its neighbors.</p><p>等到他们安坐在捷运车厢内，谢顿便转头对夫铭说：“令我讶异的是捷运竟然这么安静。我知道它是靠电磁场推进，但即便如此，似乎还是太安静了。”他仔细倾听两两车厢之间偶尔擦出的低沉噪音。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, its a marvelous network," said Hummin, "but you don't see it at its peak. When I was younger, it was quieter than it is now and there are those who say that there wasn't as much as a whisper fifty years ago……though I suppose we might make allowance for the idealization of nostalgia."</p><p>“是啊，这是个不同凡响的交通网。”夫铭说，“可是你没见过它的巅峰期，当我较年轻的时候，它比现在更安静。甚至有人说，五十年前几乎一点声音也没有……不过我想，我们该考虑到怀旧心态所造成的夸大。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why isn't  it that way now?"</p><p>“现在为何不是那样？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Because it isn't  maintained properly. I told you about decay."</p><p>“因为缺乏适当的维修。我跟你提到过衰败的趋势。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon frowned. "Surely, people don't sit around and say, Were decaying. Lets let the Expressways fall apart. "</p><p>谢顿皱了皱眉头。“无论如何，人们总不会坐视不理，只会说，‘我们正在衰败，我们就让捷运四分五裂吧。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, they dont. Its not a purposeful thing. Bad spots are patched, decrepit coaches refurbished, magnets replaced. However, its done in more slapdash fashion, more carelessly, and at greater intervals. There just aren't enough credits available."</p><p>“不，他们没有那样做，这并非有意造成的。损坏的地方修补过，老旧的车厢更新过，而磁体也曾经更换过。然而，这些工作做得太过草率、太过大意，而且时间间隔太长。这都是因为没有足够的信用点。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where have the credits gone?"</p><p>“信用点到哪儿去了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Into other things. Weve had centuries of unrest. The navy is much larger and many times more expensive than it once was. The armed forces are much better-paid, in order to keep them quiet. Unrest, revolts, and minor blazes of civil war all take their toll."</p><p>“用到别的地方去了。我们经历了数世纪的动荡，如今舰队编制比过去庞大得多，经费则是过去的好几倍。武装部队的待遇过分优渥，这样才能安抚他们。动荡、叛乱，以及小型的内战烽火，都需要大笔费用才能摆平。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But its been quiet under Cleon. And weve had fifty years of peace."</p><p>“可是在克里昂统治之下，世局一向很平静。而且，我们前后已有五十年的和平。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but soldiers who are well-paid would resent having that pay reduced just because there is peace. Admirals resist mothballing ships and having themselves reduced in rank simply because there is less for them to do. So the credits still go……unproductively……to the armed forces and vital areas of the social good are allowed to deteriorate. Thats what I call decay. don't you? don't you think that eventually you would fit that sort of view into your psychohistorical notions?"</p><p>“没错，不过原本待遇优渥的战士，倘若只是因为天下太平而遭到减薪，心中一定忿忿不平。舰队司令则拒绝只因为不再有那么多任务而遭到降级，或是将他们的星舰编为后备舰队。因此信用点继续流失，流到不事生产的武装部队手里，任由攸关国计民生的领域日益恶化。这就是我所谓的衰败，你不同意吗？难道你不认为，最后你会把这个观点融入心理史学概念中？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon stirred uneasily. Then he said, "Where are we going, by the way?"</p><p>谢顿不安地挪动一下，然后说：“对了，我们要到哪里去？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Streeling University."</p><p>“斯璀璘大学。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah, thats why the sectors name was familiar. Ive heard of the University."</p><p>“啊，难怪本区的名字那么耳熟，我听说过那所大学。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im not surprised. Trantor has nearly a hundred thousand institutions of higher learning and Streeling is one of the thousand or so at the top of the heap."</p><p>“我并不惊讶。川陀拥有将近十万所高等教育机构，而斯璀璘大学属于排名最前面的一千多所。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Will I be staying there?"</p><p>“我要待在那里吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For a while. University campuses are unbreathable sanctuaries, by and large. You will be safe there."</p><p>“要待一阵子。大体而言，大学校园是不可侵犯的神圣殿堂，你在那里会很安全。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But will I be welcome there?"</p><p>“可是我会受欢迎吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not? Its hard to find a good mathematician these days. They might be able to use you. And you might be able to use them too……and for more than just a hiding place."</p><p>“为何不会？这年头很难找到一位优秀的数学家。他们或许能善用你，而你或许也能善用他们……不只当成避难所而已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You mean, it will be a place where I can develop my notions."</p><p>“你的意思是，我可以在那里发展我的理论。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have promised," said Hummin gravely.</p><p>“你答应过的。”夫铭严肃地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have promised to try, " said Seldon and thought to himself that it was about like promising to try to make a rope out of sand.</p><p>“我只答应试试看。”谢顿一面说，一面想道：就像是答应试着用沙土搓出一条绳子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Conversation had run out after that and Seldon watched the structures of the Streeling Sector as they passed. Some were quite low, while some seemed to brush the "sky." Wide crosspassages broke the progression and frequent alleys could be seen.</p><p>他们的谈话就此告一段落，谢顿开始观察沿途的斯璀璘区建筑。有些建筑物相当低矮，有些则似乎能够“摩天”。宽阔的陆桥不时将道路打断，还能常常看到大大小小的巷道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At one point, it struck him that though the buildings rose upward they also swept downward and that perhaps they were deeper than they were high. As soon as the thought occurred to him, he was convinced it was true. </p><p>在某一刻，他突然想到这些建筑虽然向上发展，但它们同样向下扎根，说不定深度甚至超过高度。心中一旦起了这个念头，他便相信事实正是如此。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Occasionally, he saw patches of green in the background, farther back from the Expressway, and even small trees.</p><p>他偶尔会在远处看到几块绿地，都是在远离捷运路线的地方，有几处甚至还有些小树。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He watched for quite a while and then became aware that the light was growing dimmer. He squinted about and turned to Hummin, who guessed the question.</p><p>他凝望了一阵子，然后发觉光线逐渐变暗。他向左右各瞟了一眼，再转头望向夫铭，后者已经猜到他的疑问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The afternoon is waning," he said, "and night is coming on."</p><p>“下午接近尾声，”他说，“夜晚快要来临了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldons eyebrows raised and the corners of his mouth turned downward. "Thats impressive. I have a picture of the entire planet darkening and then, some hours from now, lighting up again."</p><p>谢顿扬起眉毛，两侧嘴角则往下一撇。“这可真是壮观。我心中浮现一个画面，整个行星同时暗下来，而在数小时后，又重新大放光明。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin smiled his small, careful smile. "Not quite, Seldon. The planet is never turned off altogether……or turned on either. The shadow of twilight sweeps across the planet gradually, followed half a day later by the slow brightening of dawn. In fact, the effect follows the actual day and night above the domes quite closely, so that in higher altitudes day and night change length with the seasons."</p><p>夫铭露出惯有的、谨慎的浅笑。“谢顿，并不尽然。这颗行星的照明从未全部关闭，也从来不曾完全开启。黄昏的阴影渐次扫过整个行星，而在半天之后，又会出现一道破晓的曙光。事实上，这种效应和穹顶上真实的昼夜相当接近，因此在高纬度地区，昼夜的长短会随着季节的变迁而改变。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon shook his head, "But why close in the planet and then mimic what would be in the open?"</p><p>谢顿摇了摇头。“可是为什么要把这颗行星封闭起来，然后再模仿露天的情形呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I presume because people like it better that way. Trantorians like the advantages of being enclosed, but they don't like to be reminded of it unduly, just the same. You know very little about Trantorian psychology, Seldon."</p><p>“我想是因为人们比较喜欢这样。川陀人喜欢封闭世界的优点，却又不喜欢常常想到这个事实。谢顿，你对川陀人的心理知道得很少。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon flushed slightly. He was only a Heliconian and he knew very little about the millions of worlds outside Helicon. His ignorance was not confined to Trantor. How, then, could he hope to come up with any practical applications for his theory of psychohistory?</p><p>谢顿微微涨红了脸。他只是个赫利肯人，对其他数以千万计的世界几乎一无所知，这种无知不仅限于川陀而已。所以说，他怎能期望自己为心理史学理论找出实际应用呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How could any number of people……all together……know enough? </p><p>不论将多少人通通加在一起，又怎能保证他们知道得够多呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It reminded Seldon of a puzzle that had been presented to him when he was young: Can you have a relatively small piece of platinum, with handholds affixed, that could not be lifted by the bare, unaided strength of any number of people, no matter how many?</p><p>这使谢顿想起少年时期读到的一则智力测验：你能不能找到一块不算大的白金，它的表面附有握把，但是不论找来多少人，也不能赤手空拳合力举起它？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The answer was yes. A cubic meter of platinum weighs 22,420 kilograms under standard gravitational pull. If it is assumed that each person could heave 120 kilograms up from the ground, then 188 people would suffice to lift the platinum……But you could not squeeze 188 people around the cubic meter so that each one could get a grip on it. You could perhaps not squeeze more than 9 people around it. And levers or other such devices were not allowed. It had to be "bare, unaided strength."</p><p>答案是可以的。在标准重力下，一立方米的白金重达22420公斤。假设每个人能从地上举起120公斤的重物，那么187个人就足以举起那块白金。可是你无法让187个人挤在一立方米白金的四周，而每个人都能抓住它；你也许顶多只能让9个人挤在它周围。而杠杆或类似装置都不能使用，因为前提是必须“赤手空拳”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the same way, it could be that there was no way of getting enough people to handle the total amount of knowledge required for psychohistory, even if the facts were stored in computers rather than in individual human brains. Only so many people could gather round the knowledge, so to speak, and communicate it.</p><p>同理，也有可能永远无法找到足够多的人，来处理心理史学所需要的所有知识……即使那些历史事实储存在电脑中，而并非各人的大脑里。而唯有藉由电脑，众人才能围绕在这些知识周围（姑且这么说），并且互相交流。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said, "You seem to be in a brown study, Seldon."</p><p>夫铭说：“谢顿，你似乎陷入沉思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Im considering my own ignorance."</p><p>“我正在省思自己的无知。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A useful task. Quadrillions could profitably join you……But its time to get off."</p><p>“这是个有用的工作。数万兆的人都该加入你的行列，这样大家都能受惠。不过，现在该下车了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon looked up. "How can you tell?"</p><p>谢顿抬起头来。“你怎么知道？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Just as you could tell when you were on the Expressway your first day on Trantor. I go by the signs."</p><p>“正如你到川陀的第一天坐捷运时一样，我是根据沿途的路标。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon caught one just as it went by: STREELING UNIVERSITY……3 MINUTES.</p><p>此时，谢顿也看到一个一闪即逝的路标：“斯璀璘大学……三分钟”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We get off at the next boarding station. Watch your step."</p><p>“我们在下一个专用车站下车，小心台阶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seldon followed Hummin off the coach, noting that the sky was deep purple now and that the walkways and corridors and buildings were all lighting up, suffused with a yellow glow.</p><p>谢顿跟着夫铭走下车厢，他注意到天空如今呈深紫色，而人行道、回廊与建筑物都已灯火通明，到处弥漫着一种黄色光晕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It might have been the gathering of a Heliconian night. Had he been placed here blindfolded and had the blindfold been removed, he might have been convinced that he was in some particularly well-built-up inner region of one of Helicons larger cities.</p><p>这也很像是赫利肯的傍晚时分。假如他被蒙着眼睛带到这里，然后取下眼罩，他或许会相信自己正置身于赫利肯某个大城市的中心繁华区。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How long do you suppose I will remain at Streeling University, Hummin?" he asked.</p><p>“夫铭，你想我会在斯璀璘大学待多久？”他问道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hummin said in his usual calm fashion, "That would be hard to say, Seldon. Perhaps your whole life."</p><p>夫铭以一惯的冷静态度答道：“这很难说，谢顿，也许一辈子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What!"</p><p>“什么！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps not. But your life stopped being your own once you gave that paper on psychohistory. The Emperor and Demerzel recognized your importance at once. So did I. For all I know, so did many others. You see, that means you don't belong to yourself anymore."</p><p>“也许不用那么久。可是在你发表那篇心理史学论文之后，你的生命就不再是自己的了。大帝和丹莫刺尔立刻看出你的重要性，而我也是。据我所知，还有很多人和我们一样。你懂了吧，这就代表你再也不属于自己了。”</p></div>
