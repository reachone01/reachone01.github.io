<div class='layout'><p>10</p><p>第10节</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was still pretty early. I'm not sure what time it was, but it wasn't too late. The one thing I hate to do is go to bed when I'm not even tired. So I opened my suitcases and took out a clean shirt, and then I went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt. What I thought I'd do, I thought I'd go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in the Lavender Room. They had this night club, the Lavender Room, in the hotel.</p><p>时间还挺早。我记不清楚已经几点钟了，不过还不算太晚。我最讨厌做的一件事就是我还不觉得困的时候上床睡觉。因此我打开手提箱，取出一件干净衬衫，随后走进浴室，擦洗一下，换了衬衫。我想做的，是下楼去看看“紫丁香厅”里到底他妈的在干什么。他们这个旅馆里有个夜总会，叫作紫丁香厅。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While I was changing my shirt, I damn near gave my kid sister Phoebe a buzz, though. I certainly felt like talking to her on the phone. Somebody with sense and all. But I couldn't take a chance on giving her a buzz, because she was only a little kid and she wouldn't have been up, let alone anywhere near the phone. I thought of maybe hanging up if my parents answered, but that wouldn't've worked, either. They'd know it was me. My mother always knows it's me. She's psychic. But I certainly wouldn't have minded shooting the crap with old Phoebe for a while.</p><p>我在换衬衫的时候，差点儿给我小妹妹菲芘挂了个电话。我倒是真想跟她在电话上谈谈。跟一个真正懂事的人。可我不能冒险打电话给她，因为她还只是个小孩子，这会儿准不会不上床，更不用说不会在电话旁边接电话了。我曾想到万一是我父母来接电话，是不是马上就把电话接了，可这也不是办法。他们会知道是我。我母亲总知道是我。她末卜先知。可我倒是真想找老菲芘聊聊天。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>You should see her. You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life. She's really smart. I mean she's had all A's ever since she started school. As a matter of fact, I'm the only dumb one in the family. My brother D.B.'s a writer and all, and my brother Allie, the one that died, that I told you about, was a wizard. I'm the only really dumb one. </p><p>你真应该见见她。你这一辈子再也不会见过那么漂亮、那么聪明的小孩子。她真是聪明。我是说从上学到现在，门门功课都是优。说实在的，我是家中唯一的笨蛋。我哥哥DB，是个作家什么的，我弟弟艾里，就是我前面跟你谈到过的已经死去的那个，简直是个鬼精灵。惟有我是个真正的笨蛋。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But you ought to see old Phoebe. She has this sort of red hair, a little bit like Allie's was, that's very short in the summertime. In the summertime, she sticks it behind her ears. She has nice, pretty little ears. In the wintertime, it's pretty long, though. Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesn't. It's really nice, though. She's only ten. She's quite skinny, like me, but nice skinny. Roller-skate skinny. I watched her once from the window when she was crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park, and that's what she is, roller-skate skinny. You'd like her. I mean if you tell old Phoebe something, she knows exactly what the hell you're talking about. </p><p>可你真应该见见老菲芘。她也是那种红头发，跟艾里的有点儿相象，在夏天剪得很短。夏天，她总把头发一古脑儿扎在耳朵后面。她的耳朵也挺小挺漂亮。冬天，她的头发蓄得挺长，有时我母亲给她梳成辫子，有时不梳。可那头发的确漂亮得很。她还只十岁。她个儿很瘦，象我一样，可是瘦得很漂亮。室内溜冰的那种瘦。有一次我从窗口望着她穿过五马路向公园走去，她的确是那模样儿，室内溜冰的那种瘦。你见了准会喜欢她。我是说你不管跟老菲芘讲些什么话，她总知道你他妈的讲的什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I mean you can even take her anywhere with you. If you take her to a lousy movie, for instance, she knows it's a lousy movie. If you take her to a pretty good movie, she knows it's a pretty good movie. D.B. and I took her to see this French movie, The Baker's Wife, with Raimu in it. It killed her. Her favorite is The 39 Steps, though, with Robert Donat. She knows the whole goddam movie by heart, because I've taken her to see it about ten times. </p><p>我是说你简直哪儿都可以带她去。你要是带她去看一个蹩脚电影，比方说，她就会知道这电影蹩脚。你要是带她去看一个好电影，她也会知道这电影好。DB跟我曾带她去看法国电影《面包师的妻子》，由莱绍主演。这电影简直要了她的命。可她最爱看的是《三十九步》，罗伯特·唐纳主演。她把那电影都背熟了，因为我带她去看了约莫十次。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When old Donat comes up to this Scotch farmhouse, for instance, when he's running away from the cops and all, Phoebe'll say right out loud in the movie--right when the Scotch guy in the picture says it--"Can you eat the herring?" She knows all the talk by heart. And when this professor in the picture, that's really a German spy, sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing, to show Robert Donat, old Phoebe beats him to it--she holds up her little finger at me in the dark, right in front of my face. She's all right. You'd like her. The only trouble is, she's a little too affectionate sometimes. She's very emotional, for a child. She really is. Something else she does, she writes books all the time. Only, she doesn't finish them. They're all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield--only old Phoebe spells it "Hazle." Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective. She's supposed to be an orphan, but her old man keeps showing up. Her old man's always a "tall attractive gentleman about 20 years of age." That kills me. Old Phoebe. </p><p>当老唐纳到了苏格兰农场的时候，比方说，当他逃避警察的时候，菲芘就会在电影院大声说——就在影片里那个苏格兰人开口说话的时候——“你吃不吃青鱼？”她背得出所有的对话。影片里的那位教授，其实是个德国间谍，还没伸出那个小指头给罗伯特·唐纳看，指头的中间关节还缺了一块，老菲芘已比他先伸手了——她在黑暗中把她的小指头伸了过来，一直伸到我眼面前。她真是不错。你见了准会喜欢她。唯一的缺点是，她有时候有点儿过于亲热。她感情非常容易冲动，就她那个年纪的孩子来说。她的确是。她干的另一件事是一天到晚写书。只是这些书没有一本是写完的。写的全都是关于一个叫作海泽尔·威塞菲尔的孩子——只是老菲芘这把名字写成了“海士尔”。老海士尔·威塞菲尔是个女侦探。她本来应该是个孤儿，可她的老子却经常出现。她的老子总是个“高个子的漂亮绅士，年纪在二十上下”。简直笑死了我。这个老菲芘。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I swear to God you'd like her. She was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid. When she was a very tiny little kid, I and Allie used to take her to the park with us, especially on Sundays. Allie had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on Sundays, and we used to take old Phoebe with us. She'd wear white gloves and walk right between us, like a lady and all. And when Allie and I were having some conversation about things in general, old Phoebe'd be listening. Sometimes you'd forget she was around, because she was such a little kid, but she'd let you know. She'd interrupt you all the time. She'd give Allie or I a push or something, and say, "Who? Who said that? Bobby or the lady?" And we'd tell her who said it, and she'd say, "Oh," and go right on listening and all. She killed Allie, too. I mean he liked her, too. She's ten now, and not such a tiny little kid any more, but she still kills everybody--everybody with any sense, anyway.</p><p>我可以对天发督，你见了她准会喜欢。她还是很小很小的时候，就很聪明。她还是个很小的孩子的时候，我跟艾里常常带她上公园去，尤其在星期天。在星期天，艾里总爱带着他的那只帆船上公园玩，我们总是带着老菲芘一块儿去。她戴着白手套，走在我们中间，就象个贵夫人似的。遇到艾里跟我谈论起什么事情来，老菲芘总是在一旁听着。有时候你会忘掉有她在身边，因为她还是个那么小的孩子，可她总会提醒你。她会不住地打断你。她会推我成者艾里一下，说道：“谁？谁说的？是鲍比还是那位小姐？”我们就告诉她是谁说的，她就会“哦”一声，依旧听下去。她也简直要了艾里的命；我是说他也喜欢她。她现在十岁了，不再是那么个小孩子了，可她依旧惹每个人喜爱——每个有头脑的人，嗯。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Anyway, she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone. But I was too afraid my parents would answer, and then they'd find out I was in New York and kicked out of Pencey and all. So I just finished putting on my shirt. Then I got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on.</p><p>嗯，象她这样的人，你没事总想跟她在电话上聊聊。可我很怕我父母来接电话，那样他们就会发现我在纽约，已给潘西开除了出来，等等一切。所以我光是穿上衬衫，收拾好一切，然后乘电梯下去到休息室里看看。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Except for a few pimpy-looking guys, and a few whory-looking blondes, the lobby was pretty empty. But you could hear the band playing in the Lavender Room, and so I went in there. It wasn't very crowded, but they gave me a lousy table anyway--way in the back. I should've waved a buck under the head-waiter's nose. In New York, boy, money really talks--I'm not kidding.</p><p>除了少数几个王八样的男子，几个婊子样的女人，休息室里简直没什么人，可你听得见乐队在紫丁香厅奏乐，所以我就走了进去。里面并不十分拥挤，可他们依旧给我找了个极不好的桌位——在最后面。其实我早应该拿出一块钱来举到侍者头儿的鼻子底下的。在纽约，嘿，钱真能通神——我不开玩笑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The band was putrid. Buddy Singer. Very brassy, but not good brassy--corny brassy. Also, there were very few people around my age in the place. In fact, nobody was around my age. They were mostly old, show-offy-looking guys with their dates. Except at the table right next to me. At the table right next to me, there were these three girls around thirty or so. The whole three of them were pretty ugly, and they all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didn't really live in New York, but one of them, the blonde one, wasn't too bad. She was sort of cute, the blonde one, and I started giving her the old eye a little bit, but just then the waiter came up for my order. I ordered a Scotch and soda, and told him not to mix it--I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw, they think you're under twenty-one and won't sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had trouble with him anyway, though. "I'm sorry, sir," he said, "but do you have some verification of your age? Your driver's license, perhaps?"</p><p>乐队是糟得要命的布迪·辛格乐队。全是管乐，可不是那种高雅的管乐，而是粗俗的管乐。此外，厅里极少象我这样年纪的人。事实上，没一个象我这样年纪的人。他们大多数都是上了年纪的、装腔作势的家伙约了他们的女朋友在一起。除了我隔壁桌上的几个。在我隔壁桌上坐着三个年约三十的姑娘。三个全都难看得要命，三个全都戴着那么一种帽子，你一看就知道她们不是真正住在纽约的，可是其中有一个金头发的，看上去还可以。她象是那种爱卖俏的女人，那个金头发的，所以我就开始跟她做起媚眼来，可就在这时，那个侍者过来了，问我喝些什么。我要了杯威士忌和苏打水，叫他不要掺和在一起——我说得快的要命，因为你只要稍一结巴，他们就会怀疑你不到二十一岁，不肯卖给你含有酒精的饮料。可是尽管这样，他还是给了我麻烦。“对不起，先生，”他说，“您有什么证明您年龄的证件吗？您的司机执照，比方说？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I gave him this very cold stare, like he'd insulted the hell out of me, and asked him, "Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?"</p><p>我冷冷地瞅了他一眼，好象他给了我极大的侮辱似的，随后问他说：“我的样子象不到二十一岁吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm sorry, sir, but we have our--"</p><p>“对不起，先生，可我们有我们的——”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Okay, okay," I said. I figured the hell with it. "Bring me a Coke." He started to go away, but I called him back. "Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?" I asked him. I asked him very nicely and all. "I can't sit in a corny place like this cold sober. Can'tcha stick a little rum in it or something?"</p><p>“得啦，得啦，”我说。我早就琢磨好了。“给我来杯可口可乐。”他刚转身要走，我又把他叫了回来。“你能掺点儿甜酒什么的吗？”我问他，问得极其客气。“我可不能坐在这样庸俗的地方连一滴酒也不喝。你能掺点儿甜酒什么的吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm very sorry, sir. . ." he said, and beat it on me. I didn't hold it against him, though. They lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor. I'm a goddam minor.</p><p>“非常对不起，先生……”他说着，就走开了。我倒不怎么怪他。要是有人发现他们卖酒给年轻人喝，他们就要丢掉饭碗。而我又年轻得要命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again. That is, the blonde one. The other two were strictly from hunger. I didn't do it crudely, though. I just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all. What they did, though, the three of them, when I did it, they started giggling like morons. They probably thought I was too young to give anybody the once-over. That annoyed hell out of me-- you'd've thought I wanted to marry them or something. I should've given them the freeze, after they did that, but the trouble was, I really felt like dancing. I'm very fond of dancing, sometimes, and that was one of the times. So all of a sudden, I sort of leaned over and said, "Would any of you girls care to dance?" I didn't ask them crudely or anything. Very suave, in fact. But God damn it, they thought that was a panic, too. They started giggling some more. I'm not kidding, they were three real morons. "C'mon," I said. "I'll dance with you one at a time. All right? How 'bout it? C'mon!" I really felt like dancing.</p><p>我又开始跟邻桌上的三个巫婆做起媚眼来。主要当然是对那个金头发的，对其他两个完全是出于无奈。可我也没做得太过火。我只是不时地朝她们三个冷冷地那么瞅一眼。可她们三个见我这样，都象痴子似的格格笑起来。她们也许以为我太年轻，不该这样跟女人做媚眼，这使我火得要命——她们也许以为我要跟她们结婚什么的哩。她们这样做后，我本应该给她们泼瓢冷水的，可糟糕的是，我当时真想跳舞。有时候我非常想跳舞，当时凑巧正是这样的时候。因此突然间，我朝她们弯过身去说：“你们哪位姑娘想跳舞？”我问的时候口气并不冒失，事实上还十分温柔。可是真他妈的，她们把这也看成是一个惊人的举动。她们又开始格格笑起来。我不说玩话，她们是三个真正的痴子。“请吧，”我说。“我请你们三位轮流跟我跳舞。好不好？成吗？请吧！”我可真想跳舞呢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Finally, the blonde one got up to dance with me, because you could tell I was really talking to her, and we walked out to the dance floor. The other two grools nearly had hysterics when we did. I certainly must've been very hard up to even bother with any of them.</p><p>最后，那个金头发的站起来跟我跳舞了，因为谁也看得出我主要是在跟她讲话，我们两个于是进入舞池。我们一定，那两个傻瓜差点儿犯起歇斯底里来。我当然是实在没有办法，才跟她们这样的人打交道的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But it was worth it. The blonde was some dancer. </p><p>可那样做却很值得，这位金发女郎很会跳舞。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was one of the best dancers I ever danced with. I'm not kidding, some of these very stupid girls can really knock you out on a dance floor. You take a really smart girl, and half the time she's trying to lead you around the dance floor, or else she's such a lousy dancer, the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her.</p><p>她是我生平遇到过的跳舞跳得最好的姑娘之一。我不开玩笑，有些极傻极傻的姑娘真能在舞池上把你迷住。那般真正聪明的姑娘不是有一半时间想在舞池上带着你跳，就是压根儿不会跳舞，你最好的办法是干脆留在桌上跟她痛饮一醉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You really can dance," I told the blonde one. "You oughta be a pro. I mean it. I danced with a pro once, and you're twice as good as she was. Did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?"</p><p>“你真能跳舞，”我对金发女郎说。“你真该去当个舞蹈家。我说的是心里话。我跟舞蹈家一起跳过舞，她还不及你一半哩。你可曾听说过玛可和米兰达没有？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?" she said. She wasn't even listening to me. She was looking all around the place.</p><p>“什么？”她说。她甚至都没在听我说话。她一直在东张西望。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I said did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?"</p><p>“我问你听说过玛可和米兰达没有？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know. No. I don't know."</p><p>“我不知道。不，我不知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, they're dancers, she's a dancer. She's not too hot, though. She does everything she's supposed to, but she's not so hot anyway. You know when a girl's really a terrific dancer?"</p><p>“呃，他们是舞蹈家，尤其是那个女的。可她跳得并不太好。她把该做的一切都做了，可她跳得并不怎么好。你可知道一个跳舞跳得真正好的姑娘是怎么样的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Wudga say?" she said. She wasn't listening to me, even. Her mind was wandering all over the place.</p><p>“你说什么？”她说。她甚至都没在听我说话。她的心思完全用在别的地方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I said do you know when a girl's really a terrific dancer?"</p><p>“我问你可知道一个跳舞跳得真正好的姑娘是怎么样的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Uh-uh."</p><p>“啊——啊。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well--where I have my hand on your back. If I think there isn't anything underneath my hand--no can, no legs, no feet, no anything--then the girl's really a terrific dancer."</p><p>“呃——关键就在于我搭在你背上的那只手底下。我要是手底下什么也感觉不到——没有脑袋，没有腿，没有脚，什么也没有——那么这姑娘才是真正会跳舞的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She wasn't listening, though. So I ignored her for a while. We just danced. God, could that dopey girl dance. Buddy Singer and his stinking band was playing "Just One of Those Things" and even they couldn't ruin it entirely. It's a swell song. I didn't try any trick stuff while we danced--I hate a guy that does a lot of show-off tricky stuff on the dance floor--but I was moving her around plenty, and she stayed with me. </p><p>可她并没在听。因此我有好一会儿工夫没搭理她。我们光是跳着舞。天哪，这个傻姑娘真能跳舞。布迪·辛格跟他的臭乐队正在演奏《就是这么回事》，可是连他们也没能把那曲子完全糟蹋掉。这是支了不起的歌曲。我们跳舞的时候，我没想玩什么花样——我最讨厌一个人在舞池上耍花样显本领——可我老带着她转来转去，而她也跟得很好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The funny thing is, I thought she was enjoying it, too, till all of a sudden she came out with this very dumb remark. "I and my girl friends saw Peter Lorre last night," she said. "The movie actor. In person. He was buyin' a newspaper. He's cute."</p><p>可笑的是，我本来还以为她也在欣赏跳舞呢，可突然间她说出了一句十分愚蠢的话。“我和我的女朋友昨天晚上看见了彼得·劳尔，”她说。“那个电影演员。他本人。正在买报纸。他真神气。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're lucky," I told her. "You're really lucky. You know that?" She was really a moron. But what a dancer. I could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the top of her dopey head--you know-- right where the part is, and all. She got sore when I did it.</p><p>“你运气好，”我对她说。“你运气真好。你知道吗？”她真是个痴子。可真能跳舞。我忍不住在她笨脑瓜顶上吻了一下——你知道——正吻在那个笨地方。我吻了以后，她十分生气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hey! What's the idea?"</p><p>“嗨！怎么回事？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing. No idea. You really can dance," I said. "I have a kid sister that's only in the goddam fourth grade. You're about as good as she is, and she can dance better than anybody living or dead."</p><p>“不。没什么。你真能跳舞，”我说。“我有个小妹妹，还在他妈的念小学四年级。你跳得简直跟她一样好，而她跳舞跳得比哪个活着的或者死去的人都好。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Watch your language, if you don't mind."</p><p>“说话留神点儿，你要是不介意的话。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What a lady, boy. A queen, for Chrissake.</p><p>倒真是个贵族小姐，嘿。一位女王，老天爷。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where you girls from?" I asked her.</p><p>“你们几位是打哪儿来的？”我问她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She didn't answer me, though. She was busy looking around for old Peter Lorre to show up, I guess.</p><p>可她并没回答我。她正忙着东张西望，大概是看看老彼得·劳尔有没有在场，我揣摩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where you girls from?" I asked her again.</p><p>“你们几位是打哪儿来的？”我又问了一遍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?" she said.</p><p>“什么？”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where you girls from? Don't answer if you don't feel like it. I don't want you to strain yourself."</p><p>“你们几位是打哪儿来的？你要是不高兴回答，就别回答。我不愿让你太紧张。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Seattle, Washington," she said. She was doing me a big favor to tell me.</p><p>“西雅图，华盛顿州，”她说。她告诉我这话，象是给了我什么天大的恩惠似的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're a very good conversationalist," I told her. "You know that?"</p><p>“你倒真是健谈，”我对她说。“你知道吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What?"</p><p>“什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I let it drop. It was over her head, anyway. "Do you feel like jitterbugging a little bit, if they play a fast one? Not corny jitterbug, not jump or anything--just nice and easy. Everybody'll all sit down when they play a fast one, except the old guys and the fat guys, and we'll have plenty of room. Okay?"</p><p>我没再说下去。反正说了她也不懂。“要是他们演奏一个快步舞曲，你想跳会儿摇摆舞吗？不是那种粗俗的摇摆舞，不是那种跳跳蹦蹦的——而是那种轻松愉快的。只要一奏快步舞曲，那些老的、胖的全都会坐下，咱们的地方就宽敞啦。成不成？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's immaterial to me," she said. "Hey--how old are you, anyhow?"</p><p>“对我说来都无所谓。”她说。“嗨——你到底几岁啦？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That annoyed me, for some reason. "Oh, Christ. Don't spoil it," I said. "I'm twelve, for Chrissake. I'm big for my age."</p><p>不知什么缘故，这话使得我很恼火。“哦，天哪。别煞风景，”我说。“我才十二岁呢，老天爷。我的个儿长的特别高大。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Listen. I toleja about that. I don't like that type language," she said. "If you're gonna use that type language, I can go sit down with my girl friends, you know."</p><p>“听着。我已跟你说了。我不爱听那样说话，”她说。“你要是再那样说话，我可以去跟我的女朋友一块儿坐着，你知道。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I apologized like a madman, because the band was starting a fast one. She started jitterbugging with me-- but just very nice and easy, not corny. She was really good. All you had to do was touch her. And when she turned around, her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all. She knocked me out. I mean it. I was half in love with her by the time we sat down. That's the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if they're not much to look at, or even if they're sort of stupid, you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Jesus Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can.</p><p>我象个疯子似的不住道歉，因为乐队已在奏一个快步舞曲了。她开始跟我一起跳起摇摆舞来——但只是轻松愉快的那种，不是粗俗的那种。她跳得真是好。你只要用手搭着她就成。她让我神魂颠倒了。我说的是心里话。我们一起坐下的时候，我有一半爱上她了。女人就是这样。只要她们做出什么漂亮的举动，尽管她们长的不漂亮，尽管她们有点儿愚蠢，你也会有一半爱上她们，接着你就会不知道自己他妈的身在何处。女人。老天爷，她们真能让你发疯。她们真的能。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They didn't invite me to sit down at their table-- mostly because they were too ignorant--but I sat down anyway. The blonde I'd been dancing with's name was Bernice something--Crabs or Krebs. The two ugly ones' names were Marty and Laverne. I told them my name was Jim Steele, just for the hell of it. Then I tried to get them in a little intelligent conversation, but it was practically impossible. You had to twist their arms. You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them. And the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room, like as if they expected a flock of goddam movie stars to come in any minute. They probably thought movie stars always hung out in the Lavender Room when they came to New York, instead of the Stork Club or El Morocco and all. Anyway, it took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in Seattle. </p><p>她们没请我过去坐到她们桌上——多半是因为她们太没知识——可我还是坐过去了。那个跟我一起跳舞的金发女郎叫作蓓尼丝什么的——我记不清是姓克拉伯斯还是克莱伯斯了。那两个特别丑的叫作马蒂和拉凡恩。我告诉她们我的名字叫吉姆·斯梯尔，当然是他妈的随口胡诌的。接着我想和她们谈些有意思的事，可那简直办不到。你干什么都得扯她们的胳膊。你也很难说她们三个中间到底那一个最傻。她们三个全都在这个混帐房间里不住地东张西望，好象希望看到一大群混帐电影明星随时闯进来似的。她们大概以为那些电惑明星一到纽约，都不去白鹳俱乐部或者爱尔、摩洛哥那类地方，反倒全都来到紫丁香厅。嗯，我差不多费了半个钟头，才打听出她们三个都在西雅图什么地方干活。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They all worked in the same insurance office. I asked them if they liked it, but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dopes? I thought the two ugly ones, Marty and Laverne, were sisters, but they got very insulted when I asked them. You could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one, and you couldn't blame them, but it was very amusing anyway.</p><p>她们全都在一家保险公司里工作。我问她们喜不喜欢那工作，可你以为能从这三个傻瓜嘴里听到什么聪明的回答吗？我本以为那两个丑的，马蒂和拉凡思，是姐妹俩，可我这么一问，却把她们两个都气坏啦。你看得出她们俩谁也不愿自己长的象对方，当然这也不能怪她们，不过仔细想来，倒也十分有趣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I danced with them all--the whole three of them--one at a time. The one ugly one, Laverne, wasn't too bad a dancer, but the other one, old Marty, was murder. Old Marty was like dragging the Statue of Liberty around the floor. The only way I could even half enjoy myself dragging her around was if I amused myself a little. So I told her I just saw Gary Cooper, the movie star, on the other side of the floor.</p><p>我轮流着跟她们三个全都跳了舞。那个叫拉凡思的丑姑娘跳的还不太坏，可另外那个叫马蒂的简直可怕极了。跟老马蒂跳舞，就好象抱着自由女神石像在舞池上拖来拖去。我这样拖着她转来转去的时候，唯一让自己作乐的办法是拿她取个笑儿。因此我告诉她说我刚在舞池那头看见了电影明星加莱·库拍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Where?" she asked me--excited as hell. "Where?"</p><p>“哪儿？”她问我——兴奋得要命。“哪儿？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Aw, you just missed him. He just went out. Why didn't you look when I told you?"</p><p>“唷，你正好错过了他。他刚出去。我刚才跟你说的时候，你干吗不马上回过头去呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She practically stopped dancing, and started looking over everybody's heads to see if she could see him. "Oh, shoot!" she said. I'd just about broken her heart-- I really had. I was sorry as hell I'd kidded her. Some people you shouldn't kid, even if they deserve it.</p><p>她几乎停止跳舞，拼命从大家的头顶上望过去，想最后看他一眼。“唉！唉！”她说。我差点儿碎了她的心——真是差一点儿。我真后悔自己不该跟她开这个玩笑。有些人是不能开玩笑的，尽管他们有可笑的地方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Here's what was very funny, though. When we got back to the table, old Marty told the other two that Gary Cooper had just gone out. Boy, old Laverne and Bernice nearly committed suicide when they heard that. They got all excited and asked Marty if she'd seen him and all. Old Mart said she'd only caught a glimpse of him. That killed me.</p><p>可是最最好笑的还在后面。我们回到桌上以后，老马蒂就告诉其他两个说，加莱·库柏刚刚出去。嘿，老拉凡恩和蓓尼丝听了这话，差点儿都想自杀。她们全都兴奋得要命，问马蒂看见了没有。老马蒂说他只隐约见了他一眼。我听了差点儿笑死。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The bar was closing up for the night, so I bought them all two drinks apiece quick before it closed, and I ordered two more Cokes for myself. The goddam table was lousy with glasses. The one ugly one, Laverne, kept kidding me because I was only drinking Cokes. She had a sterling sense of humor. She and old Marty were drinking Tom Collinses--in the middle of December, for God's sake. They didn't know any better. The blonde one, old Bernice, was drinking bourbon and water. She was really putting it away, too. The whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time. They hardly talked--even to each other. Old Marty talked more than the other two. She kept saying these very corny, boring things, like calling the can the "little girls' room," and she thought Buddy Singer's poor old beat-up clarinet player was really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of ice-cold hot licks. She called his clarinet a "licorice stick." Was she corny. The other ugly one, Laverne, thought she was a very witty type. She kept asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight. She kept asking me if my father had a date or not. Four times she asked me that--she was certainly witty. Old Bernice, the blonde one, didn't say hardly anything at all. Every time I'd ask her something, she said "What?" That can get on your nerves after a while.</p><p>酒吧马上就要停止营业，所以我给她们每人要了两杯饮料，我自己也另外要了两杯可口可乐，这张混帐桌子上摆满了杯子。那个叫拉凡恩的丑姑娘不住地拿我取笑，因为我光喝可口可乐。她倒真富于幽默感。她和老马蒂只喝汤姆·柯林斯——还是在十二月中旬，我的天。她们除此之外不知道喝什么别的。那个金发女郎老德尼丝光喝掺水的威士忌。而且也真的喝得一滴不剩。三个人老是在寻找电影明星。她们很少讲话——甚至在她们彼此之间。老马蒂比起其余两个来，讲的话还算多些。她老是说着那种粗俗的、叫人脑烦的话，比如管厕所叫“小姑娘的房间”，看见布迪·辛格乐队里那个又老又糟的吹木箫的站起来呜呜吹了几下，就认为他吹的好得了不得。她还管那根木箫叫“甘草棒”。你说她粗俗不粗俗？另外那个叫拉凡恩的丑姑娘白以为非常俏皮。她老叫我打电话给我父亲，问问他今晚上在干什么。她还老问我父亲约了女朋友没有。这话整整问了四遍——她倒真是俏皮。那个金发女郎老蓓尼丝简直一句话也不说。每次我问她什么，她总是说“什么？”这样要不多久，会使你的神经受不了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All of a sudden, when they finished their drink, all three of them stood up on me and said they had to get to bed. They said they were going to get up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall. I tried to get them to stick around for a while, but they wouldn't. So we said good-by and all. I told them I'd look them up in Seattle sometime, if I ever got there, but I doubt if I ever will. Look them up, I mean.</p><p>突然间，她们喝完自己的酒，三个全都站起来冲着我说她们要去睡了。她们说明天一早还要到无线电城的音乐厅去看早场电影。我还想留她们多呆一会儿，可她们不肯，因此我们互相说了声再见。我对她们说我要是有机会到西雅图，一定去拜望她们，可我很怀疑自己说的话。我是说怀疑我自己会不会真的去拜望她们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With cigarettes and all, the check came to about thirteen bucks. I think they should've at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them--I wouldn't've let them, naturally, but they should've at least offered. I didn't care much, though. They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all. And that business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed me. If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance, comes all the way to New York--from Seattle, Washington, for God's sake--and ends up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City Music Hall, it makes me so depressed I can't stand it. I'd've bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only they hadn't told me that.</p><p>加上香烟什么的，账单上共约十三元。我想，她们至少应该提出来付一部分帐款，就是在我坐到她们桌上去之前她们自己叫的那些饮料帐——我自然不会让她们付，可她们至少应该提一下。不过我并不在乎。她们实在太没知识了，她们还戴着那种又难看又花哨的帽子哩。还有，她们一早起来要去无线电城音乐厅看早场电影一事也让我十分懊丧。假如有人，比如说一个戴着极难看帽子的姑娘，老远来到纽约——还是从华盛顿州的西雅图来的，老夫爷——结果却是一早起来去无线电城音乐厅看一场混帐的早场电影，那就会让我懊丧得受不了。只要她们不告诉我这一点，我宁肯请她们喝一百杯酒哩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I left the Lavender Room pretty soon after they did. They were closing it up anyway, and the band had quit a long time ago. In the first place, it was one of those places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with, or unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just Cokes. There isn't any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk. Or unless you're with some girl that really knocks you out.</p><p>她们一走，我也就离开了紫丁香厅。他们反正也快关门了，乐队已经离开很久了。首先，这类地方简直没法呆，除非有个跳舞跳得好的姑娘陪着你跳舞，或者除非那里的侍者让你买的不光是可口可乐，而是一些真正的饮料。世界上没有一个夜总会可以让你长久坐下去，除非你至少可以买点儿酒痛饮一醉，或者除非你是跟一个让你神魂颠倒的姑娘在一起。</p></div>
