<p>At that moment, a woman dressed as a  peasant flung herself into his arms; he had difficulty in recognising her. It  was Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>

<p>就在这时，一个村姑打扮的女人投入他的怀抱，他简直认不出她了。原来是德·拉莫尔小姐。</p>

<p>Notwithstanding  his prejudices against Mademoiselle de La Mole, prejudices of which, moreover,  he had not himself formed any definite idea,Julien found her extremely  good-looking. How could he fail to see in all this manner of speech and action  a noble, <a href="#" title="无私心的，廉洁的，公平的。">disinterested</a> sentiment, far above anything that a petty, vulgar  spirit would have dared? He imagined once again that he was in love with a  queen, and after a few moments it was with a rare nobility of speech and  thought that he said to her:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>尽管于连对德·拉莫尔小姐怀有种种戒备之心，他还是觉得她非常漂亮，再说这些戒备之心他也未曾明确地承认过。他如何能在她的这些作法和说法中看不到一种高贵的、无私的、高踞于一个渺小庸俗的灵魂所敢做的一切之上的感情呢？他还相信他在爱着一位女王，过了一会儿，他对她说，措辞和思想都高尚得罕见：</p>

<p>'The  future was tracing itself quite clearly before my eyes. After my death, I  married you to Croisenois, who would be marrying a widow.The  noble but slightly romantic spirit of this charming widow, startled and  converted to the service of common prudence by an event at once singular,  tragic and for her <abbr title="重大的,重要的,声势浩大的(斗争)。">momentous</abbr>, would have deigned to appreciate the quite  genuine merit of the young Marquis.

I  have already caused him so much sorrow! The Academician will say that he has  been warming a serpent in his bosom.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“未来已在我的眼前勾画得很清楚。我死后，我要您嫁给德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生，他将娶一个寡妇。这位可爱的寡妇的心灵是高贵的，但有点儿浪漫，经历过一桩奇特的、悲剧性的、对她来说是伟大的事件，震惊之余，转而崇拜普通人的谨慎，这颗心灵可以理解年轻的侯爵的很现实的优点。您会甘心于快快活活地享受世人的幸福：尊重，财富，地位……然而，亲爱的玛第尔德，您来贝藏松，如果让人发现了，那对德·拉莫尔先生可是致命的打击啊，这是我永远也不能宽恕我自己的。我已经给他造成那么多的痛苦了！院士要说他在怀里暖和了一条蛇了。”</p>

<p>'I  must confess that I hardly expected so much cold reasoning, so much thought for  the future,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole, half annoyed. 'My maid, who is  almost as prudent as yourself, procured a passport for herself, and it is in  the name of Madame Michelet that I have travelled post.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我承认我没有料到会听见这么多冷静的道理，这么多对未来的关注，”德·拉莫尔小姐有点儿生气地说，“我的女仆几乎跟您一样谨慎，她还为自己弄了一张通行证呢，我是以米什莱太太的名义乘坐驿车的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  Madame Michelet found it so easy to make her way in to me?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那么米什莱太太也能够同样容易地来到我这里吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  You are still the superior man, the man of my choice! First of all, I offered a  hundred francs to a magistrate's secretary, who assured me that it was  impossible for me to enter this dungeon. But after taking the money, this  honest man made me wait, raised objections, I thought that he meant to rob me …  ' She broke off.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！你仍然是出类拔萃的人，是我看中的人！起初我见到一个法官的秘书，他说我不能进塔楼，我给了他一百法郎。但是这位正经人拿到钱以后，却让我等着，还提出不少问题，我想他是要骗我的钱……”她停下不说了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well?'  asked Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“后来呢？”于连问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  not be angry with me, my little Julien,' she said, embracing him, 'I was  obliged to give my name to this secretary, who took me for a young milliner  from Paris, enamoured of the handsome Julien… Indeed, those are his very words.  I swore to him that I was your wife, and I am to have permission to see you  every day.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“别生气，我的小于连，”她一边吻他，一边说，“我只好向这个秘书说出了我的姓名，他把我当成了一个巴黎的小女工，爱上了英俊的于连……实际上，这正是他的原话。我对他发誓说我是你的妻子，我会得到准许每天来看你的。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  finishes everything,' thought Julien; 'I could not prevent it. After all, M. de  La Mole is so great a nobleman that public opinion will easily find an excuse  for the young Colonel who will wed this charming widow. My approaching death  will cover everything'; and he abandoned himself with ecstasy to Mathilde's  love; there followed madness, <a href="#" title="宽仁，雅量，高尚；宽宏大量的行为；高尚的行为。">magnanimity</a>, everything that was most strange.  She seriously proposed to him that she should die with him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“真是疯狂到了极点，”于连想，“我无法阻止她。反正，德·拉莫尔先生是个如此显赫的贵人，舆论总会找到理由原谅那位娶了这位可爱的寡妇的年轻上校的。我即将到来的死很快会掩盖一切。”于是，他纵情享受玛蒂尔德的爱情给他带来的欢乐；那是疯狂，是灵魂的伟大，是最为奇特的东西。她郑重其事地说要跟他一起去死。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After  these first transports, and when she had grown used to the happiness of seeing  Julien, a keen curiosity suddenly took possession of her soul. She examined her  lover, and found him far superior to what she had imagined. Boniface de La Mole  seemed to her reincarnate in him,but in a more heroic mould.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过最初的狂热，当她饱尝了见到于连的幸福之后，她的心突然被一种强烈的好奇心握住。她端详她的情人，发现他远远地高出她的想象。博尼法斯·德·拉莫尔似乎复活了，然而更有英雄气概。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde saw the  leading counsel of the place, whom she insulted by offering them gold too  crudely; but they ended by accepting.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德会见了当地最好的几位律师，她过于露骨地提出给他们钱，冒犯了他们；不过，他们最后还是接受了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  speedily came to the conclusion that in doubtful matters of high import,  everything in Besancon depended upon M. l'abbe de Frilair.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她很快明白，在贝藏松，凡是可疑的、重大的事情，都得靠德·福利莱神甫解决。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Under  the obscure name of Madame Michelet, she at first found <a href="#" title="1.不能克服的，难以越过的。
2.不可战胜的，无敌的。">insuperable</a> obstacles  in the way to the presence of the all-powerful leader of the Congregation. But  the rumour of the beauty of a young milliner,madly in love, who had come from  Paris to Besancon to comfort the young abbe Julien Sorel, began to spread  through the town.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她发现，顶着米什莱太太这么个卑微的名字，要见到圣会中最有权势的人物，真是难上加难。然而城里已经盛传，一个时装店的漂亮女工，疯狂地爱上了年轻的神甫于连·索莱尔，从巴黎跑到贝藏松来安慰他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  went alone and on foot through the streets of Besancon; she hoped that she  might not be recognised. In any event, she thought that it must help her cause  to create a strong impression upon the populace. In her folly she thought of  making them revolt, to save Julien on his way to the <a href="#" title="[ 'skæfəld ]1.【建筑】脚手架。

4.【解剖学】骨骼，骨架。">scaffold</a>. Mademoiselle de  La Mole imagined herself to be dressed simply and in a manner becoming a woman  stricken with grief; she was dressed in such a fashion as to attract every eye.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德孤身一人，在贝藏松的街上走来走去，她希望不被人认出来。无论如何，她也不相信在老百姓中造成轰动会对她的事情没有用。她甚至疯狂到想鼓动他们造反，在于连赴刑场的途中把他救下。德·拉莫尔小姐以为穿戴简扑，适合一位忧患中的女人，实际上她的穿戴仍然颇引人注目。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  was the sole object of attention in Besancon, when, after a week of  solicitation, she obtained an audience of M. Frilair.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过了八天的请求，她果然成了众人注意的目标，她获准会见德·福利莱先生。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>Great  as her courage might be, the idea of an influential head of the Congregation  and that of a profound and cautious rascality were so closely associated in her  mind that she trembled as she rang the bell at the door of the Bishop's palace.  She could barely stand when she had to climb the stair that led to the First  Vicar-General's apartment. The loneliness of the episcopal palace chilled her  with fear. 'I may sit down in an armchair, and the armchair grip me by the  arms, I shall have vanished. Of  whom can my maid ask for news of me? The Captain of Police will decline to  interfere… I am all alone in this great town!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>有势力的圣会成员，种种精心策划的罪行，这两种想法在她的脑海中联系得如此紧密。尽管她很勇敢，拉主教府的门铃时仍免不了要发抖。她登上楼梯，走向首席代理主教的房间，几乎迈不动步了。主教宫邸的空阔寂寥，使她感到浑身发冷。“我可能坐在一张扶手椅上，扶手椅抓住我的胳膊，我就消失了。我的女仆找谁去打听我的下落呢？宪兵队长也不会轻易采取行动……我在这座大城市里孤立无援！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Her  first sight of the apartment set Mademoiselle de La Mole's heart at rest. First  of all, it was a footman in the most elegant livery that had opened the door to  her. The parlour in which she was asked to wait displayed that refined and  delicate luxury, so different from vulgar magnificence, which one finds in  Paris only in the best houses. As soon as she caught sight of M. de Frilair,  who came towards her with a fatherly air,all thoughts of a <a href="#" title=" ['dæstəd]
    adj.畏缩的
    n.懦夫">dastard</a>ly crime  vanished. She did not even find on his handsome countenance the imprint of that  energetic, that almost wild virtue, so antipathetic to Parisian society. The  halfsmile that animated the features of the priest who was in supreme control  of everything at Besancon, betokened the man used to good society, the cultured  prelate,the able administrator. Mathilde imagined herself in Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第一眼看见代理主教的房间，德·拉莫尔小姐就松了口气。首先，来给她开门的男仆穿着华丽的号衣。她等候召见的那间客厅展示出一派精美细腻的豪华，与那种粗俗的富贵气大不相同，在巴黎也只能在几个最好的人家里见到。德·福利莱先生来了，她一见他那父执般的神情，所有有关残酷的罪行的想法顿时烟消云散。她甚至在这张漂亮面孔上找不到一点那种刚毅的、有些野蛮的、颇令巴黎上流社会反感的能力的印记。这个在贝藏松执掌一切的教士的脸上浮动着浅浅的微笑，显示出他是一个有教养的人，有学问的高级教士，精明的行政官员。玛蒂尔德简直以为自己是在巴黎。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It  needed only a few minutes for M. de Frilair to lead Mathilde on to admit to him  that she was the daughter of his powerful adversary, the Marquis de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>没有多久，德·福利莱先生就使玛蒂尔德承认，她是他的劲敌德·拉莫尔侯爵的女儿。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I  am not, as a matter of fact, Madame Michelet,' she said, resuming all the  loftiness of her bearing, 'and this admission costs me little, for I have come  to consult you, Sir, as to the possibility of procuring the escape of M. de La  Vernaye. In the first place he is guilty of nothing worse than a piece of  stupidity; the woman at whom he fired is doing well. In the second place, to  corrupt the subordinates, I can put down here and now fifty thousand francs,  and bind myself to pay double that sum. Lastly,my gratitude and the gratitude  of my family will consider no request impossible from the person who has saved  M. de La Vernaye.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“事实上我不是什么米什莱太太，”她说，完全恢复了高傲的态度，“承认这一点对我并不难，因为我是来向您，先生，询问有无可能安排德·拉韦尔奈先生越狱。首先，他是一时糊涂才犯了罪，他开枪打伤的那个女人现在身体很好；其次，为了引诱下面的人，我可以立即拿出五万法郎，我还保证加倍。最后，我本人和我全家为了感激救出德·拉韦尔奈先生的人，没有什么事情是做不到的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>M.  de Frilair appeared to be surprised at this name. Mathilde showed him a number  of letters from the Ministry of War, addressed to M. Julien Sorel de La  Vernaye.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·福利莱先生对这个名字感到惊奇。玛蒂尔德给他看了好几封陆军部长给于连·索莱尔·德·拉韦尔奈先生的信件。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  see, Sir, that my father undertook to provide for his future. I married him  secretly, my father wished him to be a senior officer before making public this  marriage, which is a little odd for a La Mole.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您看，先生，我父亲负责栽培他。我和他已秘密结婚，我父亲希望在宣布这桩对德·拉莫尔家的女人有些奇怪的婚姻之前，使他成为高级军官。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  remarked that the expression of benevolence and of a mild gaiety speedily  vanished as M. de Frilair began to arrive at important discoveries. A subtlety  blended with profound insincerity was portrayed on his features.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>玛蒂尔德注意到，德·福利莱先主随着一些重要情况的获知，仁慈和快活的表情迅速从脸上消失了，呈现出来的是一种杂有极端虚假的狡猾。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe had his doubts, he perused the official documents once more slowly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>神甫还有怀疑，又慢慢地把那些正式的文件读了一遍。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  advantage can I gain from these strange confidences?' he asked himself. 'Here I  am suddenly brought into close personal contact with a friend of the famous  Marechale de Fervaques, the all-powerful niece of the Lord Bishop of ——, through  whom one becomes a Bishop in France.'What  I have always regarded as hidden in the future suddenly presents itself. This  may lead me to the goal of all my ambition.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我能从这奇特的心腹话里得到行—么好处？”他暗想。“我一下子和德·费瓦克元帅夫人的—位朋友搭上了密切的关系。元帅夫人可是德·某某主教大人的最有权势的侄女呀，通过她就能在法国当上主教。我过去还只是在未来才能看见的东西，不料想一下子出现在眼前。这可以让我实现我的一切愿望。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  first Mathilde was alarmed by the rapid change in the physiognomy of this  powerful man, with whom she found herself shut up alone in a remote part of the  building. 'But why!' she said to herself presently, 'would it not have been  worse to have made no impression upon the cold <a href="#" title="['iːɡəʊ.ɪz(ə)m]
    n.利己主义；自高自大；自负；自我主义
    网络自我中心；唯我主义；自我中心主义">egoism</a> of a priest sated with  the enjoyment of power?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个如此有权势的人，玛蒂尔德单独跟他呆在一套背静的房子里，他那面容的迅速变化一开始很使她害怕。“什么！”她很快便对自己说，“对一个渴望权力和享乐的教士的冰冷的利己主义一点儿影响也产生不了，那运气不是太坏了吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Dazzled  by this rapid and unexpected avenue to the episcopate that was opening before  his eyes, astonished at Mathilde's intelligence, for a moment M. de Frilair was  off his guard. Mademoiselle de La Mole saw him almost at her feet, trembling  nervously with the intensity of his ambition.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>通往主教职位的一条捷径意外地出现在德·福利莱先生面前，看得他眼花缭乱，加上对玛蒂尔德的才华感到惊讶，他一时竟丧失了警惕。德·拉莫尔小姐看见他几乎要匍匐在她脚下了，他野心勃勃，激动难耐，甚至神经质地抖动不己。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Everything  becomes clear,' she thought, 'nothing will be impossible here for a friend of  Madame de Fervaques.' Despite a sense of jealousy that was still most painful,  she found courage to explain that Julien was an intimate friend of the  Marechale, and almost every evening used to meet, in her house, the Lord Bishop  of ——.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一切都清楚了，”她想，“德·费瓦克夫人的女友在此地没有办不成的事。”尽管嫉妒的感情还在使她痛苦，她却仍有勇气说于连是元帅夫人的密友，几手每大都在她家里看见德·某某主教大人。</p>



</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  you were to draw by lot four or five times in succession a list of thirty-six  jurymen from among the principal inhabitants of this Department,' said the  Vicar-General with the harsh glare of ambition, dwelling upon each of his  words, 'I should consider myself most unfortunate if in each list I did not  find eight or nine friends, and those the most intelligent of the lot. Almost  invariably I should have a majority, more than that, even for a verdict of  guilty; you see, Mademoiselle, with what ease I can secure an acquittal… &quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“在本省最著名的居民中连续抽签四、五次，决定一份三十六名陪审言的名单，”代理主教说，目光中流露出强烈的野心，每个字都加重了语气，“要是在每一次的名单上我找不到八个到十个朋友，而且是那群人中最聪明的，那可真算我交了好运了。我几乎总能得到多数，甚至比判决所需还要多；您看，小姐，我可以很容易地得到免诉判决……”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The  abbe broke off suddenly, as though startled by the sound of his words; he was  admitting things which are never uttered to the profane.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>神甫突然住口不说了，仿佛听见了自己的声音而感到奇怪；他说了一些绝不应对圈外人说的事情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  Mathilde in turn was stupefied when he informed her that what was most  astonishing and interesting to Besancon society in Julien's strange adventure,  was that in the past he had inspired a grand passion in Madame de Renal, which  he had long <a href="#" title="美 [rɪ'sɪprə.keɪt]

    v.回报；回应；沿直线往复移动
    互换；酬答；报答">reciprocated</a>. M. de Frilair had no difficulty in perceiving the  extreme distress which his story produced.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>然而，该轮到他让玛蒂尔德目瞪口呆了，他告诉她，于连的奇特遭遇中最令贝藏松的社会感到惊奇和有趣的是，他过去曾激起德·莱纳夫人巨大的热情，而且两人彼此长期热恋。德·福利莱先生不难看出，他的叙述引起了极度的慌乱。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'I  have my revenge!' he thought. 'Here, at last, is a way of controlling this  decided young person; I was trembling lest I should not succeed in finding  one.' Her distinguished air, as of one not easily led, intensified in his eyes  the charm of the rare beauty which he saw almost <a href="#" title=" ['sʌpliənt]
adj.恳求的[人]">suppliant</a> before him. He  recovered all his selfpossession and had no hesitation in turning the knife in  the wound.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我可报复了！”他想，“终于有了办法来摆布这个如此坚决的年轻女人了；我还害怕不能成功呢。”高贵的神态和不易控制，在他眼里，更增加这位稀世美人的魅力，他看见她差不多要哀求他了。他又镇定如初，毫不犹豫地转动插进她心中的那把匕首。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  should not be surprised after all,' he said to her lightly, 'were we to learn  that it was from jealousy that M. Sorel fired two shots at this woman whom once  he loved so dearly. She must have had some <a href="#" title="[.riːlæk'seɪʃ(ə)n]

</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“总之，”他口气轻松地说，“如果我们获悉索莱尔先生是出于嫉妒才向他曾经那样爱过的女人开了两枪，我是不会感到意外的。她绝非没有吸引力，最近她经常会见一个从第戎来的什么马基诺神甫，也是一个没有道德的詹森派，他们都是一路货色。”</p>

<p>德·福利莱先生无意中发现了这个漂亮女孩的弱点，就兴味盎然地，不慌不忙地折磨她的心。</p>

<p>'Why,'  he said, fixing a pair of burning eyes on Mathilde, 'should M.Sorel have chosen  the church, if not because at that very moment his rival was celebrating mass  there? Everyone agrees in ascribing boundless intelligence and even more  prudence to the man who is so fortunate as to enjoy your protection. What more  simple than to conceal himself in M.de Renal's gardens, which he knows so well?  There, with almost a certainty of not being seen, nor caught, nor suspected, he  could have inflicted death on the woman of whom he was jealous.'</p>

<p>“为什么，”他说，一双火辣辣的眼睛盯着玛蒂尔德，“索莱尔先主选择了教堂，如果不是因为他的情敌正在那儿做弥撒？大家都承认您保护的那个幸运儿非常聪明，而且更是谨慎。还有比躲在他很熟悉的德·莱纳先生的花园里更简单的吗？在那儿几乎万无一失，不会被看见，不会被抓住，不会被怀疑，他就能让那他嫉妒的女人死。”</p>

<p>These  arguments, apparently so well founded, reduced Mathilde to utter despair. Her  spirit, haughty enough but saturated with all that dry prudence which passes in  society as a faithful portrayal of the human heart, was not made to understand  in a moment the joy of defying all prudence which can be so keen a joy to an  ardent soul. In the upper classes of Parisian society, in which Mathilde had  lived, passion can only very rarely <a href="#" title="[daɪ'vest]

</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这番推理后起来那样地正确，终于使玛蒂尔德失去理智。这颗高傲的灵魂浸透了那种在上流社会被视为能忠实地描绘人心的干枯的谨慎，不能很快地理解藐视一切谨慎乃是一种幸福，对一个热情的灵魂来说，这种幸福可以是很强烈的。在玛蒂尔德生活的巴黎上层阶级中，热情只能在很少的情况下摆脱谨慎，从窗户往下跳的都是住在六层楼以上的人。</p>

<p>At  last the abbe de Frilair was sure of his control. He gave Mathilde to  understand (he was probably lying) that he could influence as he chose the  Crown Counsel, who would have to support the charge against Julien.</p>

<p>最后，德·福利莱神甫对自己的控制已有十分的把握。他让玛蒂尔德明白（他当然在说谎）他能随意支配负责对于连提出起诉的那个检察院。</p>
