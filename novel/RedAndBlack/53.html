  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>The  grave personage continued; one could see that he knew; he set forth with a  gentle and moderate eloquence, which vastly delighted Julien, the following  great truths:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那个庄重的人继续发言，看得出，他熟悉情况；他的雄辩温和而有节制，于连非常喜欢，他陈述了下列重大事实：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>(1) England has not a guinea at our  service; economy and Hume are the fashion there. Even the Saints will not give  us any money, and Mr Brougham will laugh at us.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一，英国没有一个基尼可以帮助我们；经济和休漠在那里大为风行。甚至那些圣人也不会给我们钱，布鲁汉姆先生将嘲笑我们。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>(2) Impossible to obtain more than two  campaigns from the Monarchs of Europe, without English gold; and two campaigns  will not be enough against the middle classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“二，没有英国的黄金，就不能让欧洲那些国王打两个战役；而两个战役还不足以对付小资产阶级。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>(3) Necessity of forming an armed party in  France, otherwise the monarchical principle in the rest of Europe will not risk  even those two campaigns.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“三，有必要在法国建立一个武装的政党，舍此欧洲的王政原则连这两个战役也不敢打。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  fourth point which I venture to suggest to you as self-evident is this:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“第四点是显而易见的，我斗胆向你们提出：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  impossibility of forming an armed party in France without the Clergy. I say it  to you boldly, because I am going to prove it to you, Gentlemen. We must give  the Clergy everything:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“没有教士，就不可能在法国建立—个武装的政党。我敢于向你们提出，因为我将向你们证明，先生们。应该将一切给予教士。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'(i)  Because, occupying themselves with their own business night and day, and guided  by men of high capacity established out of harm's way three hundred leagues  from your frontiers … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一，因为他们忙于事务，不分昼夜，指导他们的人能力极强，远离风暴，距你们的边界三百里之遥……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  Rome! Rome!' exclaimed the master of the house …</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！罗马，罗马！”房主人叫起来……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  Sir, Rome!' the Cardinal answered proudly. 'Whatever be the more or less  ingenious pleasantries which were in fashion when you were young, I will  proclaim boldly, in 1830, that the Clergy, guided by Rome, speak and speak  alone to the lower orders.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，先生，罗马！”红衣主教自豪地说。“不管你们年轻时流行过什么巧妙的笑话，我在一八三０年要大声说，只有罗马指导下的教士能对老百姓讲话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Fifty  thousand priests repeat the same words on the day indicated by their leaders,  and the people, who, after all, furnish the soldiers, will be more stirred by  the voice of their priests than by all the cheap poems in the world… .' (This  personal allusion gave rise to murmurs.)</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“五万名教士在头头们指定的日子里重复同样的话，而老百姓呢，说到底毕竟是他们提供士兵，比起世界上所有的歪诗来，他们更容易被教士的声音打动……（这种人身攻击引起了一阵叽叽喳喳的议论。）</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  Clergy have an intellect superior to yours,' the Cardinal went on,raising his  voice; 'all the steps that you have taken towards this essential point, having  an armed party here in France, have been taken by us.' Here facts were cited.  Who had sent eighty thousand muskets to the Vendee? and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“教士的才能高于你们的才能，”红衣主教提高了嗓音，“为了这个主要目标，即在法国建立武装政党，你们做过的，我们都做过了。”这里他列举事实……“谁把八万条枪送往旺岱……等等，等等。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  long as the Clergy are deprived of their forests, they have no tenure. At the  first threat of war, the Minister of Finance writes to his agents that there is  no more money except for the parish priests. At heart, France is not religious,  and loves war. Whoever it be that gives her war, he will be doubly popular, for  to make war is to starve the Jesuits, in vulgar parlance; to make war is to  deliver those monsters of pride, the French people, from the menace of foreign  intervention.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“教士没有树林，就一事无成。一打仗，财政部长就给办事的人写信，通知他除了给本堂神甫的钱之外，别的钱一概没有。其实，法国不信教。它喜欢的是战争。谁让它打仗，谁就倍受欢迎，因为，用老百姓的话说，打仗就是让耶稣会士挨饿，打仗就是让法国人这骄傲的怪物摆脱外国干涉的威胁。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Cardinal had a favourable hearing … 'It was essential,' he said,'that M. de  Nerval should leave the Ministry, his name caused needless irritation.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>红衣主教的话大受欢迎……“应该让德·奈瓦尔先生离开内阁，”他说，“他的名字实为无谓的刺激。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Upon  this, they all rose to their feet and began speaking at once. 'They will be  sending me out of the room again,' thought Julien; but the prudent chairman  himself had forgotten Julien's presence and indeed his existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>听见这句话，所有的人都站起来了，七嘴八舌地嚷嚷。“又该让我走了，”于连想，然而连谨慎的主席本人都已忘了于连的在场甚至存在了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Every  eye turned to a man whom Julien recognised. It was M. de Nerval, the First  Minister, whom he had seen at the Duc de Retz's ball.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>所有的眼睛都在找一个人，于连认出来了，那是内阁总理德·奈瓦尔先生，于连在德·雷斯公爵的舞会上见过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  disorder was at its height, as the newspapers say, when reporting the sittings  of the Chamber. After fully a quarter of an hour, silence began to be restored.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>—片混乱，如同报纸谈到议会时所说。过了整整一刻钟，才稍许静了下来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Then  M. de Nerval rose and, adopting the tone of an Apostle:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，德·奈瓦尔先生站起来，一副使徒的腔调：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  shall not for one moment pretend,' he said, in an unnatural voice,'that I am  not attached to office.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我绝不向你们保证，”他怪里怪气地说，“说我不恋栈。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  has been proved to me, Gentlemen, that my name doubles the strength of the  Jacobins by turning against us a number of moderate men. I should willingly  resign, therefore; but the ways of the Lord are visible to but a small number;  but,' he went on, looking fixedly at the Cardinal, 'I have a mission; heaven  has said to me: &quot;You shall lay down your head on the scaffold, or you  shall reestablish the Monarchy in France, and reduce the Chambers to what  Parliament was under Louis XV,&quot; and that, Gentlemen, I will do.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“事实向我证明，先生们，我的名字使许多温和派反对我们，从而加强了雅各宾党人的力量。因此，我乐意引退，然而天主的道路只有少数人才看得见，”他又补充说，两眼盯着红衣主教，“我负有使命，上天对我说：你将把你的头送上绞架，或者你将在法国恢复王政，将议会两院削弱至路易十五治下的最高法院的程度。而这件事，先生们，我将去做。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  ceased, sat down, and a great silence fell.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他不说了，坐下，一片肃静。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There  is a good actor,' thought Julien. He made the mistake, then as always, of  crediting people with too much cleverness.Animated  by the debates of so lively an evening, and above all by the sincerity of the  discussion, at that moment M. de Nerval believed in his mission. With his great  courage the man did not combine any sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“真是一个好演员，”于连想。他又错了，总是把人想得太聪明。德·奈瓦尔先生受到一夜如此热烈的辩论、尤其是讨论的诚恳态度的激励，此刻对他的使命深信不疑。此人勇气可嘉，但没有头脑。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Midnight  struck during the silence that followed the fine peroration 'that I will do'.  Julien felt that there was something imposing and funereal in the sound of the  clock. He was deeply moved.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在紧跟着“我将去做”这句豪语而来的一片肃静中，午夜的钟声响了。于连觉得时钟的声音中有一种庄严而阴郁的东西。他被打动了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  discussion soon began again with increasing energy and above all with an  incredible simplicity. 'These men will have me poisoned,' thought Julien, at  certain points. 'How can they say such things before a plebeian?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>讨论很快重新开始，越来越活跃，尤其那股天真劲儿简直令人难以置信。“这些人会让人毒死我的，”于连有时候想，“怎么能在一个平民面前说这些东西？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Two  o'clock struck while they were still talking. The master of the house had long  been asleep; M. de La Mole was obliged to ring to have fresh candles brought  in. M. de Nerval, the Minister, had left at a quarter to two, not without  having frequently studied Julien's face in a mirror which hung beside him. His  departure had seemed to create an atmosphere of relief.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>两点的钟声响了，他们还在说。房主人早已睡着；德·拉莫尔先生不得不摇铃叫人来换蜡烛。总理德·奈瓦尔一点三刻离去，没少从他身边的镜子里研究于连的相貌。他的离去似乎让所有的人都感到自在。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While  the candles were being changed: 'Heaven knows what that fellow is going to say  to the King!' the man with the waistcoats murmured to his neighbour. 'He can  make us look very foolish and spoil our future.'You  must admit that he shows a very rare presumption, indeed ef frontery, in  appearing here. He used to come here before he took office; but a portfolio  alters everything, swallows up all a man's private interests, he ought to have  felt that.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在换蜡烛的时候，背心先生低声对旁边的人说：“天知道这个人要对国王说什么！他可能说我们很可笑，毁掉我们的未来。“应该承认，他上这儿来，真是少有的自负，甚至厚颜无耻。他组阁以前常到这儿来，但是总理职位到手，什么就都变了，个人的兴趣也荡然无存，他应该感觉到这一点。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  soon as the Minister was gone, Bonaparte's General had shut his eyes. He now  spoke of his health, his wounds, looked at his watch, and left.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>总理刚出去。波拿巴的将军就闭上了眼睛。这时，他谈他的健康，他负的伤，看了看表，走了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  would bet,' said the man with the waistcoats, 'that the General is running  after the Minister; he is going to make his excuses for being found here, and  pretend that he is our leader.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我敢打赌，”背心先生说，“将军去追总理了，跟他道歉，说他不该到这儿来，并且声称他领导我们。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  the servants, who were half asleep, had finished changing the candles:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>半睡的仆人换完了蜡烛。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Let  us now begin to deliberate, Gentlemen,' said the chairman, 'and no longer  attempt to persuade one another. Let us consider the tenor of the note that in  fortyeight hours will be before the eyes of our friends abroad. There has been  reference to Ministers. We can say, now that M. de Nerval has left us, what do  we care for Ministers? We shall control them.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们磋商吧，先生们，”主席说，“不要再试图你说服我，我说服你了。考虑考虑记录的内容吧，四十八小时之后我们外面的朋友就要读到了。刚才谈到各部长。现在，德·奈瓦尔先生已经离开我们，我们可以这样说了，那些部长与我们有什么相干？他们将来还是要听我们的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Cardinal showed his approval by a delicate smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>红衣主教狡黠地笑笑，表示同意。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Nothing  easier, it seems to me, than to sum up our position,' said the young Bishop of  Agde with the concentrated and restrained fire of the most exalted fanaticism.  Hitherto he had remained silent; his eye, which Julien had watched, at first  mild and calm, had grown fiery after the first hour's discussion. Now his heart  overflowed like lava from Vesuvius.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我觉得，最容易的是概括我们的立场，”年轻的阿格德主教说，强压住一股由最激昂的狂热凝聚而成的烈火。他一直保持沉默，于连注意到他的眼睛从讨论一个钟头以后，就由温和平静一变而为烈焰飞腾。现在他的心灵简直如维苏威火山熔岩一样喷涌四溢了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'From  1806 to 1814, England made only one mistake,' he said, 'which was her not  dealing directly and personally with Napoleon. As soon as that man had created  Dukes and Chamberlains, as soon as he had restored the Throne, the mission that  God had entrusted to him was at an end; he was ripe only for destruction. The  Holy Scriptures teach us in more than one passage the way to make an end of  tyrants.' (Here followed several Latin quotations.)</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“从一八０四年到一八一四年，英国只犯了一个错误，”他说，“那就是没有对拿破仑采取直接的、个人的行动。这个人封公爵、内侍，重建帝位，至此，天主赋与他的使命已经完成；他除了被献作祭品之外，别无它用。《圣经》中不止一处教导我们如何消灭暴君。（接下来是好几段拉丁文引文。）</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Today,  Gentlemen, it is not a man that we must destroy; it is Paris.The  whole of France copies Paris. What is the use of arming your five hundred men  in each Department? A hazardous enterprise and one that will never end. What is  the use of involving France in a matter which is peculiar to Paris? Paris  alone, with her newspapers and her drawing rooms, has done the harm; let the  modern Babylon perish.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“今天，先生们，要献作祭品的不是一个人，而是整个巴黎。全法国都在模仿巴黎。在每个省武装你们那五百人有什么用？这是一件冒险的事情，而且没完没了。何必要把法国和巴黎自己的事情搅在一起呢？巴黎自己用它的报纸、它的客厅制造灾祸；让这个新巴比伦毁灭吧。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Between  the Altar and Paris, there must be a fight to the finish. This catastrophe is  indeed to the earthly advantage of the Throne. Why did not Paris dare to  breathe under Bonaparte? Ask the artillery of Saint Roch.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“在祭坛和巴黎之间，应该有个了结了。这场灾难甚至与王座的利益有关。为什么巴黎在波拿巴统治下竟大气也不敢出呢？去问问圣罗克大炮吧……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was not until three o'clock in the morning that Julien left the house with M.  de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>直到凌晨三点钟，于连才跟德·拉莫尔先生离开。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis was depressed and tired. For the first time, in speaking to Julien, he  used a tone of supplication. He asked him to promise never to disclose the  excesses of zeal, such was his expression, which he had chanced to witness. 'Do  not mention it to our friend abroad, unless he deliberately insists on knowing  the nature of our young hot-heads. What does it matter to them if the State be  overthrown? They will be Cardinals, and will take refuge in Rome. We, in our  country seats, shall be mas sacred by the peasants.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵感到羞耻，疲倦。他在跟于连说话的时候，生平第一次口气中有了恳求的味道。他要求于连保证绝不把他刚才碰巧见到的过分的狂热，这是他的原话，泄露出去。“不要告诉我们国外的朋友，除非他真地坚持要知道我们的这些年轻疯子的情况。政府被推翻关他们什么事？他们会当上红衣主教，躲到罗马去。我们呢，我们将在古堡里被农民杀死。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  secret note which the Marquis drafted from the long report of six and twenty  pages, written by Julien, was not ready until a quarter to five.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连做的会议记录长达二十六页，侯爵据此写成秘密记录，到四点三刻才完成。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am dead tired,' said the Marquis, 'and so much can be seen from this note,  which is lacking in precision towards the end; I am more dissatisfied with it  than with anything I ever did in my life. Now, my friend,' he went on, 'go and  lie down for a few hours, and for fear of your being abducted, I am going to  lock you into your room.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我累得要命，”侯爵说，“从这份记录的结尾部分缺乏明晰性就可以后出来；我一生做过的事情中，这一件最让我不满意了。好吧，我的朋友，”他补充说，“去休息几个钟头吧，为了防止有人劫持您，我把您锁在房间里。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next  day, the Marquis took Julien to a lonely mansion, at some distance from Paris.  They found there a curious company who, Julien decided, were priests. He was  given a passport which bore a false name, but did at last indicate the true  goal of his journey, of which he had always feigned ignorance. He started off  by himself in a calash.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>第二天，侯爵把于连带到一座离巴黎相当远的、孤零零的古堡里。那里面住着一些奇怪的人，于连认为是教士。他们给了他一本护照，用的是假名，但终于写明了旅行的真正目的地，其实他一直是假装不知道。他孤身一人登上一辆敞篷四轮马车。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis had no misgivings as to his memory, Julien had repeated the text of the  secret note to him several times; but he was greatly afraid of his being  intercepted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵对于连的记忆力毫不担心，那份秘密记录他已当面背过好几次，不过他担心的是于连被中途堵截。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Remember,  whatever you do, to look like a fop who is travelling to kill time,' was his  friendly warning, as Julien was leaving the room.'There  may perhaps have been several false brethren in our assembly last night.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“要特别注意，只可有出门旅行消磨时间的花花公子模样，”他在于连离开客厅时亲切地说，“在我们昨天的会议上，可能不止有一个假伙伴。”</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  journey was rapid and very tedious. Julien was barely out of the Marquis's  sight before he had forgotten both the secret note and his mission, and was  thinking of nothing but Mathilde's scorn.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>旅行迅速而凄凉。于连一离开侯爵，就把秘密记录和使命忘了，一心只想着玛蒂尔德的鄙视。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  a village, some leagues beyond Metz, the postmaster came to inform him that  there were no fresh horses. It was ten o'clock at night; Julien, greatly  annoyed, ordered supper. He strolled up and down outside the door and passed  unperceived into the stableyard. He saw no horses there.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在过了麦茨几法里的一个村子里，驿站长来对他说没有马。已经是晚上个点钟，于连很生气，让人准备晚餐。他在门前留达，趁人不注意，慢慢地步过马厩的院子，果然没有马。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  man had a singular expression all the same,' he said to himself;'his coarse eye  was scrutinising me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过那个人的神情很怪，”于连心想，“他那双粗鲁的眼睛老是打量我。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>We  can see that he was beginning not to believe literally everything that he was  told. He thought of making his escape after supper, and in the meanwhile, in  order to learn something of the lie of the land, left his room to go and warm  himself by the kitchen fire. What was his joy upon finding there Signor  Geronimo, the famous singer!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正如人们所看到的，他已经开始不相信他们对他说的话了，他考虑晚饭后溜走，为了了解一点当地的情况，他离开房间到厨房去烤火。真是喜出望外，他在那儿碰上了著名歌唱家热罗尼莫先生！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Comfortably  ensconced in an armchair which he had made them push up close to the fire, the  Neapolitan was groaning aloud and talking more,by himself, than the score of  German peasants who were gathered round him open-mouthed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>那不勒斯人坐在他让人搬到炉火前的一张扶手椅上，高声叹息，一个人说的话比张口结舌地围着他的那二十个德国农民还要多。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'These  people are ruining me,' he cried to Julien, 'I have promised to sing tomorrow  at Mayence. Seven Sovereign Princes have assembled there to hear me. But let us  take the air,' he added, in a significant tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这些人可把我毁了，”他朝于连嚷道，“我说好明天去美因兹演唱的。有七位君主赶去听我唱歌。我们还是出去进口气吧，”他意味深长地说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  he had gone a hundred yards along the road, and was well out of earshot:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他们在大路上走了百来步，说话不会被人听见了。</p>

</div></div>

<p>'Do  you know what is happening?' he said to Julien; 'this postmaster is a rogue. As  I was strolling about, I gave a franc to a little ragamuffin who told me  everything. There are more than a dozen horses in a stable at the other end of  the village. They mean to delay some courier.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您知道他搞的什么名堂吗？”他对于连说，“这个驿站长是个骗子，我在溜达的时候给了一个小顽童二十个苏，他什么都跟我说了。在村子另一头的马厩里有不下十二匹马。他们想拖住一个信使。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Indeed?'  said Julien, with an innocent air.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“真的吗？”于连装傻。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was not enough to have discovered the fraud, they must get on: this was what  Geronimo and his friend could not manage to do. 'We must wait for the  daylight,' the singer said finally, 'they are suspicious of us.Tomorrow  morning we shall order a good breakfast; while they are preparing it we go out  for a stroll, we escape, hire fresh horses, and reach the next post.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>发现了骗局还不算完，还得离开此地，这热罗尼莫和他的朋友可就办不到了，“等到天亮吧，”最后，歌唱家说，“他们怀疑我们了。他们要找的大概是您或者我。明天早晨我们要一份丰盛的早餐；在他们准备的时候，我们出去散步，趁机溜走；我们租两匹马，赶到下一个驿站。”·</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  your luggage?' said Julien, who thought that perhaps Geronimo himself might  have been sent to intercept him. It was time to sup and retire to bed. Julien  was still in his first sleep, when he was awakened with a start by the sound of  two people talking in his room, apparently quite unconcerned.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那您的行李呢？”于连说，他想也许热罗尼莫本人就是被派来拦截他的。该吃晚饭了，睡觉了。于连还在睡头一觉，突然被两个人说话的声音惊醒，他们倒不大顾忌什么。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  recognised the postmaster, armed with a dark lantern. Its light was  concentrated upon the carriagetrunk, which Julien had had carried up to his  room. With the postmaster was another man who was calmly going through the open  trunk. Julien could make out only the sleeves of his coat, which were black and  closefitting.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连认出了驿站长，提着一盏暗灯，灯光照向旅行箱，那是于连让人搬进房里的，驿站长身旁有一个人，正不慌不忙的翻箱子。于连只能看出那人衣服的袖子，黑色，很紧。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is a cassock,' he said to himself, and quietly seized the pocket pistols which  he had placed under his pillow.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是一件道袍，”他心想，轻轻地握住了放在枕下的两把小手枪。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  need not be afraid of his waking, Monsieur le Cure,' said the postmaster. 'The  wine we gave them was some of what you prepared yourself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不用担心，他不会醒，本堂神甫先生，”驿站长说。“给他们喝的酒是您亲自准备的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  can find no trace of papers,' replied the cure. 'Plenty of linen, oils, pomades  and fripperies; he is a young man of the world, occupied with his own  pleasures. The envoy will surely be the other, who pretends to speak with an  Italian accent.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我连文件的影子都没找到，”本堂神甫说，“内衣、香水、发蜡、乱七八糟的小东西倒不少；这是个寻欢作乐的当代青年。密使大概是另一个，他装作说话有意大利口音。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  men came up to Julien to search the pockets of his travelling coat.He  was strongly tempted to kill them as robbers. This could involve no dangerous  consequences. He longed to do it… 'I should be a mere fool,' he said to  himself, 'I should be endangering my mission.' After searching his coat, 'this  is no diplomat,' said the priest: he moved away, and wisely.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这两个人走近于连，在他的旅行装的口袋里搜寻，他真想把他们当小偷打死。绝不会有什么危险的后果。他真想……“那我可就成了个傻瓜了，”他心想，“我会坏了大事。”教士把他的衣服搜查完，说：“不是一个外交家，”他走了，幸亏走了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  he touches me in my bed, it will be the worse for him!' Julien was saying to  himself; 'he may quite well come and stab me, and that I will not allow.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果他到床上动我，让他倒霉！”于连心想，“他可能过来用匕首刺我，我岂能容他这么干。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  cure turned his head, Julien half-opened his eyes; what was his astonishment!  It was the abbe Castanede! And indeed, although the two men had tried to lower  their voices, he had felt, from the first, that he recognised the sound of one  of them. He was seized with a passionate desire to rid the world of one of its  vilest scoundrels …</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>本堂神甫转过头，于连半睁开眼睛，这一惊不小！原来是卡斯塔奈德神甫！其实，尽管那两个人想低声说话，他一开始就觉得一个声音很熟。于连突然被一种强烈的欲望攫住，正想把一个最卑鄙的流氓从大地上清除掉……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  my mission!' he reminded himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那我的使命呢！”他心想。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  priest and his acolyte left the room. A quarter of an hour later, Julien  pretended to awake. He called for help and roused the whole house.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>本堂神甫和他的同伙出去了。一刻钟以后，于连假装醒了。他叫人，把整座房子里的人都吵醒了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have been poisoned,' he cried, 'I am in horrible agony!' He wanted a pretext  for going to Geronimo's rescue. He found him half asphyxiated by the laudanum  that had been in his wine.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我中毒了，”他喊道，“我难受的要命！”他要有个借口去救热罗尼莫。他发现热罗尼尊已被酒里的阿片酊麻醉，处于半窒息状态。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien,  fearing some pleasantry of this kind, had supped upon chocolate which he had  brought with him from Paris. He could not succeed in arousing Geronimo  sufficiently to make him agree to leave the place.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连早就担心此类玩笑，晚饭时喝的是从巴黎带来的巧克力。他没有能把热罗尼莫完全叫醒，劝不动他下决心离开。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Though  you offered me the whole Kingdom of Naples,' said the singer, 'I would not  forgo the pleasure of sleep at this moment.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“就是把整个那不勒斯王国给我，”歌唱家说，“我此刻也不会放弃睡觉的快乐。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  the seven Sovereign Princes!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那七位君主呢？”</p>

</div></div>

<p>Julien  set off alone and arrived without further incident at the abode of the eminent  personage. He spent a whole morning in vainly soliciting an audience.  Fortunately, about four o'clock, the Duke decided to take the air. Julien saw  him leave the house on foot, and had no hesitation in going up to him and  begging for alms. When within a few feet of the eminent personage, he drew out  the Marquis de La Mole's watch, and flourished it ostentatiously. 'Follow me at  distance,' said the other, without looking at him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连一个人走了，再没有出什么事，就到了那位大人物的住处。他花了一个上午求见，没有成功。也巧，快到四点钟时，公爵想透透气。于连看见他步行出来，毫不犹豫地走上前去，请求施舍。离大人物两步远的时候，他掏出德·拉莫尔侯爵的表，有意让他看见。“远远地跟着我，”那人对他说，并不看他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  walking for a quarter of a league, the Duke turned abruptly in to a little  Kaffeehaus. It was in a bedroom of this humblest form of inn that Julien had  the honour of reciting his four pages to the Duke. When he had finished: 'Begin  again, and go more slowly,' he was told.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>走了四分之一法里，公爵突然进了一家小咖啡馆。在这个最下等的客栈的一个房间里，于连荣幸地把那四页东西背给公爵听。背过一遍，那人对他说：“再背一遍，慢—些。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Prince took down notes. 'Go on foot to the next post. Leave your luggage and  your calash here. Make your way to Strasbourg as best you can, and on the  twenty-second of the month'—it was now the tenth—'be in this coffeehouse here  at half past twelve. Do not leave here for half an hour. Silence!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>亲王做了记录。“步行到邻近的驿站。把您的行李和马车丢在这里，尽可能到斯特拉斯堡去，本月二十二日（当天是十日）中午十二点半到这个咖啡馆来。半个钟头以后再出去。别说话！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Such  were the only words that Julien heard said. They sufficed to fill him with the  deepest admiration. 'It is thus,' he thought, 'that one handles affairs; what  would this great statesman say if he had heard those hot-headed chatter boxes  three days ago?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连听见的就是这么几句话。这几句话已经足以让他佩服得五体投地了。“处理大事就是这样啊，”他想，“这位大政治家如果听见三天前那些狂热的饶舌者说的话，该怎么说呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  took two days to reach Strasbourg, he felt that there was nothing for him to do  there. He made a wide circuit. 'If that devil, the abbe Castanede has  recognised me, he is not the man to be easily shaken off … And what a joy to  him to make a fool of me, and to spoil my mission!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连用了两天工夫才到了斯特拉斯堡，他觉得去那几无事可做，就绕了个大弯子。“如果卡斯塔奈德这鬼神甫认出我来，他可不是轻易失去我的踪迹的那种人……要是能嘲弄我，让我的使命失败，他该多高兴啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe Castanede, Chief of Police to the Congregation along the whole of the  Northern frontier, had mercifully not recognised him. And the Jesuits of  Strasbourg, albeit most zealous, never thought of keeping an eye on Julien,  who, with his Cross and his blue greatcoat, had the air of a young soldier  greatly concerned with his personal appearance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>卡斯塔奈德神甫幸好没认出他，他是圣会在整个北部边境上秘密警察的头目。斯特拉斯堡的耶稣会士虽然很热心，却根本想不到监视于连。于连佩戴十字勋章，穿着蓝色的常礼服，俨然一位一门心思修饰自己的年轻军宫。
