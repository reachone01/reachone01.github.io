<p>But  let us leave this little man to his little fears; why has he taken into his  house a man of feeling, when what he required was the soul of a flunkey? Why  does he not know how to select his servants? The ordinary procedure of the  nineteenth century is that when a powerful and noble personage encounters a man  of feeling, he kills, exiles, imprisons or so humiliates him that the other, like  a fool, dies of grief. In this instance it so happens that it is not yet the  man of feeling who suffers. The great misfortune of the small towns of France  and of elected governments, like that of New York, is an inability to forget  that there exist in the world persons like M. de Renal. In a town of twenty  thousand inhabitants, these men form public opinion, and public opinion is a  terrible force in a country that has the Charter. A man endowed with a noble  soul, of generous instincts, who would have been your friend did he not live a  hundred leagues away, judges you by the public opinion of your town, which is  formed by the fools whom chance has made noble, rich and moderate. Woe to him  who distinguishes himself!</p>

<div class="right">
<p>不过，我们还是让这个微不足道的人留在他那些微不足道的忧虑中吧；谁让他需要的是奴性却把一个勇者弄到家里去呢？他怎么就不善择人呢？十九世纪的惯例是，一个有权势的贵族若遇上一个勇者，即杀之，逐之，囚之或辱之，使之傻得居然痛苦而死。幸好这里痛不欲生的并非勇者。法国的小城和众多如纽约那祥的民选政府的最大不幸乃是不能忘记世界上还存在着德·莱纳先生那样的人。在一个两万人的城市里，是这些人制造舆论，而在一个拥有宪章的国家里，舆论是可怕的。一个高尚宽洪的人，可能是您的朋友，但他住在百里之外，就只能根据您住的那个城市的舆论来判断您，而舆论恰恰是那些碰巧生下来就成为富有稳健的贵族傻瓜们制造的。谁出头谁倒霉！</p>

<p>Immediately  after dinner, they set off again for Vergy; but, two days later, Julien saw the  whole family return to Verrieres.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>午饭后，他们立刻回韦尔吉了；可是过了一天，于连看见他们全家又回到维里埃。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>An  hour had not gone by before, greatly to his surprise, he discovered that Madame  de Renal was making a mystery of something. She broke off her conversations  with her husband as soon as he appeared, and seemed almost to wish him to go  away. Julien did not wait to be told twice. He became cold and reserved; Madame  de Renal noticed this, and did not seek an explanation. 'Is she going to  provide me with a successor?' thought Julien. 'Only the day before yesterday,  she was so intimate with me! But they say that this is how great ladies behave.  They are like kings, no one receives so much attention as the minister who, on  going home, finds the letter announcing his dismissal.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个钟头不到，于连就发现德·莱纳夫人有什么事情瞒着他，不禁大为惊讶。他—出现，她就中断了丈夫的谈话，好像还希望他走开。于  连不用她表示第二次，他变得冷淡而持重；德·莱纳夫人看出来了，但并不想问他。“难道她要找一个接替我的人了吗？”于连想。“前天她还跟我那么亲密！有人说这些贵妇人就是如此行事。简直像国王一样，一个大臣刚刚还是恩宠尤加，回到家里却收到一封信，宣布他已失宠。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  remarked that in these conversations, which ceased abruptly on his approach, there  was frequent mention of a big house belonging to the municipality of Verrieres,  old, but large and commodious, and situated opposite the church, in the most  valuable quarter of the town. 'What connection can there be between that house  and a new lover?' Julien asked himself. In his distress of mind, he repeated to  himself those charming lines of Francois I, which seemed to him new, because it  was not a month since Madame de Renal had taught them to him. At that time, by  how many vows, by how many caresses had not each line been proved false!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连注意到，在这些他一走近便要戛然而止的谈话中，常提到一座属维里埃市所有的大房子，房子很老，但是宽大、舒适，面对教堂，地处最繁华的商业区。“这座房子和一个新情人之间有什么共同点呢？”于连自语道，忧伤中，他反复吟涌弗朗索瓦一世①的美丽诗句。他觉得这两行诗很新鲜，因为德·莱纳夫人教给他还不到一个月。当时，这两行诗的每一行都受到他多少誓言和多少抚爱的驳斥啊！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Souvent  femme varie Bien fol est qui s'y fie.</p>

<div class="right">

<p>女人心常变，傻瓜信为真。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Renal set off by post for Besancon. This journey was decided upon at two  hours' notice, he seemed greatly troubled. On his return, he flung a large  bundle wrapped in grey paper on the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生乘驿车去贝藏松了。这次旅行是两个钟头内决定的，他显得很苦恼，回来时，他把一个用灰纸包着的大包裹扔在桌子上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  much for that stupid business,' he said to his wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这就是那件蠢事，”他对妻子说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>An  hour later, Julien saw the billsticker carrying off this large bundle; he  followed him hastily. 'I shall learn the secret at the first street corner.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个钟头以后，于连看见贴布告的人拿走了那个大包裹；他急忙跟上去。“我在头一个街角就能知道这个秘密。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  waited impatiently behind the billsticker, who with his fat brush was slapping  paste on the back of the bill. No sooner was it in its place than Julien's  curiosity read on it the announcement in full detail of the sale by public  auction of the lease of that large and old house which recurred so frequently  in M. de Renal's conversations with his wife. The assignation was announced for  the following day at two o'clock, in the town hall, on the extinction of the  third light. Julien was greatly disappointed; he considered the interval to be  rather short: how could all the possible bidders come to know of the sale in  time? But apart from this, the bill, which was dated a fortnight earlier and  which he read from beginning to end in three different places, told him nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连焦急地在贴布告的人身后等着，那人用大刷子在布告背面刷满浆糊。于连很好奇，布告刚贴好，他就看见上面的一则通告，很详细，  说的是用公开招标的方式出租德·莱纳先生和他妻子的谈话中经常提到的那座又大又老的房子。出租招标定在次日两点钟，在市政府大厅，以第三支蜡烛熄灭为时限。于连很失望，他的确觉得时间有点短：如何能有时间通知到所有的竞争者呢？再说，布告是十五天前签署的，他在三个地方仔细看过全文，看布告是看不出什么名堂的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  went to inspect the vacant house. The porter, who did not see him approach, was  saying mysteriously to a friend:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他去看那座待租的房子。门房没看见他走近，对一个邻居神秘地说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Bah!  It's a waste of time. M. Maslon promised him he should have it for three  hundred francs; and as the Mayor kicked, he was sent to the Bishop's Palace, by  the Vicar-General de Frilair.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“哼！哼！白费劲儿！马斯隆先生断言他用三百法郎就能租下来；市长还顶牛，结果被代理主教福利莱召到主教府去了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  appearance on the scene seemed greatly to embarrass the two cronies, who did  not say another word.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的到来似乎使两个朋友大感不便，他们不再多说一句话了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  did not fail to attend the auction. There was a crowd of people in an  ill-lighted room; but everyone eyed his neighbours in a singular fashion. Every  eye was fixed on a table, where Julien saw, on a pewter plate, three lighted  candle ends. The crier was shouting: 'Three hundred francs, gentlemen!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连岂能错过这次出租招标。阴暗的大厅里人很多，人人都以一种奇怪的方式互相打量着。所有的眼睛都盯着一张桌子，桌上一个锡盘，  锡盘上点着三支蜡烛。执达吏喊道：“先生们，三百法郎！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Three  hundred francs! It is too bad!' one man murmured to another.Julien  was standing between them. 'It is worth more than eight hundred; I am going to  cover the bid.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“三百法郎！这太过份了，”一个人低声对旁边的人说。于连正好在他们俩中间。“这值八百多法郎，我要出更高的价。”</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It's  cutting off your nose to spite your face. What are you going to gain by  bringing M. Maslon, M. Valenod, the Bishop, his terrible Vicar-General de  Frilair and the whole of their gang down upon you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“你这是自讨苦吃。你跟马斯隆先生、瓦勒诺先生、主教、可怕的福利莱代理主教还有他们一伙作对，有什么好处？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Three  hundred and twenty,' the other shouted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“三百二十法郎，”那一位喊道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Stupid  idiot!' retorted his neighbour. 'And here's one of the Mayor's spies,' he added  pointing at Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“大傻瓜！”这人应道，“这儿正有一个市长的密探，”他指了指于连，补了一句。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  turned sharply to rebuke him for this speech; but the two Franc Comtois paid no  attention to him. Their coolness restored his own. At this moment the last  candle end went out, and the drawling voice of the crier assigned the house for  a lease of nine years to M. de Saint Giraud, chief secretary at the Prefecture  of ——, and for three hundred and thirty francs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连猛地回过头，想跟说这话的人算帐；然而两位弗朗什—孔泰人根本不再理会他了。他们冷静，他也就冷静了。这时，第三支蜡烛灭了  ，执达吏用拖长的声调宣布房子租给某省科长德·圣吉罗先生，为期九年，租金是三百三十法郎。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  soon as the Mayor had left the room, the discussion began.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>市长一走出大厅，人们就嚷嚷开了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That's  thirty francs Grogeot's imprudence has earned for the town,' said one.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“格罗诺的冒失给市府挣了三十法郎，”一个人说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  M. de Saint Giraud,' came the answer, 'will have his revenge on Grogeot, he  will pass it on.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“但是德·圣吉罗先生，”一个人答道，“会报复格罗诺的，够他受的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a scandal,' said a stout man on Julien's left: 'a house for which I'd have  given, myself, eight hundred francs as a factory, and then it would have been a  bargain.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“多么卑鄙！”于连左边的一个胖子说，“这座房子，我可以为我的工厂花八百法郎租下来，而且我还觉得便宜呢。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Bah!'  replied a young Liberal manufacturer, 'isn't M. de Saint Giraud one of the  Congregation? Haven't his four children all got bursaries? Poor man! The town  of Verrieres is simply bound to increase his income with an allowance of five  hundred francs; that is all.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“哼！”一个年轻的制造商、自由党人答道，“德·圣吉罗先生不是圣会的吗？他的四个孩子不是都领助学金吗？可怜的人！维里埃市又  得多发他五百法郎的补助了，就是这么回事。”</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  to think that the Mayor hasn't been able to stop it!' remarked a third. 'For he  may be an Ultra, if you like, but he's not a thief.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“市长居然未能阻止！”第三个人说，“他是极端保王党，一点不错：但是他不偷。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He's  not a thief?' put in another; 'it's a regular thieves' kitchen.Everything  goes into a common fund, and is divided up at the end of the year. But there's  young Sorel; let us get away.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他不偷？”另一个人说，“他不偷谁偷！都装在一个公共的大钱袋里啦，年终瓜分。小索莱尔在这里，咱们走吧。”</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  went home in the worst of tempers; he found Madame de Renal greatly depressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连回去了，情绪恶劣，他看见德·莱纳夫人也愁眉不展。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Have  you come from the sale?' she said to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您去看招标了？”她问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  Ma'am, where I had the honour to be taken for the Mayor's spy.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，夫人，我在那里荣幸地被视为市长先生的密探。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  he had taken my advice, he would have gone away somewhere.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他如果听我的，就该去旅行。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  that moment, M. de Renal appeared; he was very sombre. Dinner was eaten in  silence. M. de Renal told Julien to accompany the children to Vergy; they  travelled in unbroken gloom. Madame de Renal tried to comfort her husband.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，德·莱纳先生来了，沉着脸。吃晚饭时没有一个人说话；德·莱纳先生吩咐于连随孩子们回韦尔吉，旅途颇愁闷。德·莱纳夫人安慰她丈夫：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Surely  you are accustomed to it, my dear.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您也该习惯了，我的朋友。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  evening, they were seated in silence round the domestic hearth; the crackle of  the blazing beech logs was their sole distraction. It was one of those moments  of depression which are to be found in the most united families. One of the  children uttered a joyful cry.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>晚上，大家围坐在炉子周围，谁也不说话；唯一的消遣是听燃烧的山毛榉柴噼啪作响。这是最和睦的家庭都会遇到的那种愁闷时刻。一个  孩子快活地叫起来：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There's  the bell! The bell!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有人拉门铃！有人拉门铃！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Egad,  if it's M. de Saint Giraud come to get hold of me, on the excuse of thanking  me, I shall give him a piece of my mind; it's too bad. It's Valenod that he has  to thank, and it is I who am compromised. What am I going to say if those  pestilent Jacobin papers get hold of the story, and make me out a M. Nonante  Cinq?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“见鬼！如果是德·圣吉罗先生以道谢为由来纠缠，”市长叹道，“我就对他不客气；这也太过分了。他该谢的是瓦勒诺，我还是受牵连  的呢。这件事要是被那些该死的雅各宾派报纸抓住，把我写成一个诺南特一—散克先生，我又能说什么呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  good-looking man, with bushy black whiskers, entered the room at this moment in  the wake of the servant.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时一个极漂亮的蓄着黑黑的大连腮胡的人，跟着仆人进来</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'M.  le Maire, I am Signor Geronimo. Here is a letter which M. le Chevalier de  Beauvaisis, attache at the Embassy at Naples, gave me for you when I came away;  it is only nine days ago,' Signor Geronimo added, with a sprightly air, looking  at Madame de Renal. 'Signor de Beauvaisis, your cousin, and my good friend,  Madame, tells me that you know Italian.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“市长先生，我是热罗尼莫先生。这里有一封信，是那不勒斯大使的随员博威齐骑士在我动身前交我带给您的；”热罗尼莫先生神情愉快  ，又望着德·莱纳夫人说：“九天前，夫人，您的表兄我的好友博威齐先生说您会说意大利语。”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  good humour of the Neapolitan changed this dull evening into one that was  extremely gay. Madame de Renal insisted upon his taking supper. She turned the  whole house upside down; she wished at all costs to distract Julien's thoughts  from the description of him as a spy which twice in that day he had heard  ringing in his ear. Signer Geronimo was a famous singer, a man used to good  company, and at the same time the best of company himself, qualities which, in  France, have almost ceased to be compatible. He sang after supper a little duet  with Madame de Renal. He told charming stories. At one o'clock in the morning  the children protested when Julien proposed that they should go to bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那不勒斯人的好兴致一下子使这个愁闷的夜晚变得欢乐愉快。德·莱纳夫人一定要请他吃夜宵。她让全家人都动起来了，她无论如何要让于连忘掉一天之内在他耳朵响过两次的那个密探的称呼。热罗尼莫先生是个有名的歌唱家，很有教养，又很快活，在法国，这两种品质已不大能并存了。夜宵后，他和德·莱纳夫人唱了段二重唱。他讲的故事也很迷人。凌晨一点钟，于连让孩子们去睡觉，他们都嚷嚷起来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Just  this story,' said the eldest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“再讲一个故事，”老大说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is my own, Signorino,' replied Signer Geronimo. 'Eight years ago I was, like  you, a young scholar in the Conservatorio of Naples, by which I mean that I was  your age; for I had not the honour to be the son of the eminent Mayor of the  beautiful town of Verrieres.' <p>This allusion drew a sigh from M. de Renal, who  looked at his wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是我自己的故事，少爷，”热罗尼莫说。“八年前，我像你们一样是那不勒斯音乐学院的一个年轻学生，我的意思是说像你们一样大  ；但是，我可没有这个荣幸，做美丽的维里埃市市长的儿子。</p>
<p>这句话让德·莱纳先生叹了口气，他望了望妻子。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Signer  Zingarelli,' went on the young singer, speaking with a slightly exaggerated  accent which made the children burst out laughing, 'Signor Zingarelli is an  exceedingly severe master. He is not loved at the Conservatorio; but he makes  them act always as though they loved him. I escaped whenever I could; I used to  go to the little theatre of San Carlino,where I used to hear music fit for the  gods: but, O heavens, how was I to scrape together the eight soldi which were  the price of admission to the pit? An enormous sum,' he said, looking at the  children, and the children laughed again. 'Signer Giovannone, the Director of  San Carlino, heard me sing. I was sixteen years old. &quot;This boy is a  treasure,&quot; he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“赞卡莱利先生，”年轻的歌唱家继续说，稍微夸大了他的口音，逗得孩子们哈哈大笑，“赞卡莱利先生是一个极其严厉的老师。学院里  大家都不喜欢他，可是他希望大家一举一动都仿佛喜欢他似的。我是能出校门就出校门，我去圣卡利诺小剧场，在那里可以听到天仙般的音乐：但是，天哪！我怎么才能凑足八个苏买一张正厅的座呢？这可不是一笔小数目呀，”他看了看孩子们，孩子们笑了。“乔瓦诺先生，圣卡利诺小剧场的经理，听我唱歌。那时我十六岁，他说：‘这孩子可是个宝贝呀。’</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;Would  you like me to engage you, my friend?&quot; he said to me one day.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>“‘你原意我雇你吗，亲爱的朋友？’他来对我说。</p>

<p>“‘您给我多少钱？’</p>

</div></div>

<p>'Precisely,  young Sir. Signor Giovannone said to me: &quot;First of all, caro, a little  agreement.&quot; I signed the paper: he gave me three ducats. I had never seen  so much money. Then he told me what I must do.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>'Next  day, I demanded an interview with the terrible Signer Zingarelli.His  old servant showed me into the room.</p>

<div class="right">

<p>“第二天，我求见可怕的赞卡莱利先生。他的老仆人让我进去。</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;What  do you want with me, you scapegrace?&quot; said Zingarelli.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“‘找我干什么，坏小子？’赞卡莱利说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;Maestro&quot;  I told him, &quot;I repent of my misdeeds; never again will I break out of the  Conservatorio by climbing over the iron railings. I am going to study twice as  hard.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“‘老师！’我说，‘我对我的过失感到后悔，我再也不翻铁栏杆离开学院了。我要加倍努力学习。’</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;If  I were not afraid of spoiling the finest bass voice I have ever heard, I should  lock you up on bread and water for a fortnight, you scoundrel.&quot;</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;Maestro&quot;  I went on, &quot;I am going to be a model to the whole school, credete a me.  But I ask one favour of you, if anyone comes to ask for me to sing outside,  refuse him. Please say that you cannot allow it.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“‘老师，’我说，‘我将成为全院的榜样，请相信我。但是我向您求一个恩典，如果有人来求我到外面唱歌，替我拒绝他。求求您，说  您不能同意。’</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;And  who do you suppose is going to ask for a good for nothing like you? Do you  think I shall ever allow you to leave the Conservatorio? Do you wish to make a  fool of me? Off with you, off with you!&quot; he said, aiming a kick at my  hindquarters, &quot;or it will be bread and water in a cell.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“‘见鬼，谁会要您这样一个坏蛋？难道我会允许你离开音乐学院吗？你想取笑我吗？滚！滚！’他一边说一边要朝我屁股上踢一脚，‘不然的话，当心去啃干面包蹲监狱。’</p>

<p>'An  hour later, Signer Giovannone came to call on the Director.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一小时以后，乔瓦尼先生到院长家：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;I  have come to ask you to make my fortune,&quot; he began, &quot;let me have  Geronimo. If he sings in my theatre this winter I give my daughter in  marriage.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“‘我来求您成全我，’他对他说，‘把热罗尼莫给我吧。让他到我的剧场去唱歌，今年冬天我就能嫁女儿了。’</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;What  do you propose to do with the rascal?&quot; Zingarelli asked him. &quot;I won't  allow it. You shan't have him; besides, even if I consented, he would never be  willing to leave the Conservatorio; he's just told me so himself.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“‘您要这个坏蛋干什么？’赞卡莱利对他说，‘我不愿意，您得不到他，再说，就是我同意，他也不会离开音乐学院的，他刚对我发过  誓。’</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'&quot;If  his willingness is all that matters,&quot; said Giovannone gravely, producing  my agreement from his pocket, &quot;carta canta! Here is his signature.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“‘如果只关系到他的个人意愿，’乔瓦尼严肃地说，一边从口袋里掏出我的合同，‘歌唱合同！这是他的签字。’</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Immediately  Zingarelli, furious, flew to the bell rope: <p>&quot;Turn Geronimo out of the  Conservatorio,&quot; he shouted, seething with rage. So out they turned me, I  splitting my sides with laughter. That same evening, I sang the aria del  Moltiplico. Polichinelle intends to marry, and counts up on his fingers the  different things he will need for the house, and loses count afresh at every  moment.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“赞卡莱利勃然大怒，一个劲儿地摇铃叫人：</p>

<p>‘把热罗尼莫赶出音乐学院！’他叫道，暴跳如雷。就这样，我被赶出来了，可我哈哈大笑。当天晚上，我唱了一首莫蒂普利科咏叹调。  小丑想结婚，掰着指头计算成家需要的东西，老是算不清楚。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  won't you, Sir, please sing us that air?' said Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！先生，请您给我们唱唱这支咏叹调吧，”德·莱纳夫人说。</p>


</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Geronimo  sang, and his audience all cried with laughter.Signor  Geronimo did not go to bed until two in the morning, leaving the family  enchanted with his good manners, his obliging nature and his gay spirits.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>热罗尼莫唱了，大家笑得眼泪都出来了。直到凌晨两点钟，热罗尼莫先生才去睡觉，他的优雅的举止、他的快活与随和，迷住了这家人。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next  day M. and Madame de Renal gave him the letters which he required for the  French Court.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天，德·莱纳先生和德·莱纳夫人给了他几封入宫所需要的介绍信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  so, falsehood everywhere,' said Julien. 'There is Signor Geronimo on his way to  London with a salary of sixty thousand francs. But for the cleverness of the  Director of San Carlino, his divine voice might not have been known and admired  for another ten years, perhaps… Upon my soul, I would rather be a Geronimo than  a Renal. He is not so highly honoured in society, but he has not the  humiliation of having to grant leases like that one today, and his is a merry  life.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这么说，到处都有虚假，”于连说，“看看热罗尼莫先生，他要去伦敦接受一个薪俸六万法郎的工作。没有丝卡利诺剧场的经理的手腕  ，他那神奇的声音也许晚十年才能为人所知和欣赏……真的，我宁肯做热罗尼莫而不做莱纳。他在社会上不那么尊贵，但他没有像今天的招标那样的烦恼，而且他的生活是快乐的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  thing astonished Julien: the weeks of solitude spent at Verrieres, in M. de  Renal's house, had been for him a time of happiness. He had encountered disgust  and gloomy thoughts only at the dinners to which he had been invited; in that  empty house, was he not free to read, write, meditate, undisturbed? He had not  been aroused at every moment from his radiant dreams by the cruel necessity of  studying the motions of a base soul, and that in order to deceive it by  hypocritical words or actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一件事情使于连感到惊奇：在维里埃德·莱纳先生的房子里度过的寂寞的几星期，对他来说竟成了一段幸福的时光。他只是在人家邀请他参加的宴会上才感到厌恶，才有令人不快的想法。在这座寂寞的房子里，他不是可以读、写、思考而不受打扰吗？他可以沉入非非之想而不必时时研究一颗卑鄙灵魂的活动并用虚伪的言或行去对付。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Could  happiness be thus within my reach? … The cost of such a life is nothing; I can,  as I choose, marry Miss Elisa, or become Fouque's partner … But the traveller  who has just climbed a steep mountain, sits down on the summit, and finds a  perfect pleasure in resting. Would he be happy if he were forced to rest  always?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“难道幸福离我这么近吗？……这样的生活所需甚少；我可以选择，或者娶爱丽莎，或者与富凯合伙……一个旅行者爬上一座陡峭的山峰，坐在山顶休息，其乐无穷。可要是强迫他永远休息，他会感到幸福吗？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal's mind was a prey to carking thoughts. In spite of her resolve to the  contrary, she had revealed to Julien the whole business of the lease. 'So he  will make me forget all my vows!' she thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人的脑子里有了一些死缠着她不放的念头。她下过决心，但还是把招标的内幕向于连合盘托出。“这么一来，他会让我忘记我的所有誓言！”她想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  would have given her life without hesitation to save that of her husband, had  she seen him in peril. Hers was one of those noble and romantic natures, for  which to see the possibility of a generous action, and not to perform it gives  rise to a remorse almost equal to that which one feels for a past crime.  Nevertheless, there were dreadful days on which she could not banish the  thought of the absolute happiness which she would enjoy, if, suddenly left a  widow, she were free to marry Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>如果她看见她丈夫处于危险之中，她会毫不犹豫地牺牲自己的生命去救他。这是一颗高尚而浪漫的灵魂，对她来说，可为宽厚而不为，乃是悔恨之源，与犯罪的悔恨无异。可是也有一些不样的日子，她不能驱散那幅她细细品味的极度幸福的图景：她突然成了寡妇，她可以和于连成为夫妻了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  loved her children far more than their father; in spite of his strict  discipline, he was adored by them. She was well aware that, if she married  Julien, she would have to leave this Vergy whose leafy shade was so dear to  her. She pictured herself living in Paris, continuing to provide her sons with  that education at which everyone marvelled. Her children, she herself, Julien,  all perfectly happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连爱她的孩子们，远胜过他们的父亲；他管教严格但是公正，所以仍然获得他们的爱戴。她清楚地感觉到，她若和于连结婚，就得离开维里埃，尽管她那么喜欢它的绿荫。她看见了自己生活在巴黎，继续给孩子们人人称赞的教育。孩子们，她，于连，都得到了圆满的幸福。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  strange effect of marriage, such as the nineteenth century has made it! The  boredom of married life inevitably destroys love, when love has preceded  marriage. And yet, as a philosopher has observed, it speedily brings about,  among people who are rich enough not to have to work, an intense boredom with  all quiet forms of enjoyment. And it is only dried up hearts, among women, that  it does not predispose to love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>十九世纪所造成的婚姻的结果，竟是这样奇特！爱情先于婚姻，那么对婚后生活的厌倦肯定毁灭爱情。然而，一位哲学家会说，在富裕得不必工作的人那里，对婚后生活的厌倦很快带来对平静快乐的厌倦。而在女人中，只有那些干枯的心灵才不会因厌倦而陷入情网。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  philosopher's observation makes me excuse Madame de Renal, but there was no  excuse for her at Verrieres, and the whole town, without her suspecting it, was  exclusively occupied with the scandal of her love. Thanks to this great scandal,  people that autumn were less bored than usual.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>哲学家的思考使我原谅了德·莱纳夫人，然而维里埃人不原谅她；她没有想到，全城的人都在议论她的爱情丑闻，由于出了这件大事，今年秋天过得比往年秋天少了些烦闷。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  autumn, the first weeks of winter had soon come and gone. It was time to leave  the woods of Vergy. The high society of Verrieres began to grow indignant that  its anathemas were making so little impression upon M. de Renal. In less than a  week, certain grave personages who made up for their habitual solemnity by  giving themselves the pleasure of fulfilling missions of this sort, implanted  in him the most cruel suspicions, but without going beyond the most measured  terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>秋天，还有冬天的一部分，很快就过去了。该离开韦尔吉的森林了。维里埃的上流社会开始愤怒了，因为他们的批评对德·莱纳先生的影响居然如此之少。不到一星期，以完成此类任务取乐来减少平时之严肃的正人君子们便让他起了最残酷的疑心，然而他们使用的词句却最审慎不过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  Valenod, who was playing a close game, had placed Elisa with a noble and highly  respected family, which included five women. Elisa fearing, she said, that she  might not find a place during the winter, had asked this family for only about  two thirds of what she was receiving at the Mayor's. Of her own accord, the  girl had the excellent idea of going to confess to the retired cure Chelan as  well as to the new cure, so as to be able to give them both a detailed account  of Julien's amours.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>瓦勒诺先生做得滴水不漏，把爱丽莎安置在—个颇受尊敬的贵族人家，这家里有五个女人。爱丽莎只要求略当市长家三分之二的工钱，她自己说是因为担心冬天找不到工作。她自己还有一个绝妙的主意，同时去谢朗本堂神甫和新本堂神甫那里去做忏悔，以便向他们两个人细细地讲述于连的爱情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the morning after his return, at six o'clock, the abbe Chelan sent for Julien:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连回来的第二天，早晨六钟点，谢朗神甫就遣人把他叫去：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  ask you nothing,' he said to him; 'I beg you, and if need be order you to tell  me nothing, I insist that within three days you leave either for the Seminary  at Besancon or for the house of your friend Fouque, who is still willing to  provide a splendid career for you. I have foreseen and settled everything, but  you must go, and not return to Verrieres for a year.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不问您什么，”他对他说，“我只是请求您，必要的话，我命令您什么也不要对我说；我要求您必须三日内前往贝藏松神学院，或者  去您的朋友富凯处。他一直准备为您安排一个美好的前程。我什么都预见到了，也什么都安排好了，您必须走，一年以内不要回维里埃。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  made no answer; he was considering whether his honour ought to take offence at  the arrangements which M. Chelan, who after all was not his father, had made  for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连没有回答，他捉摸谢朗先生对他的关心是否有损他的名誉，他究竟不是他的父亲。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Tomorrow  at this hour I shall have the honour of seeing you again,' he said at length to  the cure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“明日此刻，我将有幸再见到您，”最后他对本堂神甫说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  Chelan, who reckoned upon overcoming the young man by main force, spoke  volubly. His attitude, his features composed in the utmost humility, Julien did  not open his mouth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>谢朗先生想用大力制服这个如此年轻的人，说了很多。于连裹在最谦卑的态度和表情里，始终不开口。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  length he made his escape, and hastened to inform Madame de Renal, whom he  found in despair. Her husband had just been speaking to her with a certain  frankness. The natural weakness of his character, seeking encouragement in the  prospect of the inheritance from Besancon, had made him decide to regard her as  entirely innocent. He had just confessed to her the strange condition in which  he found public opinion at Verrieres. The public were wrong, had been led  astray by envious ill wishers, but what was to be done?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他终于走了，立刻跑去告诉德·莱纳夫人，却发现她已陷入绝望。她丈夫刚刚相当坦率地跟她谈了。他天生性格软弱，又对来自贝藏松的  遗产抱有希望，这终于使他认为她完全地清白无辜。他刚才向她承认，他发现维里埃的舆论处在一种奇怪的状态之中。公众错了，被嫉妒者引入歧途，可究竟该怎么办呢？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal had the momentary illusion that Julien might be able to accept M.  Valenod's offer, and remain at Verrieres. But she was no longer the simple,  timid woman of the previous year; her fatal passion, her spells of remorse had  enlightened her. Soon she had to bear the misery of proving to herself, while  she listened to her husband, that a separation, at any rate for the time being,  was now indispensable. 'Away from me, Julien will drift back into those  ambitious projects that are so natural when one has nothing. And I, great God!  I am so rich, and so powerless to secure my own happiness! He will forget me.  Charming as he is, he will be loved, he will love. Ah, unhappy woman! Of what  can I complain? Heaven is just, I have not acquired merit by putting a stop to  my crime; it blinds my judgment. It rested with me alone to win over Elisa with  a bribe, nothing would have been easier. I did not take the trouble to reflect  for a moment, the wild imaginings of love absorbed all my time. And now I  perish.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人曾有过瞬间的幻想，于连接受瓦勒诺先生的聘请，留在维里埃。然而这已不是去年那个单纯羞怯的女人了；她的致命的激情、她的悔恨已使她变得聪明。她听着丈夫讲，很快便痛苦地确认，一次至少是暂时的别离不可避免。“离开我以后，于连会再度坠入他那野心勃勃的计划中去，对于一无所有的人来说，这些计划是那样地自然。可我呢，伟大的天主啊！我这样富有，可是对我的幸福又这样地无用！他会忘掉我的。他那么可爱，会有人爱他，他也会爱别人。啊！不幸的女人……我有什么可抱怨的呢？苍天是公正的，我未能中止罪恶，将功补过，苍天剥夺了我的判断力。我本可以用钱收买爱丽莎，这是再容易不过的事了。我甚至不肯想一想，爱情产生的疯狂的想象占去了我全部的时间。我完了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One  thing struck Julien; as he conveyed to Madame de Renal the terrible news of his  departure, he was met with no selfish objection.Evidently  she was making an effort not to cry.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>有一件事使于连感到震惊，他把离别的可怕消息告诉德·莱纳夫人，居然没有遭到任何自私的反对。看得出来，她竭力克制，不让自己哭出来。</p>
</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'We  require firmness, my friend.'</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她剪下一缕头发。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  do not know what is to become of me,' she said to him, 'but if I die, promise  me that you will never forget my children. Far or near, try to make them grow  up honourable men. If there is another revolution, all the nobles will be  murdered, their father may emigrate, perhaps, because of that peasant who was  killed upon a roof. Watch over the family…Give  me your hand. Farewell, my friend! These are our last moments together. This  great sacrifice made, I hope that in public I shall have the courage to think  of my reputation.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不知道我将来会怎么样，”她说，“但是，如果我死了，答应我永远不忘记我的孩子们。无论你离得远还是离得近，请设法把他们培  养成有教养的人。如果有一次新的革命，所有的贵族都会被扼死，他们的父亲可能会因为杀死那个藏在屋顶上的农民而流亡他乡。请照顾这个家……伸出你的手。永别了，我的朋友！这是最后的时刻。做出这一重大牺牲之后，我希望我在众人面前有勇气想到我的名誉。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had been expecting despair. The simplicity of this farewell touched him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连本来等着种种绝望的表示。这番告别的简单打动了他。</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No,  I do not accept your farewell thus. I shall go; they wish it; you wish it  yourself. But, three days after my departure, I shall return to visit you by  night.'</p>

<div class="right">

<p>“不，我不能这样接受您的告别。我要走，他们要我走；您也要我走。可是，我走后三天，我会夜里回来看您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal's existence was changed. So Julien really did love her since he had  had the idea, of his own accord, of seeing her again. Her bitter grief changed  into one of the keenest bursts of joy that she had ever felt in her life.  Everything became easy to her. The certainty of seeing her lover again took  from these last moments all their lacerating force. From that instant the  conduct, like the features of Madame de Renal was noble, firm, and perfectly  conventional.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人的生活顿时改观。于连是真的很爱她了，因为是他自己想回来看她。她那可怕的痛苦变成了她有生以来所体验过的最强烈的  快乐。对她来说，一切都变得容易了。肯定能重见她的朋友，这使这最后的时刻不再是令人心碎的了。从这时起，德·莱纳夫人的举止和她的表情一样，高贵、坚定、十分得体。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Renal presently returned; he was beside himself. For the first time he  mentioned to his wife the anonymous letter which he had received two months  earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生很快就回来了，他气疯了。他终于向他妻子谈到两个月前收到的那封匿名信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  intend to take it to the Casino, to show them all that it comes from that  wretch Valenod, whom I picked up out of the gutter and made into one of the  richest citizens of Verrieres. I shall disgrace him publicly, and then fight  him. It is going too far.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我要把它带到‘夜总会’去，让大家都看看，这是卑鄙的瓦勒诺写的，是我把他从一个乞丐变成维里埃最富有的市民之一。我要公开地  让他出丑，然后跟他决斗。这太过分了。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  might be left a widow, great God!' thought Madame de Renal. But almost at the  same instant she said to herself: 'If I do not prevent this duel, as I  certainly can, I shall be my husband's murderess.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我可能成为寡妇，伟大的天主：“德·莱纳夫人想。然而几乎同时，她又自语：“我肯定能阻止这场决斗的，如果我不阻止，我将成为谋害我丈夫的凶手。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Never  before had she handled his vanity with so much skill. In less than two hours  she made him see, always by the use of arguments that had occurred first to  him, that he must show himself friendlier than ever towards M. Valenod, and  even take Elisa into the house again. Madame de Renal required courage to make  up her mind to set eyes on this girl, the cause of all her troubles. But the  idea had come to her from Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她从未如此巧妙地照顾他的虚荣心。不到两个钟头，她就让他看到，而且还是通过他自己找出的理由，他应该对瓦勒诺表示出比以往更多的友情，甚至把爱丽莎请回家。德·莱纳夫人决定再见这位给她带来种种不幸的姑娘，是需要些勇气的。不过，这主意是于连的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Finally,  after having been set three or four times in the right direction, M. de Renal  arrived of his own accord at the idea (highly distressing, from the financial  point of view) that the most unpleasant thing that could happen for himself was  that Julien, amid the seething excitement and gossip of the whole of Verrieres,  should remain there as tutor to M. Valenod's children. It was obviously in  Julien's interest to accept the offer made him by the Governor of the  Poorhouse. It was essential however to M. de Renal's fair fame that Julien  should leave Verrieres to enter the seminary at Besancon or at Dijon. But how  was he to be made to agree, and after that how was he to maintain himself  there?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过三、四次引导，德·莱纳先生终于怀着破财的痛苦认识到，他最难堪的是让于连在维里埃全城纷纷议论的时候去当瓦勒诺的孩子们的家庭教师。很明显，接受乞丐收容所所长的聘请对于连有利。相反，于连离开维里埃去贝藏松神学院或第戎神学院，对德莱纳先生的荣誉至关重要。可是如何能让他下定决心呢？此后他在那里如何生活呢？</p>

<p>M.  de Renal, seeing the imminence of a pecuniary sacrifice, was in greater despair  than his wife. For her part, after this conversation, she was in the position  of a man of feeling who, weary of life, has taken a dose of stramonium; he  ceases to act, save, so to speak, automatically, and no longer takes an  interest in anything. Thus Louis XIV on his deathbed was led to say: 'When I  was king.' An admirable speech!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生眼看看就要做出金钱的牺牲，比她妻子还要绝望。至于她，经过这次谈话，已经取得勇者的地位：倦于生活，服下一剂曼陀罗，顺其自然，万念俱灰。弥留之际的路易十四即如是说：“吾为王时。”妙哉此言！</p>

</div></div>

<p>On  the morrow, at break of day, M. de Renal received an anonymous letter. It was  couched in the most insulting style. The coarsest words applicable to his  position stared from every line. It was the work of some envious subordinate.  This letter brought him back to the thought of fighting a duel with M. Valenod.  Soon his courage had risen to the idea of an immediate execution of his design.  He left the house unaccompanied, and went to the gunsmith's to procure a brace  of pistols, which he told the man to load.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天一大早，德·莱纳先生接到一封匿名信。此信的文笔极具侮辱性。与他的处境相应的那种最粗俗的词语随处可见。这是某个下等的嫉妒者的作品。这封信又让他起了找瓦勒诺先生决斗的念头。很快，他勇气倍增，想马上就干。他独自出门，到武器店买了几把手枪，让人装上子弹。</p>

<p>'After  all,' he said to himself, 'should the drastic rule of the Emperor Napoleon be  restored, I myself could not be charged with the misappropriation of a  half-penny. At the most I have shut my eyes; but I have plenty of letters in my  desk authorising me to do so.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“总之”，他暗自说道，“即使拿破仑皇帝的严厉的行政管理制度回到世上，我也没有一个苏是诈骗来的，可以受到指责。我最多是曾经视而不见罢了，但是我抽屉里有不少信件允许我这样做。”</p>

<p>Madame  de Renal was frightened by her husband's cold anger, it brought back to her  mind the fatal thought of widowhood, which she found it so hard to banish. She  shut herself up with him. For hours on end she pleaded with him in vain, the  latest anonymous letter had determined him. At length she succeeded in  transforming the courage required to strike M. Valenod into that required to  offer Julien six hundred francs for his maintenance for one year in a Seminary.  M. de Renal, heaping a thousand curses on the day on which he had conceived the  fatal idea of taking a tutor into his household, forgot the anonymous letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人被她丈夫的这股憋着的怒火吓坏了，她又想起了那个她费了好大的劲儿才推开的当寡妇的不祥念头。她和他关在房里，她跟他谈了好几个钟头，没有用，新的匿名信已使他拿定主意。最后，她终于把一种勇气转化成另一种勇气，把给瓦勒诺先生一记耳光转化成供给于连在神学院一年膳宿费用六百法郎。德·莱纳先生千百次地诅咒那一天，那一天他竟心血来潮想弄个教师到家里来，便将匿名信置诸脑后了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  found a grain of comfort in an idea which he did not communicate to his wife:  by skilful handling, and by taking advantage of the young man's romantic ideas,  he hoped to bind him, for a smaller sum, to refuse M. Valenod's offers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他有了一个主意，心中稍觉快慰，但他未向妻子提起，他想利用年轻人好幻想的心理巧妙地让他保证拒绝瓦勒诺先生的提议而接受一笔数目小些的钱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal found it far harder to prove to Julien that, if he sacrificed to her  husband's convenience a post worth eight hundred francs, publicly offered him  by the Governor of the Poorhouse, he might without blushing accept some  compensation.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人的困难大得多，她得向于连证明，为了她丈夫的面子而牺牲了收容所所长公开提出的八百法郎的工作，他可以接受一点补偿而问心无愧。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But,'  Julien continued to object, 'I have never had, even for a moment, the slightest  thought of accepting that offer. You have made me too familiar with a life of  refinement, the vulgarity of those people would kill me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是，”于连总是说，“我从不曾哪怕是一时地有过接受这提议的打算。您已让我习惯于高雅的生活，那些人的粗俗我受不了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Cruel  necessity, with its hand of iron, bent Julien's will. His pride offered him the  self-deception of accepting only as a loan the sum offered by the Mayor of  Verrieres, and giving him a note of hand promising repayment with interest  after five years.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>残酷无情的贫困用它的铁手迫使于连的意志就范。他的骄傲使他产生一种幻想，只把维里埃市长提供的这笔钱作为借款接受，并出具一张  借据，五年内归还本息。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal had still some thousands of francs hidden in the little cave in the  mountains.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·菜纳夫人有几千法郎一直藏在小山洞里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  offered him these, trembling, and feeling only too sure that they would be  rejected with fury.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她战战兢兢地把这些钱送给他，深信会遭到他愤怒的拒绝。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  you wish,' Julien asked her, 'to make the memory of our love abominable?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您想让我们的爱情的回忆变得丑恶可憎吗？”于连对她说。</p>

</div></div>

<p>At  length Julien left Verrieres. M. de Renal was overjoyed; at the decisive moment  of accepting money from him, this sacrifice proved to be too great for Julien.  He refused point-blank. M. de Renal fell upon his neck, with tears in his eyes.  Julien having asked him for a testimonial to his character, he could not in his  enthusiasm find terms laudatory enough to extol the young man's conduct. Our  hero had saved up five louis and intended to ask Fouque for a similar amount.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连终于离开了维里埃。德·莱纳先生很高兴；在接受他的钱那个要命的时刻，于连觉得这牺牲不堪承受。他断然拒绝了。德·莱纳先生  热泪盈眶，一下子抱住了他。于连要求他开一张行为良好的证明，他欣喜若狂，一时竟找不到足够漂亮的词句来称赞于连的品行。我们的主人公有五个路易的积蓄，打算再向富凯要同样数目的一笔钱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was greatly moved. But when he had gone a league from Verrieres, where he was  leaving such a treasure of love behind him, he thought only of the pleasure of  seeing a capital, a great military centre like Besancon.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他很激动。然而，他刚走出他留下那么多爱情的维里埃法里，就只想着目睹贝藏松这样一座省府，一座军事重镇的幸福了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>During  this short parting of three days, Madame de Renal was duped by one of love's  most cruel illusions. Her life was tolerable enough, there was between her and  the last extremes of misery this final meeting that she was still to have with  Julien.She  counted the hours, the minutes that divided her from it. Finally, during the  night that followed the third day, she heard in the distance the signal  arranged between them. Having surmounted a thousand perils, Julien appeared  before her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在这短短三天的离别中，德·莱纳夫人为爱情的一种最残酷的失意所骗。她的日子还过得去，在她和极端的不幸之间还有最后再见一次于  连的希望。她一小时一小时、一分钟一分钟地计算着。终于，第三天夜里，她听见远处有约好的信号。于连经历了千难万险，出现在她面前。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>From  that moment, she had but a single thought: 'I am looking at you now for the  last time.' Far from responding to her lover's eagerness, she was like a barely  animated corpse. If she forced herself to tell him that she loved him, it was  with an awkward air that was almost a proof to the contrary. Nothing could take  her mind from the cruel thought of eternal separation. The suspicious Julien  fancied for a moment that she had already forgotten him. His hints at such a  possibility were received only with huge tears that flowed in silence, and with  a convulsive pressure of his hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>从这一刻起，她就只有一个念头，“这是我最后一次见他了。”她没有对情人的殷勤作出回应，倒像是一具还剩一回气的僵尸。她强迫自己说她爱他，可那笨拙的神情几乎证明了恰正相反。什么也不能使她摆脱永久分离的残酷念头。多疑的于连一时间以为自己已被遗忘。他因此说出一些带刺的话，他得到的只是静静流淌的大滴大滴泪珠和近乎痉挛的握手。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But,  Great God! How do you expect me to believe you?' was Julien's reply to his  mistress's chill protestations. 'You would show a hundred times more of sincere  affection to Madame Derville, to a mere acquaintance.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“可是，伟大的天主啊！您怎么能指望我相信您呢？”对他情人的冷冰冰的分辩，于连回答道，“您对德尔维夫人、对一个普通的熟人都会表现出百倍的真诚友情呀。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal, petrified, did not know how to answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人呆呆地，不知如何回答：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  would be impossible for a woman to be more wretched … I hope I am going to die  … I feel my heart freezing… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“没有人比我更不幸了……我想我要死了……我觉得我的心已冻住了……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Such  were the longest answers he was able to extract from her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这是他能得到的最长的回答。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  the approach of day made his departure necessary, Madame de Renal's tears  ceased all at once. She saw him fasten a knotted cord to the window without  saying a word, without returning his kisses. In vain might Julien say to her:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>天快亮了，不能不走了，德·莱纳夫人的眼泪完全止住了。她看见他把绳子系在窗户上，一声不吭，也没有吻他。于连徒然地对她说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'At  last we have reached the state for which you so longed. Henceforward you will  live without remorse. At the slightest indisposition of one of your children,  you will no longer see them already in the grave.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们终于到了您那么希望的地步。从今以后您可以毫无悔恨地生活了。您的孩子们稍微有点儿不舒服，您再不会以为只能在坟墓里见到  他们了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am sorry you could not say goodbye to Stanislas,' she said to him coldly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您不能拥抱斯坦尼斯拉，我很难过，”她冷冰冰地说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  the end, Julien was deeply impressed by the embraces, in which there was no  warmth, of this living corpse; he could think of nothing else for some leagues.  His spirit was crushed, and before crossing the pass, so long as he was able to  see the steeple of Verrieres church, he turned round often.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这具活僵尸的毫无热情的拥抱深深地震动了于连，他走了几里地还不能想别的事情，他的心已受伤，他在翻越高山之前，频频回首，直到  看不见维里埃的钟楼为止。
