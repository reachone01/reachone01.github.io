<p>The  prefect riding along on his horse thought to himself, Why should I not be a  minister, head of the Cabinet, a duke? This is how I would wage war… In that  way I would have innovators put in chains.</p>
<p>Le Globe</p></div>

<p>省长骑着马一边赶路，一边对自己说：“为什么我不可以当部长、内阁总理、公爵？我要这样去做战……用这个办法我要把那些革新者投进监狱。”</p>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>No  argument is sufficient to destroy the mastery acquired by ten years of pleasant  fancies. The Marquis thought it unreasonable to be angry, but could not bring  himself to forgive. 'If this Julien could die by accident,' he said to himself  at times… Thus it was that his sorrowful imagination found some relief in  pursuing the most absurd chimeras. They paralysed the influence of the wise  counsels of the abbe Pirard. A month passed in this way without the slightest  advance in the negotiations.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>任何理由也不能摧毁十年的美梦所建立起来的王国。侯爵并不认为生气是明智的，然而他又下不了决心饶恕。“这个于连要是能出个意外死掉就好了，”他有时候自言自语……就这样，他那伤心的想象从追逐最荒唐的幻影中得到些许安慰。这些幻影使彼拉神甫那些明智的道理起不了作用。一个月就这样过去了，谈判没有前进一步。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  this family affair, as in affairs of politics, the Marquis had brilliant  flashes of insight which would leave him enthusiastic for three days on end. At  such times a plan of conduct would not please him because it was backed by  sound reasons; the reasons found favour in his sight only in so far as they  supported his favourite plan. For three days, he would labour with all the  ardour and enthusiasm of a poet, to bring matters to a certain position; on the  fourth, he no longer gave it a thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在家庭事务和在政治事务中一样，侯爵常有些远见卓识，连着三天都很兴奋。这时，如果一个行动计划是建立在正确的推理之上的，他就不喜欢；他认为正中下怀的推理必须支持他的心爱的计划。三天之中，他怀着一个诗人的全部热情和兴奋进行工作，把事情推至某个阶段，过后就不管了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  first Julien was disconcerted by the dilatoriness of the Marquis; but,after  some weeks, he began to discern that M. de La Mole had, in dealing with this  affair, no definite plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连开始还对侯爵的迟缓感到困惑，可是过了几个礼拜，他开始猜到，德·拉莫尔先生在这件事情中还没有任何确定的计划。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de La Mole and the rest of the household thought that Julien had gone into the  country to look after the estates; he was in hiding in the abbe Pirard's  presbytery, and saw Mathilde almost every day; she,each morning, went to spend  an hour with her father, but sometimes they remained for weeks on end without  mentioning the matter that was occupying all their thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔夫人和府里的人都以为于连到外省去处理地产事务了。他躲在彼拉神甫的住宅里，几乎每天都见玛蒂尔德；而她则每天早晨去  父亲那儿呆一个钟头，有时候两个人几个礼拜都不谈那件萦绕在他们脑际的事情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  do not wish to know where that man is,' the Marquis said to her one day; 'send  him this letter.' Mathilde read:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不想知道这个人现在何处，”一天，侯爵对她说，“把这封信给他吧。”玛蒂尔德读道：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  estates in Languedoc bring in 20,600 francs. I give 10,600 francs to my  daughter, and 10,000 francs to M. Julien Sorel. I make over the estates  themselves, that is to say. Tell the lawyer to draft two separate deeds of  gift, and to bring me them tomorrow; after which, no further relations between  us. Ah! Sir, how was I to expect such a thing as this?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>朗格多克的土地，收入两万零六百法郎，一万零六百法郎给我女儿，一万法郎给于连先生。当然，土地也一起给你们。告诉公证人拟两个  赠与契约，明天就给我，此后我们就不再有关系了。唉！先生，这一切岂是我该料到的吗？</p>

<p>'I  thank you very much,' said Mathilde gaily. 'We are going to settle in the  Chateau d'Aiguillon, between Agen and Marmande. They say that the country there  is as beautiful as Italy.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“太谢谢您了，”玛蒂尔德高兴地说，“我们要在阿让和玛芒德之间的埃吉庸古堡定居。据说那地方跟意大利一样美。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="left">

<p>This  donation came as a great surprise to Julien. He was no longer the severe, cold  man that we have known. The destiny of his child absorbed all his thoughts in  anticipation. This unexpected fortune, quite considerable for so poor a man,  made him ambitious. He now saw, settled on his wife or himself, an income of  30,600 francs. As for Mathilde, all her sentiments were absorbed in one of  adoration of her husband, for thus it was that her pride always named Julien.  Her great, her sole ambition was to have her marriage recognised. She spent her  time in exaggerating the high degree of prudence that she had shown in uniting  her destiny with that of a superior man. Personal merit was in fashion in her  brain.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这份赠与便于连极为惊讶。他不再是我们曾经认识的那个严厉冷漠的人了。儿子还没出生，其命运已经吸引住他的全部心思。对一个如此  贫穷的人来说，这笔意外的财富还是相当可观的，他不禁生出一份野心。他眼看着他妻子或者说他有了一笔三万六千利弗尔的年金。至于玛蒂尔德，她的全部感情都融进了对丈夫的崇拜之中，出于自尊，她一直把于连称作丈夫。她的巨大的、唯一的野心就是让她的婚姻得到承认。她时时都在夸大她表现出的高度明智，把自己的命运和一个出类拔萃的男人的命运结合在一起。在她的头脑里，个人的才干是很时髦的东西。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Their  almost continuous separation, the multiplicity of business, the little time  that they had to talk of love, now completed the good effect of the wise policy  adopted by Julien in the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>几乎是持续不断的分离，事情的错综复杂，谈情说爱的时间的稀少，都使于连从前制订的明智策略所产生的好效果变得越来越全面了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Finally  Mathilde grew impatient at seeing so little of the man whom she had now come to  love sincerely.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德现在真地爱上了这个人，却又很少见到他，她终于不耐烦了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  a moment of ill humour she wrote to her father, and began her letter like  Othello:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她在情绪不好的情况下，写了封信给她父亲，开头简直像《奥塞罗》：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  I have preferred Julien to the attractions which society offered to the  daughter of M. le Marquis de La Mole, my choice of him sufficiently proves.  These pleasures of reputation and petty vanity are nothing to me. It will soon  be six weeks that I have lived apart from my husband.That  is enough to prove my respect for you. Before next Thursday, I shall leave the  paternal roof. Your generosity has made us rich. No one knows my secret save  the estimable abbe Pirard. I shall go to him; he will marry us, and an hour  after the ceremony we shall be on our way to Langue doc, and shall never appear  again in Paris save by your order. But what pierces me to the heart is that all  this will furnish a savoury anecdote at my expense, and at yours. May not the  epigrams of a foolish public oblige our excellent Norbert to seek a quarrel  with Julien? In that event, I know him, I should have no control over him. We  should find in his heart the plebeian in revolt. I implore you on my knees, O  my father,come and attend our wedding, in M. Pirard's church, next Thursday.  The point of the malicious anecdote will be blunted, and the life of your only  son, my husband's life will be made safe,' etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>与社会向德·拉莫尔侯爵先生的女儿提供的种种乐趣相比，我更喜欢于连，我的选择足以证明这一点。那些因受人敬重和满足小小的虚荣  而得到的快乐，对我来说，形同乌有。我和我的丈夫分离眼看就六个礼拜了。这足以证明我对您的尊重。下礼拜四之前，我将离开父亲的家。您的恩德已使我们富有。除了可敬的彼拉神甫，没有人知道我的秘密。我要去他那儿，他将为我们主持婚礼，仪式结束一个钟头之后，我们就去朗格多克，除非有您的命令，我们将永不在巴黎露面。然而使我伤心的是，这一切将被编成耸人听闻的传闻，用来攻击我，攻击您。一个愚蠢的公众所编造的那些俏皮话难道不会迫使我们善良的诺贝尔去找于连的麻烦吗？我了解他，在这种情况下，我对他是无能为力的。我们会在他的灵魂中发现一个反抗的平民。我跪下请求您，我的父亲啊！来参加我的婚礼吧，在彼拉神甫的教堂里，下礼拜四，那些恶毒的传闻将失去锋芒，您的独子的生命、我丈夫的生命将得到保障……</p>

<p>This  letter plunged the Marquis in a strange embarrassment. He must now at length  make up his mind. AH his little habits, all his common place friends had lost  their influence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这封信把侯爵的人投进一种奇特的窘困之中。这么说，必须拿出个主意来罗。所有细小的习惯，所有平常的朋友，都已失去了影啊。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  these strange circumstances, the salient features of his character,stamped upon  it by the events of his younger days, resumed their full sway. The troubles of  the Emigration had made him a man of imagination. After he had enjoyed for two  years an immense fortune and all the distinctions of the Court, 1790 had cast  him into the fearful hardships of the Emigration. This hard school had changed  the heart of a man of two and twenty. Actually he was encamped amid his present  wealth rather than dominated by it. But this same imagination which had  preserved his soul from the gangrene of gold, had left him a prey to an insane  passion for seeing his daughter adorned with a fine sounding title.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在这种非同寻常的情况下，他性格中那些受到年轻时种种事件影响的重大特征，又恢复了它们的全部力量。流亡的苦难使他成了一个富于  想象力的人。他在两年中享有巨大的财富和宫廷的宠幸，然而一七九Ｏ年的革命把他投入到流亡的可怕灾难之中。这所严酷的学校改变了一颗二十二岁的灵魂。实际上，他是坐镇眼下的财富之中，而不大为其所制。然而，同一种想象力使他的灵魂免受金钱的腐蚀，却使他饱受一种疯狂的激情的折磨，即看到他的女儿有一个漂亮的封号。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>During  the six weeks that had just elapsed, urged at one moment by a caprice, the  Marquis had decided to enrich Julien; poverty seemed to him ignoble,  dishonouring to himself, M. de La Mole, impossible in the husband of his  daughter; he showered money upon him. Next day, his imagination taking another  direction, it seemed to him that Julien would hear the silent voice of this  generosity in the matter of money, change his name, retire to America, write to  Mathilde that he was dead to her. M. De La Mole imagined this letter as  written, and traced its effect on his daughter's character…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在刚刚过去的六个礼拜中，侯爵有时心血来潮，想让于连变得富有；他觉得贫穷是可耻的，对他德·拉莫尔先生来说更是不体面的，而在他女儿的丈夫身上则是不可能的；他得拿出钱来。第二天，他的想象又变了方向，他觉得于连会明白这种金钱上的慷慨未曾明言的意思，会改名换姓，远走美洲，给玛蒂尔德写信说他已为她死去。德·拉莫尔先生假定信已写好，揣摩着它对女儿性格的影响……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the day on which he was awakened from these youthful dreams by Mathilde's real  letter, after having long thought of killing Julien or of making him disappear,  he was dreaming of building up for him a brilliant future. He was making him  take the name of one of his properties;and why should he not secure the  transmission of his peerage to him? M.le Duc de Chaulnes, his father-in-law,  had spoken to him several times,since his only son had been killed in Spain, of  wishing to hand on his title to Norbert …</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德的真实的信把他从这些如此幼稚的梦幻中拉了出来，那一天他想了好久如何杀死于连或让他失踪，然后又想如何让他有个辉煌前程。他让于连用他的一处庄园的名称作姓氏；为什么不能把自己的爵位传给他呢？他的岳父德·肖纳公爵，自从他的独子战死西班牙之后，已经跟他说过好几次，想把他的爵位传给诺贝尔……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  cannot deny that Julien shows a singular aptitude for business,audacity,  perhaps even brilliance,' the Marquis said to himself… 'But at the back of that  character, I find something alarming. It is the impression that he produces on  everyone, therefore there must be something real in it' (the more difficult  this reality was to grasp, the more it alarmed the imaginative spirit of the  old Marquis).</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不能不承认于连有不寻常的办事能力，有胆量，甚至可能还有些才华。”侯爵暗想……“但是在他性格的深处，我发现有某种可怕的东西。这是他留给所有人的印象，因此一定有什么真实存在的东西（这种真实的东西越是难以抓住，就越是让老侯爵那富于想象力的心灵感到害怕。）</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  daughter expressed it to me very cleverly the other day' (in a letter which we  have suppressed): '&quot;Julien belongs to no drawing-room, to no set.&quot; He  has not contrived to find any support against me, not the slightest resource if  I abandon him… But is that due to ignorance of the actual state of society? Two  or three times I have said to him: &quot;There is no real and profitable  candidature save that of the drawing-rooms … &quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的女儿有一天极巧妙地说了出来（在一封没有引用的信里）：‘于连不属于任何客厅，不属于任何小集团。’他没有寻求任何支持来反对我，我要是抛弃他，他一点儿办法也没有……可这是对社会当前状况的无知吗？……有两、三次我对他说：‘要当候选人，只有客厅的支持才是切实的、有用的支持……’</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No,  he has not the adroit and cautious spirit of a pettifogger who never loses a  minute or an opportunity… It is not at all the character of a Louis XI. On the  other hand, I see in him the most ungenerous maxims … I lose track of him… Does  he repeat those maxims to himself, to serve as a dam to his passions?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不，他没有一个不失去一分钟、一个机会的律师所具有的那种机灵、狡猾的才能……这不是一种路易十一式的性格。另一方面，我看见他满口最不宽容的格言警句……我真糊涂了……他是用这些格言警句来构筑阻挡激情的堤坝吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Anyhow,  one thing is clear: he cannot endure contempt, in that way I hold him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“至少有一点很清楚：他受不了蔑视，我从这里下手掌握他。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  has not the religious feeling for high birth, it is true, he does not respect  us by instinct … That is bad; but, after all, the heart of a seminarist should  be impatient only of the want of pleasure and money. He is very different; he  cannot endure contempt at any price.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“的确，他对高贵的出身并不崇拜，他并非本能地尊重我们……这是个缺点，不过，一个神学院学生的灵魂忍受不了的应该是享乐和金钱  的匮乏。而他却不同，他无论如何不能忍受蔑视。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Forced  by his daughter's letter, M. de La Mole saw the necessity of making up his  mind: 'Well, here is the great question: has Julien's audacity gone the length  of setting him to make love to my daughter, because he knows that I love her  more than anything in the world, and that I have an income of a hundred  thousand crowns?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在女儿来信的催逼下，德·拉莫尔先生觉得必须下决心了。“总之，关键的问题在于：于连胆子大到追求我女儿的程度，是不是因为他知道我最爱她，我有十万埃居的进款呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Mathilde  protests the opposite… No, master Julien, that is a point upon which I wish to  be under no illusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“玛蒂尔德反对这种看法……不，于连先生，在这一点上我可不愿意存在幻想。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Has  there been genuine, unpremeditated love? Or rather a vulgar desire to raise  himself to a good position? Mathilde is perspicacious, she felt from the first  that this suspicion might ruin him with me; hence that admission: it was she  who thought first of loving him…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“果然有真正的、出乎意料的爱情吗？或者只是向上爬的庸俗欲望呢？玛蒂尔德看得很清楚，她首先感觉到这种怀疑会在我的心目中毁掉  他，所以她才承认是她先爱上他的……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  a girl of so lofty a character should so far have forgotten herself as to make  tangible advances! … Press his arm in the garden, one evening, how horrible! As  though she had not had a hundred less indelicate ways of letting him know that  she favoured him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一个性格如此高傲的女孩子，竟会忘平所以，主动做出那样具体的举动！……一天晚上，在花园里拉住他的胳膊，多么可怕！好像她没有千百种稍微体面些的办法让他知道她看中了他似的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  excuse is to accuse; I distrust Mathilde… ' That day, the Marquis's arguments  were more conclusive than usual. Habit, however, prevailed;he resolved to gain  time and to write to his daughter; for they communicated by letter between  different parts of the house. M. de La Mole dared not discuss matters with  Mathilde and hold out against her. He was afraid of bringing everything to an  end by a sudden concession.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“辩解等于承认；我不相信玛蒂尔德……”这一天，侯爵的分析比平时更具结论性。不过，还是习惯占了上风，他决定争取时间，就给女儿写了一封信。因为在这座府邸里人们是互相写信的。德·拉莫尔先生不敢和玛蒂尔德面对面地谈，不敢顶她。他怕突然一个让步，整个事情便告结束。</p>

<p>'M.  de La Vernaye would be at your feet, speechless with gratitude, if he knew all  that you are deigning to do for him. But, in the midst of this generosity, my  father has forgotten me; your daughter's honour is in danger. A single  indiscretion may leave an everlasting blot, which an income of twenty thousand  crowns would not efface. I shall send this commission to M. de La Vernaye only  if you give me your word that, in the course of the next month, my marriage  shall be celebrated in public, at Villequier. Soon after that period, which I  beg you not to prolong, your daughter will be unable to appear in public save  with the name of Ma dame de La Vernaye. How I thank you, dear Papa, for having  saved me from the name of Sorel,' etc., etc.</p>

<p>如果德·拉韦尔奈先生知道您肯屈尊为他做的这一切，定会感激涕零，诚惶诚恐，匍伏在您的脚下。然而，我的父亲如此宽洪大量，却独  独把我忘了；您的女儿的名誉处在危险之中。稍有不慎便会留下永久的污点，两万埃居的年金也不能弥补。如果您对我许下诺言，下个月我的婚札在维尔基埃公开举行，我就把委任状送给德·拉韦尔奈先生。我求您不要超过这个期限，因为过了这个期限不久，您的女儿就只能以德·拉韦尔奈夫人的名义在公开场合露面了。我多么感谢您，亲爱的爸爸，您把我从索莱尔这个姓氏中解救了出来，……</p>

<p>回信出乎意料。</p>

<div class="layout">

<div class="right">

<p>The  firmness of this reply astonished Mathilde. 'I do not know Julien';these words  plunged her in a daydream which presently ended in the most enchanting  suppositions; but she believed them to be the truth. 'My Julien's mind has not  donned the tawdry little uniform of the drawing rooms, and my father  disbelieves in his superiority because of the very fact which proves it …</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这封回信如此坚决，玛蒂尔德不免吃了一惊。我不了解于连，这句话让她浮想联翩，很快就得出一些最具魅力的假设、而她认为这些假设是真实的。“我的于连的才智没有穿上客厅的那套庸俗的小制服，这证明了他出类拔萃，我父亲不相信，恰恰是因为这一点……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Anyhow,  if I do not obey this sudden impulse, I foresee the possibility of a public  scene; a scandal lowers my position in society, and may make me less attractive  in Julien's eyes. After the scandal… ten years of poverty; and the folly of  choosing a husband on account of his merit can only be saved from ridicule by  the most brilliant opulence. If I live apart from my father, at his age, he may  forget me … Norbert will marry some attractive, clever woman: the old Louis XIV  was beguiled by the Duchesse de Bourgogne … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“然而，他这个心血来潮的想法刚刚露头，我若不服从，就可能导致一场公开的争吵；张扬出去会降低我的社会地位，可能让我在于连的眼中也不那么可爱了。张扬出去之后……就是十年的贫穷；单凭才能挑选丈夫这种傻事，只有靠了家财巨万才能免遭世人耻笑。如果远离父亲生活，他那么大年纪，是可能忘了我的……诺贝尔会娶一个可爱的、机灵的妻子，年迈的路易十四还受到德·勃民第公爵夫人的引诱呢……”</p>
