<p>I  now mean to be serious:—it is time, Since laughter nowadays is deem'd too  serious. A jest at Vice by Virtue's call'd a crime.</p>
<p>Don Juan, XIII.</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>我现在想严肃起来，是时候了，因为目前笑被人认为太严肃了，‘美德’对‘罪恶’开的玩笑称为罪过。</p>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>She  did not appear at dinner. In the evening she came to the drawing room for a  moment, but did not look at Julien. This behaviour seemed to him strange;  'but,' he thought, 'I do not know the ways of good society, she will give me some  good reason for all this.' At the same time, urged by the most intense  curiosity, he studied the expression on Mathilde's features; he could not  conceal from himself that she had a sharp and malevolent air. Evidently this  was not the same woman who, the night before, had felt or pretended to feel  transports of joy too excessive to be genuine.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她没有来吃晚饭。晚上，她到客厅来了一会儿，没有看于连。他觉得这种态度很奇怪；“不过”，他想，“我不了解他们的习惯，以后她会把这一切给我解释清楚的。”但是，最强烈的好奇弄得他坐立不安，他开始研究起玛蒂尔德脸上的表情；他不能不承认，她的神情是冷酷的，恶狠狠的。显然，这不是同一个女人了，昨天夜里她洋溢或假装洋溢着幸福的热狂，只是那热狂太过分，不可能是真的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next  day, and the day after, the same coldness on her part; she never once looked at  him, she seemed unaware of his existence. Julien, devoured by the keenest anxiety,  was a thousand leagues from the feeling of triumph which alone had animated him  on the first day. 'Can it, by any chance,' he asked himself, 'be a return to  the path of virtue?' But that was a very middleclass expression to use of the  proud Mathilde.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
　　
<p>第二天，第三天，她是同样地冷淡；她不看他，甚至对他的存在浑然不觉。于连受着最强烈的不安煎熬，第一天他还只觉得受到胜利感的鼓舞，现在却相距千里之遥了。他对自己说：“是不是突然间又回到道德上去了？”不过，对高傲的玛蒂尔德而言，这样说未免太庸俗了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  the ordinary situations of life she has no belief in religion,' thought Julien;  'she values it as being very useful to the interests of her caste.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在日常生活里，她不大相信宗教，”于连想，“她喜欢宗教是因为它对维护她那个等级的利益很有用。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  out of simple delicacy may she not be bitterly reproaching herself with the  mistake that she has made?' Julien assumed that he was her first lover.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“但是，她能不能仅仅由于脆弱就强烈谴责她所犯的错以呢？”于连相信自己是她的第一个情夫。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But,'  he said to himself at other moments, 'one must admit that there is nothing  artless, simple, tender, in her attitude; never have I seen her looking so  haughty. Can she despise me? It would be like her to reproach herself with what  she has done for me, solely on account of my humble birth.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“但是，”他有时候又想，“应该承认，在她的整个态度中没有丝毫的天真、单纯和温柔；我从未见她这样高傲过。她会是蔑视我吗？仅仅因为我出身低微，她就责备自己对我干下的事，这也是她做得出的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While  Julien, steeped in the prejudices he had derived from books and from memories  of Verrieres, was pursuing the chimera of a tender mistress who never gives a thought  to her own existence the moment she has gratified the desires of her lover,  Mathilde in her vanity was furious with him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连满脑子从书本和对维里埃生活的回忆里得来的偏见，幻想着一个温柔的情妇，她从使情夫得到幸福的那一刻起就不再考虑自己的存在，而这个时候，玛蒂尔德的虚荣却冲着他爆发了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  she had ceased to be bored for the last two months, she was no longer afraid of  boredom; so, albeit he could not for a moment suspect it, Julien was deprived  of his strongest advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>由于她两个月来已不再感到厌倦，所以她也不害怕厌倦了；这样，于连一点儿都还没想到，就已经失去了他最大的优势。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have given myself a master!' Mademoiselle de La Mole was saying to herself, in  the grip of the blackest despond. 'He may be the soul of honour; but if I goad  his vanity to extremes, he will have his revenge by making public the nature of  our relations.' Mathilde had never had a lover, and at this epoch in life,  which gives certain tender illusions to even the most sterile hearts, she was a  prey to the bitterest reflections.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我给我自己找了个主人！”德·拉莫尔小姐心想，她已陷入极度的悲伤之中。“他很看重名誉，这好极了；但是如果我把他的虚荣心逼进绝境，他就会报复，把我们的关系的性质公诸与众。”玛蒂尔德从不曾有过情夫，在这种甚至最冷漠的心灵也会滋生某种温柔梦幻的生活境况里，她陷入最苦涩的沉思。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  has an immense power over me, since he reigns by terror and can inflict a  fearful punishment on me if I drive him to extremes.' This idea, by itself, was  enough to provoke Mathilde to insult him. Courage was the fundamental quality  in her character. Nothing was capable of giving her any excitement and of  curing her of an ever-present tendency to boredom, but the idea that she was  playing heads or tails with her whole existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他对我拥有巨大的权力，因为他通过恐怖来控制，如果我把他逼入绝境，他能对我进行残忍的惩罚。”单单这样想就足以驱使德·拉莫尔小姐去侮辱他。勇敢乃是她的性格的首要品质。她在拿她的整个生命进行赌博，除了这个念头，没有什么能刺激刺激她，医好她那不断再生的根深蒂固的厌倦。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the third day, as Mademoiselle de La Mole persisted in not looking at him,  Julien followed her after dinner, to her evident annoyance, into the billiard  room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第三天，德·拉莫尔小姐还是执意不看他，晚饭后，于连不顾她明显的不悦，跟着她进了弹子房。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well,  Sir; you must imagine yourself to have acquired some very powerful hold over  me,' she said to him, with ill-controlled rage, 'since in opposition to my  clearly expressed wishes, you insist on speaking to me?Are  you aware that nobody in the world has ever been so presumptuous?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好吧，先生，既然您不顾我明确表示出的意愿，一定要跟我说话，”她对他说，勉强压住怒火，“您是不是以为已经取得了支配我的强大权利？……您知道吗，世界上还从未有人有这么大的胆子？”</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Nothing  could be more entertaining than the dialogue between these two lovers;  unconsciously they were animated by a mutual sentiment of the keenest hatred.  As neither of them had a consistent nature, as moreover they were used to the  ways of good society, it was not long before they both declared in plain terms  that they had quarrelled for ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这一对情人的谈话再滑稽不过了，他们不觉间激动起来，彼此都怀着最强烈的仇恨感情。由于双方都没有耐性，又都有着上流社会的习惯，所以他们很快便明确宣布永远断绝来往。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  swear to you eternal secrecy,' said Julien; 'I would even add that I will never  address a word to you again, were it not that your reputation might be injured  by too marked a change.' He bowed respectfully and left her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我向您发誓永远严守秘密，”于连说，“我甚至还可以发誓永远不同您说话，只要您的名声不因这种过于明显的变化而受到损害。”他恭恭敬敬地行了礼，走了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  performed without undue difficulty what he regarded as a duty; he was far from  imagining himself to be deeply in love with Mademoiselle de La Mole. No doubt  he had not been in love with her three days earlier, when he had been concealed  in the great mahogany wardrobe.But  everything changed rapidly in his heart from the moment when he saw himself  parted from her forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他认为这是一种责任，轻而易举地完成了；然而，他万万没有想到，他已经深深地爱上了德·拉莫尔小姐。当然，三天前他被藏在大衣橱里时，他并不爱她。但是，从他看见他们永远断绝来往的那一刻起，他心灵中的一切都迅速地变了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  pitiless memory set to work reminding him of the slightest incidents of that  night which in reality had left him so cold.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的记忆力是残酷的，开始纤毫毕露地为他重现那天夜里的情景，实际上，那一夜让他的心冷了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>During  the very night after their vow of eternal separation, Julien nearly went mad  when he found himself forced to admit that he was in love with Mademoiselle de  La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在宣布永远断绝来往的第二天夜里，于连差点发疯，他不得不承认他爱德·拉莫尔小姐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  ghastly conflict followed this discovery: all his feelings were thrown into  confusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>跟着这一发现而来的是可怕的斗争：他的种种情感全都被搅乱了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Two  days later, instead of being haughty with M. de Croisenois, he could almost  have burst into tears and embraced him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>两天以后，他非但不能傲视德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生，反而几乎想抱住他痛哭一场。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  force of continued unhappiness gave him a glimmer of common sense; he decided  to set off for Languedoc, packed his trunk and went to the posting house.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他对不幸也习惯了，很快有了点儿理智，就决定去朗格多克，打好箱子去了驿站。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  almost fainted when, on reaching the coach office, he was informed that, by  mere chance, there was a place vacant next day in the Toulouse mail. He engaged  it and returned to the Hotel de La Mole to warn the Marquis of his departure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他到了驿车售票处，人家告诉他碰巧第二天去图鲁兹的驿车上有个位置，他差点儿昏了过去。他订下这个座位，回到德·拉莫尔府，准备向侯爵禀报。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de La Mole had gone out. More dead than alive, Julien went to wait for him in the  library. What were his feelings on finding Mademoiselle de La Mole there?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔先生出门了。半死不活的于连去图书室等他。哎呀，德·拉莫尔小姐在那儿，这可怎么办？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  seeing him appear, she assumed an air of malevolence which it was impossible  for him to misinterpret, Carried away by his misery, dazed by surprise, Julien  was weak enough to say to her, in the tenderest of tones and one that sprang  from the heart: 'Then, you no longer love me?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>看见他来了，她拿出了一付恶狠狠的神情，他不可能看错。于连太不幸了，又被这意外的相遇弄昏了头，心一软，竟用最温柔的、发自内心的口吻对她说：“这么说，您不爱我了？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am horrified at having given myself to the first comer,' said Mathilde, weeping  with rage at herself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我厌恶我委身于随便什么人，”玛蒂尔德哭着说，她恨她自己。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  the first comer!' cried Julien, and he snatched up an old mediaeval sword which  was kept in the library as a curiosity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“随便什么人！”于连叫起来，他朝一把中世纪的古剑扑过去，那把古剑是作为古董收藏在图书室里的。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  grief, which he had believed to be intense at the moment of his speaking to  Mademoiselle de La Mole, had now been increased an hundredfold by the tears of  shame which he saw her shed. He would have been the happiest of men had it been  possible to kill her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他相信在向德·拉莫尔小姐说话时自己已痛苦到极点，待他看见她流出羞愧的眼泪时，他的痛苦又增加了一百倍。如果能杀死她，他就是世界上最幸福的人了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Just  as he had drawn the sword, with some difficulty, from its antiquated scabbard,  Mathilde, delighted by so novel a sensation, advanced proudly towards him; her  tears had ceased to flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他费了些力气，从古旧的鞘里拔出剑来，就在这时，玛蒂尔德感到了幸福，一种如此新奇的感觉油然而生，她高傲地朝他走去，眼泪也不流了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  thought of the Marquis de La Mole, his benefactor, arose vividly in Julien's  mind. 'I should be killing his daughter!' he said to himself; 'how horrible!'  He made as though to fling away the sword. 'Certainly,' he thought, 'she will  now burst out laughing at the sight of this melodramatic gesture': thanks to  this consideration, he entirely regained his self-possession. He examined the  blade of the old sword with curiosity, and as though he were looking for a spot  of rust, then replaced it in its scabbard, and with the utmost calm hung it up  on the nail of gilded bronze from which he had taken it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连突然想到了他的恩人德·拉莫尔侯爵，宛然如在眼前。“我要杀死他的女儿！”他心里说，“多可怕啊！”他动了动，想把剑扔掉。“肯定”，他想，“她看到这个演戏的动作会放声大笑的。”想到这儿，他完全恢复了冷静。他好奇地注视着古剑的锋口，好像看看有没有锈斑，然后插入鞘中，极其沉着地挂回到那颗镀金的青铜钉子上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  series of actions, very deliberate towards the end, occupied fully a minute;  Mademoiselle de La Mole gazed at him in astonishment. 'So I have been within an  inch of being killed by my lover!' she said to herself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>整个动作自始至终非常缓慢，足有一分钟。德·拉莫尔小姐惊奇地望着他。“这么说，我差点儿被我的情人杀死！”她对自己说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  thought carried her back to the bravest days of the age of Charles IX and Henri  III.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个想法把她带回到查理九世和亨利三世那个时代最美好的岁月中了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  stood motionless before Julien who had now replaced the sword, she gazed at him  with eyes in which there was no more hatred. It must be admitted that she was  very attractive at that moment, certainly no woman had ever borne less  resemblance to a Parisian doll (this label expressed Julien's chief objection  to the women of that city).</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她站在刚把剑挂回去的于连面前，一动不动，凝视着他，眼睛里不再有仇恨了。应该承认，此刻的她是很迷人的，肯定从未有女人比她更不像一个巴黎玩偶（这个词是于连对这个城市的女人最严重的批评）。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am going to fall back into a fondness for him,' thought Mathilde; 'and then at  once he would suppose himself to be my lord and master, after a relapse, and at  the very moment when I have just spoken to him so firmly.' She fled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我又要对他有所偏爱了，”玛蒂尔德想，“如果我跟他如此强硬地说话之后再次失足，他肯定会认为他是我的主人了。”她跑了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  God! How beautiful she is!' said Julien, as he watched her run from the room:  'that is the creature who flung herself into my arms with such frenzy not a  week ago … And those moments will never come again! And it is my fault! And, at  the moment of so extraordinary an action, and one that concerned me so closely,  I was not conscious of it!… I must admit that I was born with a very dull and  unhappy nature.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的天主！她多美啊！”于连看着她跑了，说，“就是这个女人不到一个礼拜之前曾经那么狂热地投入我的怀抱……这样的时刻一去不复返了！而且还是由于我的过错！在她采取一个如此不寻常、对我如此重要的行动的时刻，我竟无所感觉！……应该承认，我生来就有一个很平庸很倒霉的性格。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis appeared; Julien made haste to inform him of his departure.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵来了，于连忙向他辞行。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'For  where?' said M. de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“去哪儿？”德·拉莫尔先生问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'For  Languedoc.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“去朗格多克。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No,  if you please, you are reserved for a higher destiny; if you go any where, it  will be to the North… Indeed, in military parlance, I confine you to your  quarters. You will oblige me by never being absent for more than two or three  hours, I may need you at any moment.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“对不起，不行，您留下有更重大的使命，如果要走，也是去北方……甚至，用一句军事术语，我命令您在府中待命。您外出不得超过两个或三个钟头，我可能随时需要您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  bowed, and withdrew without uttering a word, leaving the Marquis greatly  astonished; he was incapable of speech, and shut himself up in his room. There,  he was free to exaggerate all the iniquity of his lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连行了个礼，一言不发地退下，侯爵颇感惊讶。他一句话也说不出来，回到房中把自己关起来。在那里，他可以随意夸大命运的残酷。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  so,' he thought, 'I cannot even go away! God knows for how many days the  Marquis is going to keep me in Paris; great God! What is to become of me? And  not a friend that I can consult; the abbe Pirard would not let me finish my  first sentence, Conte Altamira would offer to enlist me in some conspiracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这么说，”他想，“我走开都不行！天知道侯爵把我留在巴黎多少天；伟大的天主！结果我会怎样呢？没有一个朋友可以商量，彼拉神甫连头一句话都不会让我说完，阿尔塔米拉伯爵会建议我参与什么阴谋。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  meanwhile I am mad, I feel it; I am mad!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“然而我疯了，我感觉到了；我疯了！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Who  can guide me, what is to become of me?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“谁能引导我？我会变成什么样子？”
