<div class="layout">
<div class="right">维里埃算得弗朗什－孔泰最漂亮的小城之一。一幢幢房子，白墙，红瓦，尖顶，展布在一座小山的斜坡上。茁壮的栗树密密匝匝，画出了小山最细微的凹凸。城墙下数百步外，有杜河流过。这城墙早年为西班牙人所建，如今已残破不堪。</div>
  <div class="left">The small town of  Verrieres may be regarded as one of the most attractive in the Franche-Comte.  Its white houses with their high pitched roofs of red tiles are spread over the  slope of a hill, the slightest contours of which are indicated by clumps of  sturdy chestnuts. The Doubs runs some hundreds of feet below its  fortifications, built in times past by the Spaniards, and now in ruins. </div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">维里埃北面有高山荫护，那是汝拉山脉的一支。十月乍寒，破碎的威拉峰顶便已盖满了雪，从山上下来的一股激流，穿过小城注入杜河，使大量的木锯转动起来。这是一种很简单的工业，小城的居民更象是乡下人，多数人家的日子于是有了几分舒适。不过，使小城富起来的并非木锯。普遍的富裕靠的是生产一种印花布，世称米鲁兹花布，所以，拿破仑倒台以后，维里埃几乎家家户户都把房屋的门面重新修过。</div>
<div class="left">Verrieres is sheltered on the north by a high mountain, a spur of the Jura. The jagged peaks of the Verra put on a mantle of snow in the first cold days of October. A torrent which comes tearing down from the mountain passes through Verrieres before emptying its waters into the Doubs, and supplies power to a great number of sawmills; this is an extremely simple industry, and procures a certain degree of comfort  for the
majority of the inhabitants, who are of the peasant rather than of the burgess class. It is not, however, the sawmills that have made this little town rich. It is to the manufacture of printed calicoes, known as Mulhouse stuffs, that it owes the general prosperity which, since the fall of Napoleon, has led to the refacing of almost all the houses in Verrieres.</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">一进城，就会听见一台声音嘈杂、样子吓人的机器轰隆隆作响，搅得人头昏脑胀。二十个沉重的铁锤，全靠一只由湍急的水流带动的轮子，升起，落下，震得路面直打颤。我也说不清一个铁锤一天要生产几千枚钉子。起落之间一些水灵俏丽的姑娘把小铁块送到巨大的铁锤下面铁块旋即变成了钉子。这劳动看起来如此粗笨，却使初次进入法国和瑞士之间这片山区的旅人啧啧称奇，倘若踏入维里埃的旅人问起大街上耳朵都被震聋了的行人，那座漂亮的制钉厂是谁的，有人就会打着一种拖长的腔调说：“咳，市长先生的呗！”</div>

 <div class="left">No sooner has one entered the town than one is startled by the din of a noisy machine of terrifying aspect. A score of weighty hammers, falling with a clang which makes the pavement tremble, are raised aloft by a wheel which the water of the torrent sets in motion. Each of these hammers turns out, daily, I cannot say how many thousands of nails. A bevy of fresh, pretty girls subject  to the blows of these enormous hammers, the little scraps of iron which are rapidly transformed into nails. This work,so rough to the outward eye, is one of the industries that most astonish the traveller who ventures for the first time among the mountains that divide France from Switzerland. If, on entering Verrieres, the traveller inquires to whom belongs that fine nail factory which deafens everybody who passes up the main street, he will be told in a drawling accent: 'Eh!It belongs to the Mayor.'</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
 <div class="right">维里埃有一条大街，从杜河岸边一直爬到山顶。旅人只要稍作停留，十有八九会遇见一个身材高大的人，神色匆匆，一副很了不起的样子。</div>

<div class="left">Provided the traveller halts for a few moments in this main street of Verrieres, which runs from the bank of the Doubs nearly to the summit of the hill, it is a hundred to one that he will see a tall man appear, with a busy, important air.
</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
 <div class="right">行人一看见他，就赶紧脱帽致意。这位好几等骑士勋章的获得者穿着一身灰色的衣服，头发已经花白，大脑门，鹰勾鼻，五官大致算得端正：初见，人们甚至还会觉得这张脸兼有小城市长的威严和尚存于四十八岁至五十岁男人身上的那种吸引力。然而，巴黎来的旅人转眼间便会感到不快，他那种志得意满的神气中还混杂有一种说不上来的狭隘和创造力的匮乏。这位旅人终于意识到，此人的才干仅止于让欠帐的人如期偿还，而若是他欠了账，则要拖得不能再拖。</div>

<div class="left">
At the sight of him every hat is quickly raised. His hair is turning grey,and he is dressed in grey. He is a Companion of several Orders, has a high forehead, an aquiline  nose, and on the whole his face is not wanting in a certain regularity: indeed, the first impression formed of it may be that it combines with the dignity of a village mayor that sort of charm which may still be found in a man of forty-eight or fifty. But soon the visitor from Paris is annoyed by a certain air of self-satisfaction and self-sufficiency mingled with a suggestion of limitations and want of originality.One feels, finally, that this man's talent is confined to securing the exact payment of whatever is owed to him and to postponing payment till the last possible moment when he is the debtor.</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">这便是维里埃的市长德.莱纳先生。他步履庄重，穿过大街，进入市政厅，在旅人的眼前消失。这位旅人若继续闲逛，再往上走一百步，他会瞥见一幢外观相当漂亮的房子，越过与之相连的一道铁栅栏，还有一片极美的花园。远处是勃艮第的丘陵形成的一线天际，曲折有致，尽如人意，仿佛就是为了让人看着舒服。这景色使旅人忘掉了锱铢必较的铜臭，他已经因此而透不过气来了。</div>

<div class="left">Such is the Mayor of Verrieres, M. de Renal. Crossing the street with a solemn step, he enters the town hall and passes from the visitor's sight.But, a hundred yards higher up, if the visitor continues his stroll, he will notice a house of quite imposing appearance, and, through the gaps in an iron railing belonging to the house, some splendid gardens. Beyond,there is a line of horizon formed by the hills of Burgundy, which seem to have been created on purpose to delight the eye. This view makes the visitor forget the <a href="#" title=" [.pestɪ'lenʃ(ə)l]

    adj.极讨厌的；极烦人的；瘟疫的；引起瘟疫的
    瘟疫般的；有害的；传染病的">pestilential</a> atmosphere of small financial interests which was beginning to stifle him.</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">有人告诉他，这幢房子属于德.莱纳先生，刚刚落成。这方石砌就的漂亮住宅是维里埃的市长用他那座大制钉厂赚来的。据说他祖上是西班牙人，是个古老的家族，似乎早在路易十四征服此地之前就已定居下来。</div>

<div class="left">He is told that this house belongs to M. de Renal. It is to the profits that he has made from his great nail factory that the Mayor of Verrieres is indebted for this fine freestone house which he has just finished building. His family, they say, is Spanish,old, and was or claims to have been established in the country long before Louis XIV conquered it.</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">自从一八一五年起，他就耻于再作工厂主了，因为一八一五年使他当上了维里埃的市长。那座极美的花园有好几层，直伸到杜河岸边，每一层都筑有护墙，这也是对德.莱纳先生在铁器买卖中的精明给予的酬报。</div>
  
  <div class="left">Since 1815 he has blushed at his connection with industry: 1815 made him Mayor of Verrieres. The retaining walls that support the various sections of this splendid garden, which, in a succession of terraces, runs down to the Doubs, are also a reward of M. de Renal's ability as a dealer in iron.</div>
</div>
  <div class="layout">
<div class="right">在法国，您别指望看见德国的莱比锡、法兰克福、纽伦堡等工业城市周围那种秀丽别致的花园。在弗朗什－孔泰，愈是砌墙，愈是在地产上堆起一层层的石头，就愈是有权受到邻人的尊敬。德.莱纳先生的花园里便是高墙纵横，尤其是里面有几小块地，是他花了大价钱才买下的，这花园就更加令人赞赏了。就说那个锯木厂吧，它在杜河岸边的特殊位置让您一进城就留下深刻的印象，您也注意到屋顶一块大木板上用极大的字写着“索莱尔”这姓氏，而在这块六年前还是锯木厂的土地上，眼下正在修筑花园第四层平台的护墙。</div>

    <div class="left">You must not for a moment expect to find in France those picturesque gardens which enclose the manufacturing towns of Germany; Leipsic,Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and the rest. In the Franche-Comte, the more walls a man builds, the more he makes his property bristle with stones piled one above another, the greater title he acquires to the respect of his neighbours. M. de Renal's gardens, honeycombed with walls, are still further admired because he bought, for their weight in gold, certain minute scraps of ground which they cover. For instance that sawmill whose curious position on the bank of the Doubs struck you as you entered Verrieres, and on which you noticed the name Sorel, inscribed in huge letters on a board which overtops the roof, occupied, six years ago,the ground on which at this moment they are building the wall of the
fourth terrace of M. de Renal's gardens.
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">市长先生固然高傲，却不得不费些心力央求老索莱尔那个既冷酷又顽固的农民，不得不付给他明晃晃的金路易，才使他把工厂迁往别处。至于那条使锯子转动起来的公共水流，则是他利用自己在巴黎的影响让它改了道。这个恩惠是他在一八二×年选举之后得到的。德.莱纳先生为了这块一阿尔邦的地，把杜河下游五百步处的四阿尔邦给了索莱尔。尽管这块地的位置对他的枞木板生意有利得多，索老爹（自打他发了，他就有了这称呼）还是巧妙地利用了这位邻居的急迫和占有欲，敲了他六千法朗。</div>
  
  <div class="left">For all his pride, the Mayor was obliged to make many overtures to old Sorel, a dour and obstinate peasant; he was obliged to pay him in fine golden louis before he would consent  to remove his mill elsewhere.As for the public lade which supplied power to the saw, M. de Renal,thanks to the influence he wielded in Paris, obtained leave to divert it.This favour was conferred upon him after the 182- elections.
He gave Sorel four acres in exchange for one, five hundred yards lower down by the bank of the Doubs. And, albeit this site was a great deal more advantageous for his trade in planks of firwood, Pere Sorel, as they have begun to call him now that he is rich, contrived to screw out of the impatience and landowning mania which animated his neighbour a sum of 6,000 francs.
</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">果然，这笔交易受到当地一些有识之士的非议。有一次，四年以后的一个礼拜天，德.莱纳先生身着市长礼服从教堂回家，远远地看见老索莱尔由三个儿子护着，正看着他笑呢。这一笑使市长先生恍然大悟，他从此就老是想，他原本可以更便宜地做成这笔交易呀。</div>
  
  <div class="left">It is true that this arrangement was adversely criticised by the local wiseacres. On one occasion, it was a Sunday, four years later, M. de Renal, as he walked home from church in his mayoral attire, saw at a distance old Sorel, supported by his three sons, watching him with a smile.That smile cast a destroying ray of light into the Mayor's soul; ever since then he has been thinking that he might have brought about the exchange at less cost to himself.
</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">在维里埃，要造许多的护墙，才能获得公众的敬重，要紧的是不要采用那些每年春天经由汝拉山口去往巴黎的泥瓦匠带来的意大利图纸，否则，这样一种革新将给鲁莽的造墙者带来标新立异的坏名声，永远洗刷不掉，他在那些明智而稳健的人眼中也就永远地身败名裂了，因为正是这些人在弗朗什—孔泰握有敬意的予夺之权。</div>
  
  <div class="left">To win popular esteem at Verrieres, the essential thing is not to adopt (while still building plenty of walls) any plan of construction brought
from Italy by those masons who in spring pass through the gorges of the Jura on their way to Paris. Such an innovation would earn the rash builder an undying reputation for wrongheadedness, and he would be lost forever among the sober  and moderate folk who create reputations in the Franche-Comte.
</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="right">事实上，这些明智之士在当地施行着最讨厌的专制；正是由于这个丑恶的字眼，对于那些在世称伟大的共和国的巴黎生活过的人来说，小城市里的日子简直不堪忍受。舆论的专横，而且是怎样一种舆论啊！在法国的小城市和在美利坚合众国是一样地愚蠢。</div>
  
  <div class="left">As a matter of fact, these sober folk  wield there the most irritating form of despotism; it is owing to that vile word that residence in small towns is intolerable to anyone who has lived in that great republic which we call Paris. The tyranny of public opinion (and what an opinion!) is as fatuous in the small towns of France as it is in the United States of America.</div>
