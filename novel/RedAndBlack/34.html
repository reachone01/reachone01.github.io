  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>If  everything seemed strange to Julien, in the noble drawing-room of the Hotel de  La Mole, the young man himself, pale and dressed in black, seemed in turn  highly singular to those who deigned to notice him. Madame de La Mole suggested  that her husband should send him away on business upon days when certain  personages were coming to dine.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>如果说于连觉得德·拉莫尔府高贵的客厅里的一切都很怪，那么，他这个脸色苍白、身穿黑衣的年轻人，在肯注意他的那些人后来，也是很特别的。德·拉莫尔夫人向她丈夫建议，在有要人来吃饭的日子里，把他打发出去办事。
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  should like to carry through the experiment,' replied the Marquis.'The  abbe Pirard maintains that we do wrong to crush the self-respect of the people  we admit into our households. One can lean only upon what resists, etc. There  is nothing wrong with this fellow except his uncouth appearance; he might be  deaf and dumb.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我想把试验进行到底，”侯爵答道。“彼拉神甫认为，我们伤害用在身边的人的自尊心，是不对的。一个人只能靠在有抵抗力的东西上……。此人之不合适不过是其生面孔罢了，反正是又聋又哑。”</p>


</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'If  I am to keep my bearings, I must,' Julien said to himself, 'write down the  names and a few words as to the character of the people I see appear in this  drawing-room.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“为了熟悉这里的情况，”于连心想，“我得把在这间客厅里见到的人的名字写下来，并对他们的性格写上一句话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  the head of his list he placed five or six friends of the family who paid a  desperate court to him, supposing him to be protected by some caprice of the  Marquis. These were poor devils, more or less spiritless; but, it must be said  in praise of men of this class as they are to be found today in the  drawing-rooms of the nobility, they were not equally spiritless to all comers.  Some of them would have let themselves be abused by the Marquis, and yet would  have revolted against a harsh word addressed to them by Madame de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他把这个家庭的五、六位朋友放在了第一行，他们以为他得到任性的侯爵的保护，就讨好他，以防万一。这是些穷人，多少有些庸俗乏味；不过也应该说句话，夸一夸今天还能在贵族客厅里见到的此类人物，他们并非在所有的人面前都一样地平庸乏味。他们中有的人甘心忍受侯爵的粗暴，但是德·拉莫尔夫人若说一句生硬的话，他们就会反抗。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  was too much pride, there was too much boredom in the character of both host  and hostess; they were too much in the habit of insulting people for their own  distraction, to be able to expect any true friends.But,  except on wet days, and in their moments of furious boredom, which were rare,  they were never to be found wanting in politeness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在这家主人的性格深处，有太多的骄傲和太多的烦闷；他们为了散心而习惯于侮辱别人，因此他们不能得到真正的朋友。然而，除了下雨天和极少的特别烦闷的日子外，人们总是觉得他们彬彬有礼。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>If  the five or six flatterers who treated Julien with such fatherly affection had  deserted the Hotel de La Mole, the Marquise would have been left to long hours  of solitude; and, in the eyes of women of her rank, solitude is a dreadful  thing: it is the badge of disgrace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>那五、六个清客对于连表示出一种父执般的友谊，如果他们不来德·拉莫尔府了，侯爵夫人就会面临长时间的孤独；而在这个地位的女人眼中，孤独是可怕的：这是失宠的标志。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis behaved admirably to his wife; he saw to it that her drawing-room was  adequately filled; not with peers, he found his new colleagues scarcely noble  enough to come to his house as friends, nor entertaining enough to be admitted  as subordinates.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵对妻子无可挑剔；他注意让她的客厅总有足够的人；不是那些贵族院议员，他觉得这些新同僚不够高贵，不能作为朋友来他家，又不够有趣，不能作为下属来接纳。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was not until much later that Julien discovered these secrets. The political  questions which form the chief topic in middle-class houses are never mentioned  in houses like that of the Marquis, save in times of trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连很久以后才了解这些内情。执政者的政策是资产者家庭的话题，而在侯爵这个阶级的家庭中，只有在身处困境之中才会论及。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>So  powerful still, even in this age of boredom, are the dictates of the need of  amusement, that even on the evenings of dinner-parties, as soon as the Marquis  had left the drawing-room, everyone else fled. So long as you did not speak  lightly of God, or of the clergy, or of the King, or of the men in power, or of  the artists patronised by the court, or of anything established; so long as you  did not say anything good of Beranger, or of the opposition press, or of  Voltaire, or of Rousseau, or of anything that allowed itself the liberty of a  little freedom of speech; so long, above all, as you did not talk politics, you  could discuss anything you pleased with freedom.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>寻欢作乐的需要，就是在这个百无聊棘的世纪，也支配着一切，因此，甚至在有晚宴的日子里，一旦侯爵离开客厅，大家也都逃之夭夭。只要不拿天主、教士、国王、在位的人、受宫廷保护的艺术家和一切即成的事情打哈哈，只要不说贝朗瑞、反对派报纸、伏尔泰、卢梭和一切胆敢稍许直言的人的好话，尤其绝口不谈政治，那就可以自由地谈论一切了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  is no income of a hundred thousand crowns, no blue riband that can prevail  against a drawing-room so constituted. The smallest living idea seemed an  outrage. Despite good tone, perfect manners, the desire to be agreeable,  boredom was written upon every brow. The young men who came to pay their  respects, afraid to speak of anything that might lead to their being suspected  of thinking, afraid to reveal some forbidden reading, became silent after a few  elegantly phrased sentences on Rossini and the weather.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>即使十万年金的收入，蓝绶带，也斗不过这种客厅的规矩。稍有一点生气的思想都似乎是一种粗鄙。尽管得体，彬彬有礼，想取悦于人，烦闷还是明摆在每个人的额头上。年轻人来此尽义务，害怕说到什么可能被怀疑为有思想的东西，或者害怕泄漏读过什么禁书，就说几句关于罗西尼和今天天气的漂亮话，随后即钳口不言。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  observed that the conversation was usually kept going by two Viscounts and five  Barons whom M. de La Mole had known during the Emigration. These gentlemen  enjoyed incomes of from six to eight thousand livres; four of them swore by the  Quotidienne, and three by the Gazette de France. One of them had some new story  to tell every day of the Chateau, in which the word 'admirable' was lavishly  used. Julien remarked that this man wore five Crosses, whereas the others, as a  rule, had no more than three.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连注意到，谈话通常由侯爵在流亡中结识的两位子爵和五位男爵撑着，才不至中断。这些先生们都有七、八千利弗尔年金的收入；四位支持《每日新闻》，三位支持《法兰西报》。其中一位每天都要讲个宫廷里的小故事，“了不起”这个词儿是免不了的。于连注意到他有五枚十字勋章，而其他几位一般只有三枚。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the other hand, you saw in the anteroom ten footmen in livery, and all through  the evening you had ices or tea every quarter of an hour; and, at midnight, a  sort of supper with champagne.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>此外，前厅有十名穿号衣的仆人，整个晚上，每隔一刻钟供应一次冰冻饮料或茶，午夜有一顿带香槟酒的夜宵。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was for this reason that Julien sometimes remained to the end; otherwise, he  failed to understand how anyone could listen seriously to the ordinary  conversation of this drawing-room, so magnificently gilded.Now  and again he would watch the speakers, to see whether they them selves were not  laughing at what they were saying. 'My M. de Maistre, whom I know by heart, has  said things a hundred times better,' he thought; 'and even he is extremely  boring.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>为此，于连有时候留下来一直到底；尽管这样，他几乎还是不理解，他们如何能在这间如此金碧辉煌的豪华客厅里一本正经地听那种平平常常的谈话。有时候，他望着说话的人，看他们自己也觉得是在信口开河。“我的德·迈斯特先生的著作我能背，他说得可要好上一百倍，”他想，“然而就是他也还令人生厌呢。”</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was not the only one to be aware of the mental stagnation. Some consoled  themselves by taking quantities of ices; the others with the pleasure of being  able to say for the rest of the evening: 'I have just come from the Hotel de La  Mole, where I heard that Russia', etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>觉察到这种精神窒息的，并非于连一个。为了自我宽解，有的人喝大量的冰镇饮料，有的人则在晚上剩下的时间里大谈：“我从德·拉莫尔府来，我知道了俄国如何如何……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  learned, from one of the flatterers, that less than six months ago Madame de La  Mole had rewarded an assiduity that had lasted for more than twenty years by  securing a Prefecture for poor Baron Le Bourguignon, who had been a Sub-Prefect  ever since the Restoration.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连从一个清客的嘴里知道，不到六个月前，德·拉莫尔夫人让复辞以来一直当专区区长的勒布吉尼翁男爵当上了省长，作为对他二十多年不懈的陪伴的奖赏。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  great event had rekindled the zeal of these gentlemen; the least thing might  have offended them before, now they were no longer offended by anything. It was  rare that the incivility was direct, but Julien had already overheard at table  two or three brief little passages between the Marquis and his wife, wounding  to those who were placed near them.These  noble personages did not conceal their sincere contempt for everyone that was  not the offspring of people who rode in the King's carriages. Julien observed  that the word Crusade was the only one that brought to their faces an  expression of intense seriousness, blended with respect. Their ordinary respect  had always a shade of condescension.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这件大事重新激起了这些先生们的热忱；从前他们为之生气的事情不多，现在则一点儿也没有了。对他们缺乏敬重，这很少直接表现出来，但是于连在饭桌上有两三次无意中听见侯爵夫妇间的闲谈，很简短，却对坐在他们身边的人很残酷。这些高贵的人物并不掩饰他们对所有那些不是坐过国王马车的人的后代所怀有的真诚的轻蔑。于连注意到，唯有十字军东征这个词才能使他们的脸上现出夹杂着敬意的极严肃的表情。通常表现出来的敬意总带有讨好的味道。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  the midst of this magnificence and this boredom, Julien was interested in  nothing but M. de La Mole; he listened with pleasure one day to his  protestations that he was in no way responsible for the promotion of that poor  Le Bourguignon. This was a delicate attention to the Marquise:Julien  had learned the truth from the abbe Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在这豪华和烦闷之中，于连除了德·拉莫尔侯爵以外，对什么都不感兴趣；一天，于连高兴地听见他声称，在可怜的勒布吉尼翁晋升这件事上，他没出过一点儿力。原来这是对侯爵夫人献的一个殷勤，于连从彼拉神甫那儿知道了事情的真相。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  morning when the abbe was working with Julien, in the Marquis's library, on the  endless litigation with Frilair:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一天早晨，神甫和于连在侯爵的图书室里处理那桩没完没了的福利莱评讼案。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir,'  said Julien suddenly, 'is dining every evening with Madame la Marquise one of  my duties, or is it a favour that they show me?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，”于连突然说，“每天和侯爵夫人一起吃晚饭，这是我的一个义务呢，还是人家对我的一种厚爱？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is a signal honour!' replied the abbe, greatly shocked. 'M. N——, the  Academician, who has been paying assiduous court for the last fifteen years,  has never been able to obtain it for his nephew M. Tanbeau.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是莫大的荣幸！”神甫生气地说，“院士Ｎ．先生十五年来一直百般讨好，却从未能替他的侄子唐博先生争到过。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is to me, Sir, the most tedious part of my employment. I was less bored at the  Seminary. I see even Mademoiselle de La Mole yawn at times, although she must  be accustomed to the pretty speeches of the friends of the family. I am afraid  of falling asleep. Please be so good as to obtain leave for me to go and dine  for forty sous in some obscure inn.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“对我来说，先生，这却是我的职务中最难以忍受的部分。我在神学院里也没有这么厌倦。我有几次看见连德·拉莫尔小姐都在打哈欠，她倒是应该对她们家的那些朋友的殷勤习以为常的，我真怕睡着了。求求您，让他们允许我到哪一家无名小店里吃四十个苏一顿的晚饭吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe, a regular parvenu, was highly sensible of the honour of dining with a  great nobleman. While he was endeavouring to make Julien understand what he  felt, a slight sound made them turn their heads. Julien saw Mademoiselle de La  Mole who was listening. He blushed. She had come in search of a book and had  heard everything; she felt a certain respect for Julien. 'This fellow was not  born on his knees,' she thought, 'like that old abbe. Heavens! How ugly he is.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>神甫是个真正的暴发户，对和大贵人共进晚餐这种荣幸非常看重。正当他竭力让于连懂得这种感情时，一阵轻微的声音传来，他们转过头。于连看见德·拉莫尔小姐在听。他脸红了。她来找一本书，什么都听到了；她对于连有了几分敬意。“此人不是生来下跪的，”她想，“不像这个老神甫。天主！他真丑。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  dinner, Julien dared not look at Mademoiselle de La Mole, but she was so kind  as to speak to him. That evening, they expected a large party; she made him  promise to remain. Girls in Paris do not care for men of a certain age,  especially when they are not well dressed. Julien did not require much sagacity  to perceive that M. Le Bourguignon's colleagues, who remained in the  drawing-room, had the honour to be the customary butt of Mademoiselle de La  Mole's wit. That evening, whether with deliberate affectation or not, she was  cruel in her treatment of the bores.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚饭时，于连不敢看德·拉莫尔小姐，她却亲切地跟他说话。那一天人很多，她要他留下。巴黎的女孩子不大喜欢那些上了点儿年纪的男人，尤其是当他们衣冠不整的时候。于连用不着很多的洞察力，就看出德·拉莫尔小姐平时取笑的目标这次有幸落在了滞留在客厅里的勒布吉尼翁的同僚头上。这一天，不管她是不是装腔作势，反正她对那些令人厌倦的人是残酷的。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole was the centre of a little group that assembled almost every evening  behind the Marquise's immense armchair.There,  you would find the Marquis de Croisenois, the Comte de Caylus, the Vicomte de  Luz and two or three other young officers, friends of Norbert or his sister.  These gentlemen sat upon a large blue sofa. At the end of the sofa, opposite to  that occupied by the brilliant Mathilde, Julien was silently installed upon a  little cane-bottomed chair with a low seat.This  modest post was the envy of all the flatterers; Norbert kept his father's young  secretary in countenance by addressing him or uttering his name once or twice  in the course of the evening. On this occasion, Mademoiselle de La Mole asked  him what might be the height of the mountain on which the citadel of Besancon  stood. Julien could not for the life of him have said whether this mountain was  higher or lower than Montmartre. Often he laughed heartily at what was being  said in the little group; but he felt himself incapable of thinking of anything  similar to say. It was like a foreign language which he could understand, but  was unable to speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·拉莫尔小姐是一个小圈子的核心，这个小圈子几乎每天晚上都在侯爵夫人那把大安乐椅的后面。那里有德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵，德·凯吕斯伯爵，德·吕兹子爵和两、三位年轻军官，不是诺贝尔的就是他妹妹的朋友。这些先生们坐在一张蓝色大沙发上。在沙发的一端，于连不声不响地坐在一把相当矮的小草垫椅子上，正对着坐在沙发另一端的光彩照人的玛蒂尔德。这个不起限的位置受到所有那些献殷勤的人的歆羡；诺贝尔把他父亲的年轻秘书留在那儿，或者说说话，或者晚会上提一两次他的名字，倒也合乎情理。这一天，德·拉莫尔小姐问他，贝藏松城堡所在的那座山有多高。于连从来就说不清这座山是不是高过蒙特玛尔高地。这小圈子里人们说的话常使他开怀大笑，他自觉无力想出类似的话来。好像一种外国话，他听得慌，却说不出。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde's  friends were that evening in a state of constant hostility towards the people  who kept arriving in this vast drawing-room. The friends of the family had the  preference at first, being better known. One can imagine whether Julien was  attentive; everything interested him, both the things themselves, and the way  they were made to seem ridiculous.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德的朋友们这一天持续不断地和来到这个豪华客疗的人作对。这个家庭的那些朋友们首先被选作目标，因为更熟悉。可以想见于连是多么专心；他对什么都感兴趣，无论拿来取笑的事情的内容，还是取笑的方式。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  Here comes M. Descoulis,' said Mathilde; 'he has left off his wig; can he be  hoping to secure a Prefecture by his genius? He is exposing that bald brow  which he says is filled with lofty thoughts.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！德库利先生来啦，”玛蒂尔德说，“他不戴假发了；难道他想凭着才华当上省长吗？他炫耀他那光秃秃的额头，说那里面装满了高超的思想。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  is a man who knows the whole world,' said the Marquis de Croisenois; 'he comes  to my uncle, the Cardinal's, too. He is capable of cultivating a lie with each  of his friends, for years on end, and he has two or three hundred friends. He  knows how to foster friendship, that is his talent. You ought to see him,  covered in mud, at the door of a friend's house, at seven o'clock on a winter  morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个人没有他不认识的，”德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵说，“他也到我叔叔红衣主教那儿去。他能连续数年在每个朋友面前编造谎言，而他的朋友有二、三百之多。他善于增进友谊，这是他的才能。就像你们现在看见的那样，冬天早晨七点钟，他已满身泥巴地来到一位朋友的家门口。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  hatches a quarrel, now and again, and writes seven or eight letters to keep up  the quarrel. Then he is reconciled, and produces seven or eight letters for the  transports of affection. But it is in the frank and sincere expansion of an  honest man who can keep nothing on his conscience that he shines most. This is  his favourite device when he has some favour to ask. One of my uncle's  Vicars-General is perfect when he relates the life of M. Descoulis since the  Restoration. I shall bring him to see you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他时不时地跟人闹翻，然后又写上七、八封信。接着，他跟人言归于好，为了热情洋溢的友谊又写上七、八封信。但他最出众的是像个胸无纤尘的有教养的人那样倾诉衷肠。当他有求于人时，这种花招就使出来了。我叔叔的那些代理主教中有一位讲起德库利先生复辟以来的生活，真是精彩极了。我以后把他带来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Bah!  I shouldn't listen to that talk; it is the professional jealousy of small-minded people,' said the Comte de  Caylus.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“得了吧！这种话我才不信呢；这是小人物之间的职业性嫉妒，”德·凯吕斯伯爵说。</p>

</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'M.  Descoulis will have a name in history,' the Marquis went on; 'he made the  Restoration with the Abbe de Pradt and M. Talleyrand and Pozzo di Borgo.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“德库利先生会在历史上留名的，”侯爵又说；“他跟德·普拉特神甫以及塔列兰、波佐·迪·波尔戈两位先生造成了复辟。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  man has handled millions,' said Norbert, 'and I cannot conceive why he comes  here to swallow my father's epigrams, which are often appalling. &quot;How many  times have you betrayed your friends, my dear Descoulis?&quot; he shouted at  him the other day, down the whole length of the table.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“此人曾经掌管过好几百万，”诺贝尔说，“我想不出他为什么来这儿忍受我父亲的那些常常是很讨厌的俏皮话。‘您出卖过多少回朋友，我亲爱的德库利先生？’有一天他从饭桌的一头朝另一头嚷道。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  is it true that he has betrayed people?' said Mademoiselle de La Mole. 'Who is  there that has not?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他真的出卖过吗？”德·拉莫尔小姐说，“谁没有出卖过？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!'  said the Comte de Caylus to Norbert, 'you have M. Sainclair here, the notorious  Liberal; what the devil can he have come for? I must go over to him, and talk  to him, and make him talk; they say he is so clever.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“怎么！”德·凯吕斯伯爵对诺贝尔说，“森克莱尔先生，这个著名的自由党人，也到你们家来；见鬼，他上这几来干什么？我得到他那儿去，跟他谈谈，让他说话；据说他颇有风趣。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  how can your mother have him in the house?' said M de Croisenois. 'His ideas  are so extravagant, so enthusiastic, so independent… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过，你母亲会如何接待他呢？”德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵说，“他有些思想是那么怪诞，那么大胆，那么无拘无束……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Look,'  said Mademoiselle de La Mole, 'there is your independent man, bowing to the  ground before M. Descoulis, and seizing his hand. I almost thought he was going  to raise it to his lips.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“看哪，”德·拉莫尔小姐说，“那个无拘无束的人在向德库利先生鞠躬，都挨着地了，还握住了他的手。我几乎要以为他会把这手举到唇边哩。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Descoulis  must stand better with the authorities than we thought,' put in M. de  Croisenois.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一定是德库利跟当局的关系比我们想象的要好，”德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>“我亲爱的索莱尔，  &quot;诺贝尔说，“您有才智，但您是从您那个山里来的，您要努力做到，千万别像这个大诗人那样向人致敬，哪怕是对天主。”</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>'Ah!  Here comes a man of brains if you like, M. le Baron Baton,' said Mademoiselle  de La Mole, imitating the voice of the footman who had just announced him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！来了一个特别有才智的人，巴东男爵先生，”德·拉莫尔小姐说，多少有些模仿通报他到来的仆人的腔调。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  think even your servants laugh at him. What a name, Baron Baton!' said M. de  Caylus.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>'&quot;What's  in a name?&quot; as he said to us the other day,' retorted Mathilde.'&quot;Imagine  the Duc de Bouillon announced for the first time. All the public needs, in my  case, is to have grown accustomed to it.&quot;'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“名字有什么关系？”有一天他对我们说，”玛蒂尔德又说，“‘想想第一次通报布庸公爵时的情形吧：就我的情况而言，大家只是不大习惯罢了……’”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  quitted the circle round the sofa. Still but little sensible of the charming  subtleties of a light-handed mockery, if he were to laugh at a witticism, he  required that it should be founded on reason. He could see nothing in the talk  of these young men, but the tone of general depreciation, and this shocked him.  His provincial or English prudery went so far as to detect envy in it, wherein  he was certainly mistaken.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连离开了沙发周围的人。他对轻松的嘲笑所具有的那种动人的微妙还不大敏感，他认为一句玩笑话必须合情合理，才能引人发笑。在这些年轻人的话里，他只看见一种诋毁一切的口吻，因此感到不快。他那外省人的或者英国式的故作正经甚至使他从中看到了嫉妒，这肯定是他错了。</p>
</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Comte  Norbert,' he said to himself, 'whom I have seen make three rough copies of a  letter of twenty lines to his Colonel, would be very glad to have written a  single page in his life like those of M. Sainclair.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“诺贝尔伯爵，”他心里说，“他写一封二十行的信给他的上校，竟打了三次草稿，他若是一生中能写森克莱尔那样的一页，肯定会感到很高兴的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Passing  unperceived owing to his lack of importance, Julien approached several groups  in turn; he was following Baron Baton at a distance, and wished to hear him  talk. This man of such intelligence wore a troubled air, and Julien saw him  recover himself a little only when he had hit upon three or four sparkling sentences.  It seemed to Julien that this kind of wit required ample room to develop  itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连无足轻重，不引人注意，接连走近好几个圈子；他远远地跟着巴东男爵，想听他说什么。这个颇具才情的人神色紧张不安，于连见他只是找到三、四句风趣的话之后，才略微恢复正常。于连觉得此类才智需要足够的空间。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Baron could not produce epigrams; he required at least four sentences of six  lines each to be brilliant.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>巴东男爵不能说单字；为了出语惊人，他一张口至少得四个每句六行的长句。
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  man is holding forth, he is not talking,' said someone behind Julien's back. He  turned round and flushed with pleasure when he heard the name of Comte Chalvet.  This was the cleverest man of the day. Julien had often come upon his name in  the Memorial de Sainte Helene and in the fragments of history dictated by  Napoleon. Comte Chalvet was curt in his speech; his remarks were flashes of  lightning, accurate, keen, profound. If he spoke of any public matter,  immediately one saw the discussion reach a fresh stage. He brought facts to  bear on it, it was a pleasure to listen to him. In politics, however, he was a  brazen cynic.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“此人是在做论文，不是在聊天，”一个人在于连背后说。他转过身，听见有人说出夏尔维伯爵的名字，高兴得脸都红了。这是本世纪最精明的人。于连在《圣赫勒拿岛回忆录》和拿破仑口授的史料片断里经常看见他的名字。夏尔维伯爵说话简洁；他的俏皮话是闪电，准确，锐利，有时深刻。他如果谈一个问题，讨论立刻就会前进一步。他还提出事实，听他说话真是一冲乐趣。此外，在政治上，他是一个厚颜无耻的犬儒主义者。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I am independent, myself,' he was saying to a  gentleman wearing three decorations, whom he was apparently quizzing. 'Why  should I be expected to hold the same opinion today that I held six weeks ago?  If I did, I should be a slave to my opinion.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我是独立的，”他对一位佩带二枚勋章而他显然不放在眼里的先生说，“为什么人们要我今天的意见和六个星期前一样呢？如果那样的话，我的意见就成了我的暴君啦。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Four  grave young men who stood round him made grimaces at this; these gentlemen do  not care for the flippant style. The Comte saw that he had gone too far.  Fortunately he caught sight of the honest M. Balland, a tartuffe of honesty.  The Comte began talking to him: people gathered round them, guessing that poor  Balland was going to be scarified. By dint of morals and morality, although  horribly ugly, and after early struggles with the world which it would be hard  to describe, M. Balland had married an extremely rich wife, who died; then a  second extremely rich wife, who was never seen in society. He enjoyed in all  humility an income of sixty thousand livres, and had flatterers of his own.  Comte Chalvet spoke to him of all this, without pity. Presently they were  surrounded by a circle of thirty people. Everyone smiled, even the grave young  men, the hope of the age.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>四个神色庄重的年轻人围着他，板着脸；这些先生们不喜欢开玩笑。伯爵看出来他走得太远了。幸好他瞧见了诚实的巴朗先生，其实是个假装诚实的伪君子。伯爵找他搭话，大家围拢来，知道可怜的巴朗要倒霉了。巴朗先生虽然丑得可怕，但是靠了道德和品行，在踏进社会的难对人言的头几步之后，娶了个很有钱的老婆，老婆又死了；接着娶了第二个很有钱的老婆，不过人们从未在社交场合见过。他极谦卑地享用着六万法郎的年金，自己也有些奉承者。夏尔维伯爵跟他谈起这一切，不留情面。很快有三十个人在他们身边围成了一个圈子。所有的人都面带微笑，甚至本世纪的希望、那几个神色庄重的年轻人也不例外。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why  does he come to M. de La Mole's, where he is obviously made a butt?' thought  Julien. He went across to the abbe Pirard, to ask him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他在德·拉莫尔先生家里显然成了取笑的对象，为什么还要来呢？”于连想。他走近彼拉神甫，想问问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  Balland left the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>巴朗先生溜了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Good!'  said Norbert, 'there's one of my father's spies gone; that leaves only the  little cripple Napier.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好！”诺贝尔说，“侦察我父亲的一个密探走了，只剩下小瘸子纳皮埃了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Can  that be the clue to the riddle?' thought Julien. 'But, in that case, why does  the Marquis invite M. Balland?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这会不会就是谜底呢？”于连想，“但是，这样的话，侯爵为什么还接待巴朗先生呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  stern abbe Pirard was making faces in a corner of the room, as he heard fresh  names announced.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>严厉的彼拉神甫板着脸，呆在客厅的一个角落里，听着仆人的通报。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why,  it is a den,' he said, like Basilic, 'I see none but villains enter.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这儿简直成了藏污纳垢之所，”他像巴斯勒那样说，“我看见来的都是些声名狼藉之人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  fact was that the stern abbe did not recognise the distinguishing marks of good  society. But, from his Jansenist friends, he had a very accurate notion of the  men who make their way into drawing-rooms only by their extreme cleverness in  the service of all parties, or by a fortune of notorious origin. For some  minutes, that evening, he replied from the abundance of his heart to Julien's  eager questions, then cut himself short, distressed to find himself speaking  ill of everyone, and imputing it to himself as a sin. Being choleric and a Jansenist,  and regarding Christian charity as a duty, his life in society was a perpetual  conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这是因为严厉的神甫不知道上流社会是怎么回事。但是，通过他的那些詹森派的朋友，他对这些靠了为所有党派效劳的极端的狡猾或者靠了不义之财方得进入客厅的人有了一个准确的概念。这天晚上，他感情冲动地回答于连迫不及待地提出的问题，几分钟后又突然打住，因总是说所有的人的坏话而深感痛苦，并且看成是自己的罪过。他易怒，信奉詹森派教义，并且相信基督徒有以仁爱为怀的职责，因此他在上流社会的生活是一场战斗。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  frightful that abbe Pirard looks!' Mademoiselle de La Mole was saying, as  Julien returned to the sofa.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个彼拉神甫有怎样一张脸啊！”于连走近沙发时，德·拉莫尔小姐说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  felt a sting of irritation, and yet she was right. M. Pirard was beyond  question the most honest man in the room, but his blotched face, distorted by  the pangs of conscience, made him hideous at the moment.'Never  judge by appearances after this,' thought Julien; 'it is at the moment when the  abbe's scruples are reproaching him with some peccadillo that he looks  terrible; whereas on the face of that Napier, whom everyone knows to be a spy,  one sees a pure and tranquil happiness.' The abbe Pirard had nevertheless made  a great concession to his party; he had engaged a valet, and was quite well  dressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连感到被激怒了，不过她说得倒也有理。彼拉先生无可争议地是客厅里最正直的人，然而他那张患酒糟鼻的脸因良心的折磨而抽动不已，此时变得非常难看。“在这之后您如何还能相信外貌，”于连想；“彼拉神甫心地高尚，他为了一点小过就自责，这时他的脸色让人看了害怕；而那个尽人皆知的密探纳皮埃，脸上却现出一种纯洁平静的幸福之感。”然而，彼拉神甫已经向他那一派做出重大让步，他用了一个仆人，而且穿得很好。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  remarked a singular occurrence in the drawing-room: this was a general movement  of all eyes towards the door, with a lull in the conversation. A footman  announced the famous Baron de Tolly, to whom the recent elections had attracted  universal attention. Julien moved forward and had an excellent view of him. The  Baron was returning officer in a certain constituency: he had had the bright  idea of making away with the little slips of paper bearing the votes of one of  the parties. But, to compensate for this, he duly replaced them with other  little slips of paper bearing a name of which he himself approved. This  decisive manoeuvre was observed by some of the electors, who lost no time in  presenting their compliments to Baron de Tolly. The worthy man was still pale  after his great excitement. Evil tongues had uttered the word galleys. M. de La  Mole received him coldly. The poor Baron hurriedly made his escape.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连注意到客厅里出现了一件奇怪的事：所有的眼睛都朝向门口，谈话的声音也骤然低了一半。仆人通报臭名昭著的德·托利男爵到来，最近的选举把所有的目光都集中在他身上。于连走上前去，把他看了个清清楚楚。男爵主持一个选区：他想出一个高明的主意，把投某一党派票的小方纸片偷出来，为了补足，再用同等数量的其它纸片替换，上面写上他中意的名字。这个决定性的花招被几个选民看破，他们急忙向德·托利男爵表示祝贺。这件大事之后，此公的脸色到现在还是苍白。有些居心不良的人甚至说出了苦役这个词。德·拉莫尔先生冷冷地接待了他。可怜的男爵逃之夭夭。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If he leaves us so soon, it must be to  go to M. Comte's,' said Comte Chalvet; and the others laughed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他这么快离开我们，是为了到孔特先生家里去，”夏尔维伯爵说，大家都笑了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Amid  a crowd of great noblemen who remained silent, and of intriguers, mostly  disreputable, but all of them clever fellows, who arrived one after another  that evening, in M. de La Mole's drawing-room (people were speaking of him for  a vacant Ministry), young Tanbeau was winning his spurs. If he had not yet  acquired any fineness of perception, he made up for the deficiency, as we shall  see, by the vigour of his language.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在几位沉默的大贵人和一些大部分声名狼籍、全都机智俏皮的阴谋家中间，小唐博初试身手。虽然他还没有精细的眼光，但是他有有力的言辞，人们就会看到，足以弥补这个缺点。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why  not sentence the man to ten years' imprisonment?' he was saying at the moment  when Julien joined his group; 'it is in a dungeon under ground that we ought to  keep reptiles shut up; they must be made to die in the dark, otherwise their  venom spreads and becomes more dangerous. What is the good of fining him a  thousand crowns? He is poor, very well, all the better; but his party will pay  the fine for him. It should have been a fine of five hundred francs and ten  years in a dungeon.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为什么不判此人十年监禁？”他在于连走近他那一堆人的时候说，“关毒蛇的应该是地牢；应该让它们在黑暗中死亡，否则其毒液会变得更猛烈更危险。罚他一千埃居有什么用？他穷，就算是吧，那更好；他的党派会替他付的。应该罚款五百法郎和地牢监禁十年。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Good  God! Who can the monster be that they are discussing?' thought Julien,  marvelling at his colleague's vehement tone and stilted gestures.The  thin, drawn little face of the Academician's favourite nephew was hideous as he  spoke. Julien soon learned that the person in question was the greatest poet of  the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“善良的天主啊！他们说的这个怪物究竟是谁呢？”于连想，他很欣赏这位同事的激烈的语气和急剧而生硬的手势。院士心爱的侄子的小脸枯瘦憔悴，这时显得很丑。于连很快知道他们说的是当今最伟大的诗人。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah,  monster!' exclaimed Julien, half aloud, and generous tears sprang to his eyes.  'Ah, little wretch, I shall make you eat those words.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊，坏蛋！”于连喊道，声音挺高，愤慨的泪水湮湿了眼睛。“啊，小无赖！”他想，“我会让你为这番话付出代价。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  yet these,' he thought, 'are the waifs and strays of the party of which the  Marquis is one of the leaders! And that illustrious man whom he is slandering,  how many Crosses, how many sinecures might he not have collected, if he had  sold himself, I do not say to the lifeless Ministry of M. de Nerval, but to one  of those passably honest Ministers whom we have seen succeed one another in  office?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过，”他想，“这些人都是侯爵为其首脑之一的那个党派的敢死队呀！他诽谤的这个杰出人物，如果他出卖了自己，我不是说出卖给平庸的德·奈瓦尔先生的内阁，而是出卖给我们看见一个接一个上任的勉强算正直的部长们，多少十字勋章、多少清闲职位得不到呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe Pirard beckoned to Julien; M. de La Mole had just been saying something to  him. But when Julien, who at the moment was listening, with lowered gaze, to  the lamentations of a Bishop, was free to move, and able to join his friend, he  found him monopolised by that abominable young Tanbeau. The little monster  loathed him as the source of the favour that Julien enjoyed, and had come to  pay court to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>彼拉神甫远远地向于连示意，刚才德·拉莫尔先生跟他说了几句话。于连正低垂着眼晴听一位主教哀叹，当他终于能够脱身，走近他的朋友的时候，发现他被小唐博缠任了。这小坏蛋恨自己成了于连得庞的根由，便过来向他献殷勤。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'When  will death rid us of that old mass of corruption?' It was in these terms, with  Biblical emphasis, that the little man of letters was speaking at that moment  of the eminent Lord Holland. His chief merit was a thorough knowledge of the  biography of living men, and he had just been making a rapid survey of all  those who might aspire to positions of influence under the new King of England.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“死亡何时让我们摆脱这老废物呢？”小文人当时就是用的这种措词，以圣经般的力量谈论可敬的霍兰德勋爵。他的长处是熟知活人的生平，他刚刚急匆匆地评论了一番所有那些能够希望在英国新国王的统治下获得一些权势的人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe Pirard moved into an adjoining room; Julien followed him.</p>

彼拉神甫到隔壁一间客厅里去，于连跟着他。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  Marquis does not like scribblers, I warn you; it is his one antipathy. Know  Latin, Greek if you can, the History of the Egyptians, of the Persians, and so  forth; he will honour you and protect you as a scholar.But  do not go and write a single page in French, especially upon grave subjects,  that are above your position in society; he would call you a scribbler, and  would take a dislike to you. What, living in a great nobleman's mansion, don't  you know the Duc de Castries's saying about d'Alembert and Rousseau: &quot;That  sort of fellow wishes to argue about everything, and has not a thousand crowns  a year?&quot;'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我提醒您注意，侯爵不喜欢耍笔杆子的人；这是他唯一的反感。通晓拉丁文，如果可能，还有希腊文，通晓埃及历史，波斯历史，等等，他就会敬重您，像保护一个学者那样保护您。但是，不要用法文写一页东西，尤其不要写重大、超出您的社会地位的问题，不然他会把您称作要笔杆子的，让您交一辈子恶运。您住在一个大贵人的府上，怎么不知道德·卡斯特里公爵关于达朗贝尔和卢梭的名言：此辈什么都要议论，却连一千埃居的年金也没有！”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Everything  becomes known,' thought Julien, 'here as in the Seminary.'He  had written nine or ten pages with distinct emphasis: they were a sort of  historical eulogy of the old Surgeon-Major, who, he said, had made a man of  him. 'And that little copybook,' Julien said to himself, 'has always been kept  under lock and key.' He went upstairs, burned his manuscript and returned to  the drawing-room. The brilliant rogues had departed, there remained only the  stars and ribands.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么也藏不住，”于连想，“这里和神学院一样！”他写了一篇八到十页的东西，相当夸张，是一种对老外科军医的历史性赞颂，他说是他把自己培养成人。“而这个小本子，”于连心想，“一直是锁着的呀！”他上楼回到自己房间，烧了手稿，又回到客厅。那些声名显赫的混蛋已经离去，只剩下那些戴勋章的人了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Round  the table, which the servants had just brought in already laid, were seated  seven or eight ladies, extremely noble, extremely religious, extremely  affected, between thirty and thirty-five years of age. The brilliant wife of  Marshal de Fervaques entered the room, apologising for the lateness of the  hour. It was after midnight; she took her place next to the Marquise. Julien  was deeply stirred; her eyes and her expression reminded him of Madame de  Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在仆人刚刚搬来的摆满吃食的桌子旁，围了七、八个三十到三十五岁很高贵、很虔诚、很做作的女人。光艳照人的德·费瓦克元帅夫人一边进来，一边为时间已晚致歉。午夜已过，她在侯爵夫人身边坐下。于连非常激动；她有着德·采纳夫人一样的眼睛和眼神。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  group round Mademoiselle de La Mole was still numerous. She and her friends  were engaged in making fun of the unfortunate Comte de Thaler. This was the only  son of the famous Jew, celebrated for the riches that he had acquired by  lending money to Kings to make war on the common people. The Jew had recently  died leaving his son a monthly income of one hundred thousand crowns, and a  name that, alas, was only too well known! This singular position required  either simplicity of character or great determination.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·拉莫尔小姐那一伙人还不少。她和她的朋友们正忙着取笑不幸的德·塔莱尔伯爵。他是那个大名鼎鼎的犹太人的独子，这犹太人的出名是靠了借给国王们钱向人民开战而获得的财富。他刚去世，留给儿子每月十万埃居的收入和一个姓氏，唉，一个太著名的姓氏。这种特殊的地位需要一个人具有单纯的性格和坚强的意志力。</p>

</div></div>

<p>Unfortunately,  the Comte was nothing but a good fellow, adorned with all sorts of pretensions  inspired in him by his flatterers.</p>

<p>M.  de Caylus asserted that he had been credited with the determination to propose  for the hand of Mademoiselle de La Mole (to whom the Marquis de Croisenois, who  was heir to a Dukedom with an income of one hundred thousand livres, was paying  court).</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·凯吕斯先主声称有人给了他向德·拉莫尔小姐求婚的意愿（德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵会成为有十万利弗尔年金的公爵，也在追求她。）</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>What  this poor Comte de Thaler most lacked was, perhaps, the power to determine  anything. In this respect, he would have made an excellent King. Taking advice  incessantly from everybody, he had not the courage to follow out any suggestion  to the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这可怜的德·塔莱尔伯爵最缺乏的，可能就是意愿的能力。就他的性格的这一面来说，他无槐于当国王。他不断地向所有的人讨主意，也就没有勇气始终听从任何一种意见了。</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>His  features would have been enough by themselves, said Mademoiselle de La Mole, to  fill her with everlasting joy. His face was a curious blend of uneasiness and  disappointment; but from time to time one could make out quite plainly bursts  of self-importance, combined with that cutting tone which the wealthiest man in  France ought to adopt, especially when he is by no means bad-looking, and is  not yet thirty-six.'He  is timidly insolent,' said M. de Croisenois. The Comte de Caylus, Norbert and  two or three young men with moustaches made fun of him to their hearts'  content, without his guessing it, and finally sent him away as one o'clock  struck.</p>

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐说，单单他的相貌就足以引起她无穷的快乐。那是一种惶恐不安和灰心丧气的奇怪混合；然而不时也可以清楚地看到一阵阵骄傲自大和那种法国最富有的人，特别是当他长得相当好并且不到三十六岁的时候所应有的专断口气。“他既傲慢又怯懦，”德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生说。德·凯吕斯伯爵，诺贝尔，还有两、三个留小胡子的年轻人，都尽情地嘲弄他，他却听不出来，最后，一点钟响了，他们就把他打发走了。</p>

<p>'Is  it your famous pair of arabs that you are keeping waiting in this weather?'  Norbert asked him.</p>

<p>“这样的天气，在门口等您的是您那些阿拉伯马吗？”诺贝尔问他。</p>

<p>'No,  I have a new pair that cost much less,' replied M. de Thaler. 'The near horse  cost me five thousand francs, and the off horse is only worth a hundred louis;  but I must have you understand that he is only brought out at night. The fact  is that he trots perfectly with the other.'</p>

<p>“不，是一组新买的拉车的马，便宜得多，”德·塔菜尔伯爵答道，“左边那匹花了我五千法郎，右边那匹只值一百路易；但是我请您相信，它只在夜里才套上。它小跑起来和另一匹完全一样。”</p>

<p>Norbert's  remark made the Comte think that it befitted a man in his position to have a  passion for horses, and that he ought not to allow his to stand in the rain. He  left, and the other gentlemen took their leave immediately, laughing at him as  they went.</p>

<p>诺贝尔的想法使伯爵想到，像他这样的人理应爱马，他不应该让他的马被雨淋着。他走了，那些先生们片刻之后也走了，还一边取笑他。</p>

<p>“就这样，”于连听见他们在楼梯上笑，想，“我有机会看见了我的处境的另一端！我没有二十路易的年金，却跟一个每个钟头就有二十路易收入的人站在一起，而他们嘲笑他……睹此可以医妒。”
