  <div class="left">It should be explained that the cure of Verrieres, an old man of eighty,but blessed by the keen air of his mountains with an iron character and strength, had the right to visit at any hour of the day the prison, the hospital, and even the poorhouse. It was at six o'clock in the morning precisely that M. Appert, who was armed with an introduction to the cure from Paris, had had the good sense to arrive in an inquisitive little town.He had gone at once to the presbytery.</div>
  
  <div class="right">维里埃的本堂神甫已是一位八十岁的老人，然而山里的新鲜空气给了他一副铁铸的体魄和性格。应该知道，他有权随时造访监狱，医院，甚至乞丐收容所。阿佩尔先生是巴黎方面向本堂神甫推荐的，他很聪明，恰好早晨六点钟到达一个居民很好奇的小城。他一到就直奔神甫住宅</div>
</div>



<div class="layout"><div class="left">As he read the letter addressed to him by M. le Marquis de La Mole, a Peer of France, and the wealthiest landowner in the province, the cure Chelan sat lost in thought.</div>

  <div class="right">谢朗神甫读着德.拉莫尔侯爵写给他的信，沉思良久。侯爵是法国贵族院议员，本省最大的地主。</div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'I am old and liked here,' he murmured to himself at length, 'they would never dare!' Turning at once to the gentleman from Paris, with eyes in which, despite his great age, there burned that sacred fire which betoken s the pleasure of performing a fine action which is slightly dangerous:</div>
  
  
  <div class="right">神甫暗自沉吟：“我一大把年纪了，并且在此地受人爱戴，他们不敢！”他立刻朝巴黎来的先生转过身。他虽然年事已高，两眼仍闪烁着火一样的热情，表明他乐于从事一桩多少有些危险的高尚行动。</div>
</div>



<div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Come with me, Sir, and, in the presence of the gaoler and especially of the superintendents of the poorhouse, be so good as not to express any opinion of the things we shall see.' M. Appert realised that he had to deal with a man of feeling; he accompanied the venerable cure, visited the prison, the hospital, the poorhouse, asked many questions and, notwithstanding strange answers, did not allow himself to utter the least word of reproach.</div>
  
  <div class="right">“跟我来，先生。请不要在看守面前特别是在乞丐收容所的管事面前发表任何意见，无论我们看到了什么。”阿佩尔先生明白他遇上了一个好心人：他跟着这位可敬的本堂神甫参观了监狱、医院和收容所，提出许多问题，尽管回答千奇百怪，他却忍住没有流露出任何指责的意思。</div>
</div>


  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This visit lasted for some hours. The cure invited M. Appert to dine with him, but was told that his guest had some letters to write: he did not wish to compromise his kind friend any further. About three o'clock,the gentlemen went back to complete their inspection of the poorhouse,after which they returned to the prison. There they found the gaoler standing in the doorway; a giant six feet tall, with bandy legs; terror had made his mean face hideous.</div>
  <div class="right">参观持续了好几个小时。神甫邀请阿佩尔先生共进午餐。阿佩尔先生不愿意更多地连累这位好心的朋友，就推说有几封信要写。三点钟前后，两位先生结束了对乞丐收容所的视察又回到监狱。他们在门口遇见了看守，这是一个巨人般的家伙，六尺高，罗圈腿，一张极难看的脸因恐惧而变得极可憎。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Ah, Sir,' he said to the cure, on catching sight of him, 'is not this gentleman, that I see with you, M. Appert?'

</div>
  <div class="right">“啊！先生，”他一看见神甫，就立刻对他说，“跟您在一起的这一位可是阿佩尔先生？”</div>
  </div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'What if he is?' said the cure.
</div>
  <div class="right">“是又怎么样？”神甫说。</div></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Because yesterday I received the most definite instructions, which the Prefect sent down by a gendarme  who had to gallop all night long, not to allow M. Appert into the prison.'
</div>
  <div class="right">“昨天我接到最明确的命令，不准阿佩尔先生进入监狱，命令是省长派一名宪兵送来的，他大概骑着马跑了一整夜呢。”</div></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'I declare to you, M. Noiroud,' said the cure, 'that this visitor, who is in my company, is M. Appert. Do you admit that I have the right to enter the prison at any hour of the day or night, bringing with me whom I please?'
</div>
  <div class="right">“我告诉您，诺瓦鲁先生，”神甫说，“跟我在—起的这位旅人正是阿佩尔先生。您承认不承认，我有权随时进入监狱，不管是白天还是晚上，并且愿意让谁陪同就让谁陪同？”
</div></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Yes, M. le cure,' the gaoler murmured in a subdued tone, lowering his head like a bulldog brought reluctantly to obedience by fear of the stick.
</div>
  <div class="right">“是的，神甫先生，”看守低声说，耷拉下脑袋，活像害怕挨棍子而勉强服从的一条狗。</div></div>
 
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Only, M. le cure, I have a wife and children, if I am reported I shall be dismissed; I have only my place here to live on.'
<p>'I too should be very sorry to lose mine,' replied the worthy cure, in a voice swayed by ever increasing emotion.</p>

<p>'What a difference!' the gaoler answered promptly; 'why you, M. le cure, we know that you have an income of 800 livres, a fine place in the sun… '
</div>
  <div class="right">“只是，神甫先生，我有老婆孩子，要是有人告发，他们会把我撤职的；我全靠这职位生活啊。”<p>“我的职位丢了我也很不高兴，”善良的神甫说，声音越来越激动。</p><p>“那可不一样啊！”看守急了，“您哪，神甫先生，谁都知道您有八百利弗尔的年金，一份上好的产业……”</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Such are the events which, commented upon, exaggerated in twenty different ways, had been arousing for the last two days all the evil passions of the little town of Verrieres. At that moment they were serving as text for the little discussion which M. de Renal was having with his wife.That morning, accompanied by M. Valenod, the governor of the poor house, he had gone to the cure's house, to inform him of their extreme displeasure. M. Chelan was under no one's protection; he felt the full force of their words.</div>
  <div class="right">这就是事情的原委，可两天来满城风雨，众说纷纭，更有人添枝加叶，在维里埃这座小城里搅动起各种充满仇恨的情绪。眼下德·莱纳先生和他妻子之间发生的小小争论，正是为了这件事。早晨，他带着乞丐收容所所长瓦勒诺先生去过本堂神甫家，向他表示最强烈的不满。谢朗先生没有任何后台，觉出了他们的话的份量。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Well, gentlemen, I shall be the third parish priest, eighty years of age,to be deprived of his living in this district. I have been here for six and fifty years; I have christened almost all the inhabitants of the town,which was no more than a village when I came. Every day I marry young couples whose grandparents I married long ago. Verrieres is my family; but I said to myself, when I saw the stranger: "This man, who has come from Paris, may indeed be a Liberal, there are far too many of them; but what harm can he do to our poor people and our prisoners?"'</div>
  <div class="right">“好吧，先生们！我已经八十岁了，我将是附近第三个被撤职的本堂神甫。我在此地已经五十六年；我为本城差不多全部居民行过洗礼，我来的时候这个城市还是个小镇呢。我每天都为年轻人主持婚礼，从前他们的祖父的婚礼也是我主持的。维里埃是我的家，但是我看见这个陌生人时心里想：‘这个人从巴黎来，也许真是个自由党人，那里可是太多了；但是他对我们的穷人和囚犯能有什么危害呢？’”</div></div>


  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The reproaches of M. de Renal, and above all those of M. Valenod, the governor of the poorhouse, becoming more and more bitter:</div>
  <div class="right">德·莱纳先生的指责，尤其是乞丐收容所所长瓦勒诺先生的指责，越来越凶了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Very well, gentlemen, have me deprived,' the old cure had cried, in a quavering voice. 'I shall live in the town all the same. You all know that forty-eight years ago I inherited a piece of land which brings me 800 livres; I shall live on that income. I save nothing out of my stipend, gentlemen, and that may be why I am less alarmed when people speak of taking it from me.'</div>
  <div class="right">“那好，先生们，把我撤了吧：“老神甫喊了起来，声音都发抖了。“可是我还要住在此地。大家知道我四十八年前继承了一片土地，每年有八百利弗尔的进项。我靠这些收入足以过活。我在任职期间可是没有任何积蓄，先生们，也许正因为如此，当有人跟我谈到撤职时，我才不那么害怕。”</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">M. de Renal lived on excellent terms with his wife; but not knowing what answer to make to the question, which she timidly repeated: 'What harm can this gentleman from Paris do to the prisoners?' he was just about to lose his temper altogether when she uttered a cry. Her second son had climbed upon the parapet of the wall of the terrace, and was running along it, though this wall rose more than twenty feet from the vineyard beneath. The fear of alarming her son and so making him fall restrained Madame de Renal from calling him. Finally the child, who was laughing at his own prowess, turned to look at his mother, noticed how pale she was, sprang down upon the avenue and ran to join her. He was well scolded.</div>
  <div class="right">德·莱纳先生与妻子相处极好，然而他不知道如何回答妻子怯生生地反复提出的问题：“巴黎来的这位先生能对囚犯有什么危害呢？”他简直要发火了，正在这时，妻子惊叫了一声。原来她的第二个儿子爬上了挡土墙的胸墙，还在上面跑，而这挡土墙高出墙外葡萄园有二十尺呢，德·莱纳夫人害怕孩子受到惊吓，掉下去，不敢跟他说话。那孩子正为自己的壮举得意呢，最后终于看到了母亲，见她面色如土，就跳到散步道上，朝她跑过去。他被好一个说。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This little incident changed the course of the conversation.</div>
  <div class="right">这个小小的事件扭转了谈话的方向。</div></div>


  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'I am quite determined to engage young Sorel, the sawyer's son,' said M. de Renal; 'he will look after the children, who are beginning to be too much of a handful for us. He is a young priest or thereabouts, a good Latin scholar, and will bring the children on; for he has a strong character, the cure says. I shall give him 300 francs and his board. I had some doubts as to his morals; for he was the Benjamin  of that old surgeon, the Member of the Legion of Honour who on pretence of being their cousin came to live with the Sorels. He might quite well have been nothing better than a secret agent of the Liberals; he said that our mountain air was good for his <a href="#" title="[ˈæsmə]
    n.【病】气喘
    哮喘；喘息；哮喘病">asthma</a>; but that has never been proved. He had served in all Buonaparte's campaigns in Italy, and they even say that he voted against the Empire in his day. This Liberal taught young Sorel Latin, and left him all the pile of books he brought here with him. Not that I should ever have dreamed of having the carpenter's son with my children; but the cure, only the day before the scene which has made a permanent breach between us, told me that this Sorel has been studying theology for the last three years, with the idea of entering the Seminary; so he is not a Liberal, and he is a Latin scholar.</div>
  <div class="right">“我一定要把锯木工的儿子索莱尔弄到家里来，”德·莱纳先生说，“让他照看孩子，他们越来越淘气，我们管不住了。他是个教士，不是也差不多，还精通拉丁文，他会让孩子们取得进步的，因为神甫说他性格坚强。我给他三百法郎，管他吃。我过去对他的品行一直有些猜疑，他是那个老外科医生，荣誉团骑士的宠儿，医生借口是亲戚，就住在他们家里。这个人实际上很可能是自由党的密探，他说我们山里的空气对他的风湿病有好处，可这并没有得到证实。他参过布奥纳巴尔德在意大利的历次战役，据说还曾签名反对建立帝国。这个自由党教小索莱尔拉丁文，还把带来的大量书籍留给他。所以我本来绝不会想到让木工的儿子和我们的孩子在一起的，可就在这场让我们闹翻的争吵的前一天，神甫对我说索菜尔攻读神学已经三年，准备进神学院，因此，他不是自由党人，他是个拉丁文学者。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'This arrangement suits me in more ways than one,' M. de Renal went on, looking at his wife with an air of diplomacy; 'Valenod is tremendously proud of the two fine Norman horses he has just bought for his calash . But he has not got a tutor for his children.'
<p>'He is quite capable of taking this one from us.'</p><p>'Then you approve of my plan?' said M. de Renal, thanking his wife,with a smile, for the excellent idea that had just occurred to her. 'There,that's settled.'<p>'Oh, good gracious, my dear, how quickly you make up your mind!'</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">“这样安排还有一个理由，”德·莱纳先生继续说，一边用一种外交家的神情看着妻子，“瓦勒诺刚刚给他的敞蓬四轮马车买下两匹诺曼底马，正得意着哪，可他没有给孩子请家庭教师。”
<p>“他会把我们的这一个抢走呀。”</p><p>“这么说你赞成我的计划喽？”德·菜纳先生说，朝她微微一笑，算是感谢她刚才的这个好主意。“好了，就这么定了。”<p>“啊，上帝！亲爱的朋友，你的决心下得这么快！”</p></div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'That is because I have a strong character, as the cure has had occasion to see. Let us make no pretence about it, we are surrounded by Liberals here. All these cloth merchants are jealous of me, I am certain of it; two or three of them are growing rich; very well, I wish them to see M. de Renal's children go by, out walking in the care of their tutor. It will make an impression. My grandfather used often to tell us that in his young days he had had a tutor. It's a hundred crowns he's going to cost me, but that will have to be reckoned as a necessary  expense to keep up our position.'</div>
  <div class="right">“这是因为我性格刚强，本堂神甫已经领教过了。我们不必隐瞒什么，我们在此地是被自由党人包围着的。所有那些布商都嫉妒我，我对此深信不疑；其中两三个正在阔起来；那好吧，我倒很喜欢让这些人看看德·莱纳先生的孩子怎样在他们的家庭教师带领下散步。不由他们不肃然起敬。我的祖父常对我说，他小时候就有一个家庭教师。这大概要花我一百个埃居，不过应该把这笔开支看作为了保持我们的身份所必需的。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This sudden decision  plunged Madame de Renal deep in thought. She was a tall, well-made woman, who had been the beauty of the place, as the saying is in this mountain district . She had a certain air of simplicity and bore herself like a girl; in the eyes of a Parisian, that artless grace,full of innocence and vivacity, might even have suggested ideas of amildly passionate nature. Had she had wind of this kind of success, Madame de Renal would have been thoroughly ashamed of it. No trace either of coquetry  or of affectation had ever appeared in her nature. M.Valenod, the wealthy governor of the poorhouse, was supposed to have paid his court to her, but without success, a failure which had given a marked distinction to her virtue; for this M. Valenod, a tall young man,strongly built, with a vivid complexion and bushy black whiskers, was one of those coarse, brazen, noisy creatures who in the provinces are called fine men.</div>
  <div class="right">德·莱那夫人沉思不语，这个决定太突然了。这女人身材高而苗条，曾经是当地有名的美人儿，山里人都这么说。她具有某种纯朴的仪态，举手投足仍透出一股青春的活力；在一位巴黎人看来，这种天真活泼的自然风韵甚至会唤起温柔的快感，让人想入非非，德·莱纳夫人若是知道自己会有这一类的成功，一定会羞得无地自容。什么卖弄风情呀，忸怩作态呀，这种事情从未挨近过这颗心。据说有钱的乞丐收容所所长瓦勒诺先生曾经追过她，但没有成功，这曾使她的品德大放异采，因为这位瓦勒诺先生，年轻高大，孔武有力，满面红光，蓄着一把又浓又黑的连腮胡，是外省人称为美男子的那种粗鲁、放肆、说起话来乱嚷嚷的人。 </div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Madame de Renal, being extremely shy and liable to be swayed by her moods, was offended chiefly by the restless movements and loud voice of M. Valenod. The distaste that she felt for what at Verrieres goes by the name of gaiety had won her the reputation of being extremely proud of her birth. She never gave it a thought, but had been greatly pleased to see the inhabitants of Verrieres come less frequently to her house. We shall not attempt to conceal the fact that she was reckoned a fool in the eyes of their ladies, because, without any regard for her husband's interests, she let slip the most promising opportunities of procuring fine hats from Paris or Besancon. Provided that she was left alone to stroll in her fine garden, she never made any complaint.</div>
  <div class="right">德·莱纳夫人很害羞，性情看上去很是平和，特别讨厌瓦勒诺先生不住地动和他的大嗓门。她远离维里埃人所谓的快乐，这使人认为她对自己的出身感到非常骄傲。她倒也不在意，看到本城男性居民越来越少登她家的门，反而感到很高兴。我们无须隐瞒，她在那些人的太太们眼中是个傻瓜，因为她在丈夫身上竟然一点儿心计也不用，白白放过一些让人从巴黎或贝藏松为自己买来漂亮帽子的好机会。只要大家能让她一个人在自家美丽的花园中随意走走，她也就心满意足了。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She was a simple soul, who had never risen even to the point of criticising her husband, and admitting that he bored her. She supposed,without telling herself so, that between husband and wife there could be no more tender relations. She was especially fond of M. de Renal when he spoke to her of his plans for their children, one of whom he intended to place in the army, the second on the bench, and the third in the church. In short, she found M. de Renal a great deal less boring than any of the other men of her acquaintance.</div>
  <div class="right">她是一个天真幼稚的女人，从未想到对丈夫品头评足，也从未承认丈夫使她感到厌烦。她猜想，当然未曾向自己说破，夫妻之间不过如此罢了，不会有更亲密的关系。当德·莱纳先生跟她谈论他对孩子的打算时，她倒是爱他的；他想让老大进军队，老二进法院，老三进教会。总之，和她认识的那些男人相比，她觉得德·莱纳先生算是最不讨厌的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This wifely opinion was justified. The Mayor of Verrieres owed his reputation for wit, and better still for good tone, to half a dozen pleasantries which he had inherited from an uncle. This old Captain  de Renal had served before the Revolution in the Duke of Orleans's regiment of infantry, and, when he went to Paris, had had the right of entry into that Prince's drawing-rooms. He had there seen Madame de Montesson, the famous Madame de Genlis, M. Ducrest, the 'inventor' of the Palais Royal.These personages figured all too frequently in M. de Renal's stories. But by degrees these memories of things that it required so much delicacy to relate had become a burden to him, and for some time now it was only on solemn occasions that he would repeat his anecdotes of the House of Orleans. As he was in other respects most refined, except when the talk ran on money, he was regarded, and rightly, as the most aristocratic personage in Verrieres.</div>
  <div class="right">妻子对丈夫的这种评价倒也合情合理。维里埃的市长被认为是—个风趣、高雅的人，这名声全靠他从一位叔父那里学来的那五、六个笑话。老上尉德·莱纳革命前在奥尔良公爵的步兵团里效力，他去巴黎的时候有幸进入亲王的客厅。他在那里见过德·泰莱松夫人，著名的德·让利夫人，王宫里的发明家杜卡莱先生。这些人物经常出现在德·莱纳先生的故事里。不过，回忆这种讲起来极微妙的事情渐渐成了他的一项工作，所以，近来他只在重大场合才重复这些与奥尔良家族有关的奇闻轶事。再说，只要不谈钱，他的确是彬彬有礼的，所以，他有理由被看作是维里埃最有贵族气派的人物。</div></div>
