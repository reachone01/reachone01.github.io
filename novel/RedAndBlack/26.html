<p>I  am alone on earth, no one deigns to think of me. All the people I see making  their fortunes have a brazenness and a hard-heartedness which I do not sense in  myself. Ah! I shall soon be dead, either of hunger, or from the sorrow of  finding men so hard.</p>
<p>YOUNG</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>我孤零零一个人活在世上，没有一个人肯想到我。所有那些我亲眼看见发迹的人，都是厚颜无耻和心肠冷酷的，而我却完全不一样。他们因为我心地过分善良而恨我。啊！不久以后我就要死了，或者是由于饥饿，或者是由于看到这些如此冷酷的人而感到的不幸。</p>

  <div class="left"><p>He  made haste to brush his coat and to go downstairs; he was late. An under-master  rebuked him severely; instead of seeking to excuse himself, Julien crossed his  arms on his breast:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他急忙刷衣服，下楼，还是迟到了。一位学监严厉地责备他。于连并未设法为自己辩解，反而把胳膊往胸前一叉：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Peccavi,  pater optime (I have sinned, I confess my fault, O Father),' he said with a  contrite air.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“Peccavi，pateroptime（我的神甫啊，我犯了罪，我认错）。”他面带懊悔的神情说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  was a most successful beginning. The sharp wits among the seminarists saw that  they had to deal with a man who was not new to the game. The recreation hour  came, Julien saw himself the object of general curiosity. But they found in him  merely reserve and silence. Following the maxims that he had laid down for  himself, he regarded his three hundred and twenty-one comrades as so many  enemies; the most dangerous of all in his eyes was the abbe Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个开端大获成功。学生中的那些精明人一眼便看出，他们要与之打交道的人可不是个初入道的新手。休息的时候，于连看见自己成为众  人好奇的对象。然而他们从他那里得到的只是克制与沉默。根据他给自己定下的格言，他把他的三百二十一个同学都看作敌人，在他眼中，最危险的敌人乃是彼拉神甫。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  few days later, Julien had to choose a confessor, he was furnished with a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>几天后，于连要选择忏悔神甫了，人家给了他一份名单。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Eh;  Great God, for what do they take me?' he said to himself. 'Do they suppose I  can't take a hint?' And he chose the abbe Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“嘿！仁慈的天主！他们把我当成什么人了，”他心里说，“他们以为我不明白开口意味着什么吗？”他选择了彼拉神甫。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Though  he did not suspect it, this step was decisive. A little seminarist, still quite  a boy, and a native of Verrieres, who, from the first day, had declared himself  his friend, informed him that if he had chosen M.Castanede, the vice-principal  of the Seminary, he would perhaps have shown greater prudence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他没有料到，这竟是决定性的一步。神学院有一个小修士，年纪很轻，维里埃人，第一天就说是他的朋友，告诉他假如选副院长卡斯塔奈  德先生，也许是更为谨慎的行动。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  abbe Castanede is the enemy of M. Pirard, who is suspected of Jansenism'; the  little seminarist added, whispering this information in his ear.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“卡斯塔奈佛神甫是彼拉先主的敌人，人家怀疑彼拉先生是詹森派，”小修士俯在他耳畔补充说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>All  the first steps taken by our hero who fancied himself so prudent were, like his  choice of a confessor, foolish in the extreme. Led astray by all the  presumption of an imaginative man, he mistook his intentions for facts, and  thought himself a consummate hypocrite. His folly went the length of his  reproaching himself for his successes in this art of the weak.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>我们的主人公自以为谨慎，可是他开始时走的那几步，例如选择忏悔神甫，全都是鲁莽之举。富于想象的人所特有的自负将他引入歧途，  他把意图当成事实，还自以为是个老练的伪君子呢。他真是疯了，居然自责使用了以柔克刚之术片取得了成功。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Alas!  It is my sole weapon! In another epoch, it would have been by speaking actions  in the face of the enemy that I should have earned my bread.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“唉！这是我唯一的武器！换一个时代，”他对自已说，“我会面对敌人用有力的行动来挣我的面包。”</p>

<p>Julien,  satisfied with his own conduct, looked around him; he found everywhere an  appearance of the purest virtue.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连对自己的行为很满意，环顾左右，发现到处都是最纯洁的美德的表象。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Nine  or ten of the seminarists lived in the odour of sanctity, and had visions like  Saint Teresa and Saint Francis, when he received the Stigmata upon Monte Verna,  in the Apennines. But this was a great secret which their friends kept to  themselves. These poor young visionaries were almost always in the infirmary.  Some hundred others combined with a robust faith an unwearying application.  They worked until they made themselves ill, but without learning much. Two or  three distinguished themselves by real talent, and, among these, one named  Chazel; but Julien felt himself repelled by them, and they by him.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>八到十个修士生活在圣洁的气氛中，都像圣女德肋撒和在亚子宁山脉的维尔纳山顶上受五伤时的圣方济各一样，见过幻象。不过这是一大  秘密，他们的朋友绝口不谈。这几位见过幻象的年轻人几乎总是呆在医务室里：其他一百来位将顽强的信仰和不倦的勤奋结合起来。他们用功到了病倒的程度，不过所获无多。两三位真有才能者脱颖而出，其中有一位叫夏泽尔，不过于连觉得他们讨厌，他们也觉得于连讨厌。</p>
</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The rest of  the three hundred and twenty-one seminarists were composed entirely of coarse  creatures who were by no means certain that they understood the Latin words  which they repeated all day long. Almost all of them were the sons of peasants,  and preferred to earn their bread by reciting a few Latin words rather than by  tilling the soil. It was after making this discovery, in the first few days, that  Julien promised himself a rapid success. 'In every service, there is need of  intelligent people, for after all there is work to be done,' he told himself.  'Under Napoleon, I should have been a serjeant; among these future cures, I  shall be a Vicar-General.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>三百二十一个修士中剩下的就都是些粗俗之辈了，他们也拿不准是不是懂了那些整天背来背去的拉丁词。他们几乎都是农家子弟，宁肯靠背拉丁文挣面包而不愿意在土圪垃里刨食吃。根据这一观察，于连从最初几天起就发誓迅速取得成功。“在任何事业中，都需要聪明人，因为总是有事情要做，”他想，“在拿破仑治下，我可能当个副官；而在这些未来的本堂神甫中，我则要当代理主教。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'All  these poor devils,' he added, 'labourers from the cradle, have lived, until  they came here, upon skim milk and black bread. In their cottages, they tasted  meat only five or six times in a year. Like the Roman soldiers who found active  service a holiday, these boorish peasants are enchanted by the luxuries of the  Seminary.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“所有这些可怜虫，”他继续想，“从小就干粗活，他们在来到这里之前，吃的是黑面包，啃的是有凝块的牛奶，住的是茅草屋，一年只能吃五、六回肉。像那些古罗马的士兵，把打仗当休息，这些粗俗的农民对神学院的好饭菜高兴得不得了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  never read anything in their lack-lustre eyes beyond the satisfaction of a  bodily need after dinner, and the expectation of a bodily pleasure before the  meal. Such were the people among whom he must distinguish himself; but what  Julien did not know, what they refrained from telling him, was that to be at  the top of the various classes of dogma, church history, etc., etc., which were  studied in the Seminary, was nothing more in their eyes than a sin of vain  glory. Since Voltaire, since Two Chamber government, which is at bottom only  distrust and private judgment, and instils in the hearts of the people that  fatal habit of want of confidence, the Church of France seems to have realised  that books are its true enemies. It is heartfelt submission that is everything  in its eyes. Success in studies, even in sacred studies, is suspect, and with  good reason. What is to prevent the superior man from going over to the other  side, like Sieyes or Gregoire? The trembling Church clings to the Pope as to  her sole chance of salvation. The Pope alone can attempt to paralyse private  judgment, and, by the pious pomps of the ceremonies of his court, make an  impression upon the sick and listless minds of men and women of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>从他们暗淡的眼睛里，于连只看到饭后被满足的肉体需要和饭前焦急难耐的肉体快乐。他就是应该在这样一些人中间脱颖而出，然而于连不知道，他们也不肯告诉他，在神学院学习教理、圣教史等不同课程，如果取得第一名，在他们看来不过是一桩辉煌的罪孽罢了。自打有了伏尔泰，自打实行两院制政府，说到底那不过是怀疑和个人研究，给民众的思想带来自疑这种坏习惯，法国教会好像懂得了书籍乃是它的真正敌人。在它看来，心灵的服从就是一切。在学习、甚至圣洁的学习中取得成功，更认为是可疑的，而且也并非没有充分的理由。谁能阻止西埃耶斯或者格雷古瓦那等杰出的人投奔另一方！教会心惊胆战，就去依附教皇，仿佛那是获救—的唯一机会。唯有教皇还能试一试去瓦解个人研究，用教廷里那些仪式的虔诚盛大来影响上流人士的厌倦病态的精神。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Having  half mastered these several truths, which however all the words uttered in a  Seminary tend to deny, Julien fell into a deep melancholy. He worked hard, and  rapidly succeeded in learning things of great value to a priest, entirely false  in his eyes, and in which he took no interest. He imagined that there was  nothing else for him to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种种事实，于连看得半明半暗，而在神学院里说出来的话又都力图使之成为谎言，他陷入深深的忧郁之中。他很用功，很快学到一些对一个教士很有用但他看来很虚假的东西，他颇不感兴趣。他认为也没有别的事情可做。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Am  I then forgotten by all the world?' he wondered. He little knew that M. Pirard  had received and had flung in the fire several letters bearing the Dijon  postmark, letters in which, despite the most conventional style and language,  the most intense passion was apparent. Keen remorse seemed to be doing battle  with this love. 'So much the better,' thought the abbe Pirard, 'at least it is  not an irreligious woman that this young man has loved.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“难道全世界的人都把我忘了？”他常想。他不知道彼拉神甫收到但烧掉过几封盖有第戎邮戳的信，信的用词最为得体，但却透出最为强烈的激情。巨大的悔恨似乎在遏制他们的爱情。“这样更好”，彼拉神甫想，“至少这年轻人爱的不是一个不信宗教的女人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  day, the abbe Pirard opened a letter which seemed to be half obliterated by  tears, it was an eternal farewell. 'At last,' the writer informed Julien,  'heaven has granted me the grace of hating not the author of my fault, he will  always be dearer to me than anything in the world, but my fault itself. The  sacrifice is made, my friend. It is not without tears, as you see. The  salvation of the beings to whom I am bound, and whom you have loved so dearly,  has prevailed. A just but terrible God can no longer wreak vengeance upon them  for their mother's crimes. Farewell, Julien, be just towards men.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天，彼拉神甫拆开一封信，有一半已被泪水浸得字迹模糊，那是一封诀别的信。“终于，”信上对于连说，“上天给我恩典，让我恨，不是恨铸成我的错误的人，他将永远是我在世上最爱的人，而是恨我的错误本身。牺牲已经做出，我的朋友。  并非没有眼泪，您看到了。我应该为之献身、您也曾那样地爱过的那些人，他们的获救最为要紧。一个公正然而可怕的天主不会因他们的母亲犯了罪而对他们施行报复了。永别了，于连，公正地待人吧。”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  ending to the letter was almost entirely illegible. The writer gave an address  at Dijon, and at the same time hoped that Julien would never reply, or that at  least he would confine himself to language which a woman restored to the ways  of virtue could read without blushing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>信的这个未尾几乎完全看不清楚。信上给了一个在第戎的地址，但希望于连永远不回信或至少不要说出让一个幡然悔悟的女人听了脸红的话。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  melancholy, assisted by the indifferent food supplied to the Seminary by the  contractor for dinners at 83 centimes a head, was beginning to have an effect  on his health, when one morning Fouque suddenly appeared in his room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>忧郁，加上承办八十三个生丁一顿的午餐的人供应给神学院的低劣饭菜，已经开始影响到于连的健康。一天早晨，富凯突然出现在他的房间里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'At  last I have found my way in. I have come five times to Besancon, honour bound,  to see you. Always a barred door. I posted someone at the gate of the Seminary;  why the devil do you never come out?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我总算进来了。为了看你，我已经来过贝藏松五次，这不怪你。总是碰钉子。我派了一个人守在神学院门口，见鬼，你怎么总是不出来？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is a test which I have set myself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是我强加给自己的一个考验。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  find you greatly altered. At last I see you again. Two good five franc pieces  have just taught me that I was no better than a fool not to have offered them  on my first visit.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我发现你变多了。我总算又见到了你。两个像五法郎的漂漂亮亮的埃居刚刚让我知道我是个傻瓜，没有第一次来的时候就拿出来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  conversation between the friends was endless. Julien changed colour when Fouque  said to him:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>两个朋友的话总也说不完，于连的脸色陡然一变，因为富凯说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Have  you heard, by the way? The mother of your pupils has become most devoutly religious.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“顺便问一句，你知道吗？你的学生的母亲现在可虔诚啦。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  he spoke with that detached air which makes so singular an impression on the  passionate soul whose dearest interests the speaker unconsciously destroys.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他说这话时神情轻快随便，但是这种神情却在一颗充满激情的心灵上留下奇特的印象，因为说者无意中搅动了听者最珍贵的隐衷。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  my friend, the most exalted strain of piety. They say that she makes  pilgrimages. But, to the eternal shame of the abbe Maslon, who has been spying  so long upon that poor M. Chelan, Madame de Renal will have nothing to do with  him. She goes to confession at Dijon or Besancon.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，我的朋友，最狂热的虔诚。有人说她去朝圣呢。但是，那个监视了谢朗先生那么久的马斯隆神甫可丢脸了，德·莱纳夫人不愿意  向他忏悔。她到第戎或贝藏松做忏悔。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She  comes to Besancon!' said Julien, his brow flushing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她来贝藏松，”于连说，额上泛起了红晕。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Quite  often,' replied Fouque with a questioning air.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“经常来，”富凯不解地答道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Have  you any Constitutionnels on you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你身上有《立宪党人报》吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What's  that you say?' replied Fouque.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你说什么？”富凯问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  ask you if you have any Constitutionnels?' Julien repeated, in a calmer tone. 'They are sold here for thirty sous a  copy.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我问你有没有《立宪党人报》？”于连以最平静的口吻又问。“在这儿买要三十个苏一份呢。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  Liberals even in the Seminary!' cried Fouque. 'Unhappy France!' he went on,  copying the hypocritical tone and meek accents of the abbe Maslon.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么！神学院里也有自由党！”富凯叫道。“可怜的法兰西！”他学着马斯隆神甫那伪善的声音和甜密的腔调，补了一句。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  visit would have made a profound impression upon our hero, had not, the very  next day, a remark addressed to him by that little seminarist from Verrieres  who seemed such a boy, led him to make an important discovery. Ever since he  had been in the Seminary, Julien's conduct had been nothing but a succession of  false steps. He laughed bitterly at himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>幸亏入院第二天，于连认为还是个孩子的那位小修士曾经跟他说了一句话，让他有了一个重大的发现，不然的话，这次来访可就要给我们  的主人公留下深刻的印象了，自进入神学院以来，于连的行为不过是一连串的做假罢了。他时常痛苦地自嘲。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  a matter of fact, the important actions of his life were wisely ordered; but he  paid no attention to details, and the clever people in a Seminary look only at  details. And so he passed already among his fellow students as a free thinker.  He had been betrayed by any number of trifling actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>其实，他一生中的那些重大行动都实施得很巧妙，但他不注意细节，而神学院里那些精明人却只盯着细节。因此，他已在同学中被认作自由思想者了。一大堆琐细的行动出卖了他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  their eyes he was convicted of this appalling vice, he thought, he judged for  himself, instead of blindly following authority and example. The abbe Pirard  had been of no assistance to him; he had not once uttered a word to him apart  from the tribunal of penitence, and even there he listened rather than spoke.  It would have been very different had Julien chosen the abbe Castanede.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在他们看来，他肯定已经犯下这桩滔天大罪，他思想，他独立判断，而不是盲目地跟随权威和循例办事。彼拉神甫丝毫帮不了他；他在告罪亭之外没有跟他说过话，就是在告罪亭里也是听得多，说得少。如果他选了卡斯塔奈德神甫，情况就会大不一样。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  moment that Julien became aware of his own folly, his interest revived. He  wished to know the whole extent of the harm, and, with this object, emerged a  little from that haughty and obstinate silence with which he repulsed his  fellows. It was then that they took their revenge on him. His advances were  received with a contempt which went the length of derision. He realised that  since his entering the Seminary, not an hour had passed, especially during  recreation, that had not borne some consequence for or against him, had not  increased the number of his enemies, or won him the good will of some  seminarist who was genuinely virtuous or a trifle less boorish than the rest.  The damage to be repaired was immense, the task one of great difficulty.  Thenceforward Julien's attention was constantly on the alert; it was a case of  portraying himself in an entirely new character.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连察到干了一件傻事，也就不在烦闷了。他想知到损失究竟有多大，为此，他略微打破了那种用以拒斥同学们的高傲而固执的沉默。于是他们开始报复了。他的趋奉遇到了近乎嘲弄的轻蔑。他这才知道，自打他进入神学院，没有一个钟头，尤其是休息的时候，不曾产生对他或不利的后果，不曾增加他的敌人的数目或者为他赢得几位真正有德或稍许不那么粗俗的修士的好感。需要弥补的损失很大，任务很艰巨。从此，于连的警惕就处于常备不懈的状态，他要为自己勾画出一种全新的性格来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  control of his eyes, for instance, gave him a great deal of trouble. It is not  without reason that in such places they are kept lowered. 'What was not my  presumption at Verrieres!' Julien said to himself, 'I imagined I was alive; I  was only preparing myself for life; here I am at last in the world, as I shall  find it until I have played out my part, surrounded by real enemies. What an  immense difficulty,' he went on, 'is this incessant hypocrisy! It would put the  labours of Hercules to shame. The Hercules of modern times is Sixtus V, who for  fifteen years on end, by his modesty, deceived forty Cardinals, who had seen  him proud and vigorous in his youth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>比方说，他的眼睛的表情就给他带来不少麻烦。在这种地方人们都垂下眼睛，这并非没有道理。“我在维里埃时是多么自负啊！”于连想，“我自以为是在生活；其实那不过是为生活做准备罢了，如今我终于进入这个世界，我将发现直到我演完我的角色，我的周围永远布满了真正的敌人。每一分钟都要虚伪，”他继续想，“这有多难啊；这是要让赫拉克利斯的功绩黯然失色啊。现代的赫拉克利斯就是西克斯特五世，他用谦逊的态度骗了四十个红衣主教整整十五年，他们曾经看见过他年轻时的暴躁和高傲。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  learning is really nothing here!' he told himself with scorn;' progress in  dogma, in sacred history, and the rest of it, count only in appearance. All  that is said on that topic is intended to make fools like myself fall into the  trap. Alas, my sole merit consisted in my rapid progress, in my faculty for  grasping all that nonsense. Can it be that in their hearts they esteem it at  its true value; judge of it as I do? And I was fool enough to be proud of  myself! Those first places in class which I always obtain have served only to  give me bitter enemies. Chazel, who knows far more than I, always puts into his  compositions some piece of stupidity which sends him down to the fiftieth  place; if he obtains the first, it is when he is not thinking. Ah! one word, a  single word from M. Pirard, how useful it would have been to me!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这么说，学问在这儿什么也不是啦，”他愤愤地自语道，“在教理、圣敦史等功课上取得进步只是表面上算数。在这方面他们说的那些话不过是让我这样的傻瓜落入陷阱。唉，我唯一的长处是进步快，善于理解那些空话。是不是他们在内心深处也知道这些空话的真正价值？也和我有一样的看法？我真傻，居然还以此为骄傲：我老是得第一！这只能为我招来许多不共戴天的敌人。夏泽尔比我聪明，他总是在作文中说几句蠢话，使自己降到第五十几名；如果他得了第一名，那是出于疏忽。啊，彼拉先生的一句话，仅仅一句，对我该是多么有用啊。”</p>

<p>From  the moment in which Julien's eyes were opened, the long exercises of ascetic  piety, such as the Rosary five times weekly, the hymns to the Sacred Heart,  etc., etc., which had seemed to him of such deadly dullness, became the most  interesting actions of his life. Sternly criticising his own conduct, and  seeking above all not to exaggerate his methods, Julien did not aspire from the  first, like the seminarists who served as models to the rest, to perform at  every moment some significant action, that is to say one which gave proof of  some form of Christian perfection. In Seminaries, there is a way of eating a  boiled egg which reveals the progress one has made in the godly life.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连大彻大悟以后，先前厌烦得要命的那些长时间的苦行修练，如每周数五次念珠、在圣心教堂唱圣歌，等等，等等，如今都变成最有兴味的行动时刻。于连严格地审视自己，特别是力争不夸大自己的能力，他不想学那些为他人作榜样的修士那样，一上来就时刻做出有意义的行动，也就是说证明某种基督教的完善。在神学院，有一种吃带壳溏心蛋的方式，更表明在宗教生活中取得的进步。</p>

<p>Julien  sought at first to arrive at the non culpa, to wit, the state of the young  seminarist whose gait, his way of moving his arms, eyes, etc., do not, it is  true, indicate anything worldly, but do not yet show the creature absorbed by  the idea of the next life and the absolute nullity of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连首先试图做到无罪，这是年轻修士的一种状态，其走路的姿态、手臂和眼睛的动法等等实际上已无任何世俗气，但尚未表明他已全神  贯注于来世的观念和今世的纯粹虚无。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Everywhere  Julien found inscribed in charcoal, on the walls of the passages, sentences  like the following: 'What are sixty years of trial, set in the balance with an  eternity of bliss or an eternity of boiling oil in hell!'He  no longer despised them; he realised that he must have them always before his  eyes. 'What shall I be doing all my life?' he said to himself; 'I shall be  selling the faithful a place in heaven. How is that place to be made visible to  them? By the difference between my exterior and that of a layman.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连不断地在走廊的墙上发现一些用炭书写的词句，例如：“与永恒的快乐或地狱里永恒的沸油相比，六十年的考验算什么？”他不再蔑视这些句子了，他明白应该不断地将其置于目前。“我这一生要干什么呢？”他想，“我将向信徒们出售天堂里的位子。这位子如何能让他们看见呢？通过我的外表和—个俗人的外表之间的区别。”</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  several months of application kept up at every moment, Julien still had the air  of a thinker. His way of moving his eyes and opening his lips did not reveal an  implicit faith ready to believe everything and to uphold everything, even by  martyrdom. It was with anger that Julien saw himself surpassed in this respect  by the most boorish peasants. They had good reasons for not having the air of  thinkers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过数月不间断的努力，于连仍是一副思考的样子。他转睛动嘴的方式仍未表明随时准备相信一切、支持一切、甚至证之以殉道者的那种内在的信仰。于连看到在这方面那些最粗俗的农民胜过了他，感到愤愤不平。他们没有思考的样子，那是有充分的理由的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>What  pains did he not take to arrive at that expression of blind and fervent faith,  which is so frequently to be found in the convents of Italy, and such perfect  examples of which Guercino has bequeathed to us laymen in his paintings in  churches.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>那种流露出一种随时准备相信一切容忍一切的狂热而盲目的信仰的面容，我们经常可以在意大利的修道院里看到，奎尔契诺已通过他的教堂画为我们这些俗人留下了先美的典型，为了有这样一张脸，于连什么样的努力不曾做呢？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the greatest festivals the seminarists were given sausages with pickled  cabbage. Julien's neighbours at table observed that he remained unmoved by this  good fortune; it was one of his first crimes. His comrades saw in it an odious  mark of the most stupid hypocrisy; nothing made him so many enemies. 'Look at  that gentleman, look at that proud fellow,' they would say, 'pretending to  despise our best ration, sausages with cabbage! The wretched conceit of the  damned fellow!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在重大的节日里，修士们可以吃到红肠配酸白菜。于连的邻座注意到他对这种幸福无动于衷；这是他的最主要的罪行之一。他的同学们从中看到了最愚蠢的虚伪的一个丑恶的特征，再没有比这给他招来更多的敌人了。“看这个资产者，看这个倨傲的家伙，”他们说，“他假装鄙视最好的伙食，红肠配酸白菜！呸，无赖！骄傲的家伙！该下地狱的！”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p> He should have refrained as an act of penance from eating the  whole of his portion, and should have made the sacrifice of saying to some  friend, with reference to the pickled cabbage: 'What is there that man can  offer to an All Powerful Being, if it be not voluntary suffering?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



</div></div>
<div class="layout">

<p>Julien  lacked the experience which makes it so easy for us to see things of this sort.</p>

<p>'Alas!  The ignorance of these young peasants, my comrades, is a great advantage to  them,' Julien would exclaim in moments of discouragement. 'When they arrive in  the Seminary, the teacher has not to rid them of the appalling number of worldly  thoughts which I brought with me, and which they read on my face, do what I  will.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“唉！这些年轻的农民，我的同学，对他们来说，无知乃是一种巨大的优点，”于连在泄气的时候大叫，“他们到了神学院，并没有世俗的思想需要老师加以纠正，而我带进神学院的世俗思想却多得可怕，无论怎么做，他们总能从我的脸上看出来。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  studied with an attention that bordered upon envy the more boorish of the young  peasants who arrived at the Seminary. At the moment when they were stripped of  their ratteen jackets to be garbed in the black cassock, their education was  limited to an immense and unbounded respect for dry and liquid money, as the  saying goes in the Franche-Comte.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连以一种近乎嫉妒的专注研究那些进神学院的年轻乡下人中最粗俗的人。当他们扒去粗布上衣换上黑袍子时，他们的教育就仅限于无限地尊敬现钱，像弗朗什－孔奉人所说的那样，干爽流动的金钱。</p>

<p>It  is the sacramental and heroic fashion of expressing the sublime idea of ready  cash.</p>

<p>Happiness,  for these seminarists, as for the heroes of Voltaire's tales, consists first  and foremost in dining well. Julien discovered in almost all 4.For instance, in  the Louvre, no. 1130: 'Francis Duke of Aquitaine laying aside the crown and  putting on a monastic habit.' of them an innate respect for the man who wears a  coat of fine cloth. This sentiment estimates distributive justice, as it is  dealt out to us by our courts, at its true worth, indeed below its true worth.  'What is to be gained,' they would often say among themselves, 'by going to law  with the big?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

</div></div>

<p>这些神学院学生和伏尔泰小说中的主人公一样，他们的幸福首先在于吃得好。于连发现他们几乎人人都对穿细呢料衣服的人有一种天生的  敬意。有这种观念的人对公正分配，例如法庭给予我们的那种公正分配，进行恰如其分的估价，甚至低估其价值。他们私下里常说：“跟一个大块头打官司能有什么好儿呢？”</p>

<p>Not  to smile respectfully at the mere name of the Prefect is reckoned, among the  peasants of the Franche-Comte, an imprudence; and imprudence, among the poor,  is promptly punished with want of bread.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一提到省长的名字，就须报以含有敬意的微笑，否则，在弗朗什－孔奉的农民的眼里，就是一种轻率失礼，而轻率失礼在穷人那里很快就  会受到没有面包的惩罚。</p></div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  having been almost suffocated at first by his sense of scorn, Julien ended by  feeling pity: it had often been the lot of the fathers of the majority of his  comrades to come home on a winter evening to their cottages, and to find there  no bread, no chestnuts, and no potatoes. 'Is it surprising then,' Julien asked  himself, 'if the happy man, in their eyes, is first of all the man who has just  eaten a good dinner, and after that he who possesses a good coat! My comrades  have a definite vocation; that is to say, they see in the ecclesiastical  calling a long continuation of this happiness: dining well and having a warm  coat in winter.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>最初，于连因感到受人轻蔑而觉得喘不过气来，后来他却有了侧隐之心：他的大部分同学的父亲在冬天的晚上回到茅草屋里，常常是没有面包，没有栗子，也没有土豆。“在他们眼里，”于连想，“幸福的人首先是刚刚吃过一顿好饭的人，其次是一个有一件好衣服的人，这有什么可奇怪的呢？我的同学们有坚定的志向，这就是说，他们在教士这职业中看到了一种持续长久的幸福：吃得好，冬天有一件暖和的衣服。”</p>

<p>Julien  happened to hear a young seminarist, endowed with imagination, say to his  companion:</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'Why  should not I become Pope like Sixtus v, who was a swineherd?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我为什么不能像西克斯特五世那样当教皇呢？他也放过猪呀。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'They  make none but Italians Popes,' replied the friend; 'but they'll draw lots among  us, for sure, to fill places as Vicars-General and Canons, and perhaps Bishops.  M. P—— the Bishop of Chalons, is the son of a cooper; that is my father's  trade.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“只有意大利人才能当教皇，”那朋友说，“但是在我们中间肯定是靠抓阄来决定谁当代理主教、议事司铎、也许还有主教的。夏隆的主  教Ｐ……先生就是箍桶匠的儿子，正是我父亲干的那一行。”</p>

<p>One  day, in the middle of a lesson in dogma, the abbe Pirard sent for Julien. The  poor young fellow was delighted to escape from the physical and moral  atmosphere in which he was plunged.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>于连念道：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'Amanda  Binet, at the Giraffe cafe, before eight o'clock. Say you are from Genlis, and  a cousin of my mother.'</p>

<p>Julien  perceived the immensity of the danger; the abbe Castanede's police had stolen  the address from him.</p>

<p>'The  day on which I came here,' he replied, gazing at the abbe Pirard's forehead,  for he could not face his terrible eye, 'I was trembling with fear:M.  Chelan had told me that this was a place full of tale-bearing and spite of all  sorts; spying and the accusation of one's comrades are encouraged here. Such is  the will of heaven, to show life as it is to young priests, and to inspire in  them a disgust with the world and its pomps.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我来这儿的那天，”他答道，只看着彼拉神甫的额头，因为他受不了他那可怕的目光，“我心惊胆战，谢朗神甫曾对我说这是一个充满  了告密和各种坏事的地方；同学之间的侦察和揭发受到鼓励。上天也正愿如此，以合便向年轻的教士们展示生活就是这般模样，激起他们对尘世及其浮华的厌恶。”</p>

<p>'On  the day of my coming to Besancon, about noon, I felt hungry, I went into a  cafe. My heart was filled with repugnance for so profane a spot; but I thought  that my luncheon would cost me less there than at an inn. A lady, who seemed to  be the mistress of the place, took pity on my raw looks. &quot;Besancon is full  of wicked people,&quot; she told me, &quot;I am afraid for you, Sir. If you  find yourself in any trouble, come to me, send a message to me before eight  o'clock. If the porters at the Seminary refuse to take your message, say that  you are my cousin, and come from Genlis…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那天我到了贝藏松，将近中午，我饿了，就进了一家咖啡馆。我心里充满了对这种世俗地方的厌恶，可是我想在那儿吃饭要比在旅馆便  宜。一位太太，看上去是铺子的老板，见我初来乍到的样子，就动了怜悯之心。她对我说：‘我很为您担心，先生，贝藏松净是坏人。如果您碰上什么倒霉的事，就来找我吧，八点之前打发人到我这儿来。如果神学院的看门人不肯替您跑腿，您就说您是我的表亲，从让利来……’”</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>'All  this farrago will have to be investigated,' exclaimed the abbe Pirard who,  unable to remain in one place, was striding up and down the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您这番花言巧语是要核实的，”彼拉神甫嚷道，他已坐不住了，在房间里走来走去。</p>

<p>The  abbe accompanied Julien and locked him in. He himself at once proceeded to  examine his trunk, in the bottom of which the fatal card had been carefully  concealed. Nothing was missing from the trunk, but several things had been  disarranged; and yet the key never left his possession. 'How fortunate,' Julien  said to himself, 'that during the time of my blindness I never made use of the  permission to leave the building, which M. Castanede so frequently offered me  with a generosity which I now understand. Perhaps I might have been so foolish  as to change my clothes and pay the fair Amanda a visit, I should have been  ruined.When  they despaired of making any use of their information in that way, so as not to  waste it they have used it to denounce me.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>神甫跟着于连，把他锁在屋里。于连立刻检查箱子，那张要命的纸牌就是极细心地藏在箱底的。箱子里什么也不少，但有几处动了；不过  他的钥匙可是从不离身的。“多么幸运，”于连想，“在我还是两眼一摸黑的那段时间里，卡斯塔奈德神甫常常好心地准我外出，我从未接受，现在我明白这好心是什么了。要是我抵挡不住诱惑，换了衣服去会美丽的阿芒达，我可就完了。他们未能用这种办法从所获情报中得到好处，为了不浪费这份情报，就拿它做了揭发材料了。”</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>A  couple of hours later, the Director sent for him.</p>

<p>'You  have not lied,' he said to him, looking at him less severely; 'but to keep such  an address is an imprudence the serious nature of which you cannot conceive.  Unhappy boy! In ten years, perhaps, it will redound to your hurt.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您没有撒谎，”院长对他说，目光不那么严厉了，“不过，保留这样的地址是不谨慎的，其严重性您还想象不出。不幸的孩子！也许十  年以后，它会给您带来损害。”
