<p>The  republic—for every person today willing to sacrifice all to the common good,  there are thousands and millions who know only their own pleasures and their  vanity. One is esteemed in Paris for one's carriage, not for one's virtue.</p>
<p>NAPOLEON, Memorial</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>共和國－在今天，有一個願意為公益犧牲一切的人，就有好幾千、好幾百萬只知有自己享樂，自己虛榮的人。在巴黎，一個人是因為他的馬車而不是因為他的德行受到尊敬。</p>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>The  footman burst in, announcing: 'Monsieur le Duc de ——.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>仆人急匆匆进来，通报：“德·某某公爵先生。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Hold  your tongue, you fool,' said the Duke as he entered the room. He said this so  well, and with such majesty that Julien could not help thinking that knowing  how to lose his temper with a footman was the whole extent of this great  personage's knowledge. Julien raised his eyes and at once lowered them again.  He had so clearly divined the importance of this new arrival that he trembled  lest his glance should be thought an indiscretion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“住嘴，您这个傻瓜，”公爵说，一边走了进来。他这句话说得那么好，那么威风凛凛，于连不由得想到，知道如何对仆人发脾气乃是这位大人物的全部本领。于连抬起眼睛，随即又垂下了。他猜出了新来的人的重要性，担心盯着他看是不谨慎的举动。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  Duke was a man of fifty, dressed like a dandy, and treading as though on  springs. He had a narrow head with a large nose, and a curved face which he  kept thrusting forward. It would have been hard for anyone to appear at once so  noble and so insignificant. His coming was a signal for the opening of the  discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这位公爵五十岁年纪，穿戴如浪荡子，走起来一蹦一蹦地。他的脑袋狭长，鼻子很大，面呈钩状，向前突出。要比他的神情更高贵、更空洞，也难。他一到，会议就开始。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was sharply interrupted in his physiognomical studies by the voice of M. de La  Mole. 'Let me present to you M. l'abbe Sorel,' said the Marquis. 'He is endowed  with an astonishing memory; it was only an hour ago that I spoke to him of the  mission with which he might perhaps be honoured, and, in order to furnish us  with a proof of his memory, he has learned by heart the first page of the  Quotidienne.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔先生的声音猛地打断了于连对于相貌的观察。“我向诸位介绍索莱尔神甫先生，”侯爵说，“他的记忆力惊人，一个钟头之前我才跟他谈到他有幸担负的使命，为了证明他的记忆力，他背出了《每日新闻》的第一版。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  The foreign news, from poor N ——,' said the master of the house. He picked up  the paper eagerly and, looking at Julien with a whimsical air, in the effort to  appear important: 'Begin, Sir,' he said to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！那位可怜的Ｎ……的国际新闻，”房主人说。他急忙拿起报纸，表情滑稽地看着于连，竭力显示自己很重要：“背吧，先生，”他说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  silence was profound, every eye was fixed on Julien; he repeated his lesson so  well that after twenty lines: 'That will do,' said the Duke.The  little man with the boar's eyes sat down. He was the chairman for, as soon as  he had taken his place, he indicated a card table to Julien, and made a sign to  him to bring it up to his side. Julien established himself there with writing  materials. He counted twelve people seated round the green cloth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一片寂静，所有的眼睛都盯着于连；他背得滚瓜烂熟，背了二十行，“够了，”公爵说，那个目光如野猪样的小个子坐下了。他是主席，因为他刚落座，就指了指一张牌桌，示意于连把它搬到他身边。于连带着书写用具坐下了。他数了数，十二个人坐在绿台布周围。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'M.  Sorel,' said the Duke, 'retire to the next room. We shall send for you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“索莱尔先生，”公爵说，“您到旁边的屋子里去，一会儿有人叫您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  master of the house assumed an uneasy expression. 'The shutters are not closed,'  he murmured to his neighbour. 'It is no use your looking out of the window,' he  foolishly exclaimed to Julien. 'Here I am thrust into a conspiracy at the very  least,' was the latter's thought. 'Fortunately, it is not one of the kind that  end on the Place de Greve. Even if there were danger, I owe that and more to  the Marquis. I should be fortunate, were it granted me to atone for all the  misery which my follies may one day cause him!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>房主人显得颇不安，“护窗板没有关上，”他稍稍压低声音对旁边的人说，又对于连愚蠢地喊道，“从窗口看也没有用。”于连想，“我至少是被卷进了一桩阴谋。幸好不是通向格莱沃广场的那种。如果有危险，我也应该去，为了侯爵就更应该去。如果我有机会弥补我那些疯狂之举将来会给他带来的烦恼，那该多好！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Without  ceasing to think of his follies and of his misery, he studied his surroundings  in such a way that he could never forget them. Only then did he remember that  he had not heard the Marquis tell his footman the name of the street, and the  Marquis had sent for a cab, a thing he never did.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他一边想着他那种种的疯狂和他的不幸，一边察看周围的环境，直看得牢记在心，永远不忘。直到这时，他才想起来，他根本没听见侯爵对仆人说街道的名字；侯爵乘了一辆封闭的马车，这在他是从未有过的。</p>

</div></div>

<p>Julien  was left for a long time to his reflections. He was in a parlour hung in green  velvet with broad stripes of gold. There was on the side table a large ivory  crucifix, and on the mantelpiece the book Du Pape, by M. de Maistre, with gilt  edges, and magnificently bound. Julien opened it so as not to appear to be  eavesdropping. Every now and then there was a sound of raised voices from the  next room. At length the door opened, his name was called.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连这样想啊想，想了好久。于连所在的客厅，墙上张着红色天鹅绒帷幔，饰有很宽的金线。靠墙的小桌上放着一个很大的象牙十字架，壁炉上摆着德·迈斯特先生的《论教皇》，切口涂金，装帧豪华。于连打开书，免得人家说他在听。隔壁房间里，说话的声音有时很高。终于，门开了，有人叫他。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Remember,  Gentlemen,' said the chairman, 'that from this moment we are addressing the Duc  de ——. This gentleman,' he said, pointing to Julien, 'is a young Levite,  devoted to our sacred cause, who will have no difficulty in repeating, thanks  to his astonishing memory, our most trivial words.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“请你们记住，先生们，”主席说，“从现在起，我们是在德·某某公爵先生面前说话。这位先生，”他指了指于连，“是一位年轻的教士，忠于我们的神圣事业，他有惊人的记忆力，可以很容易地把我们的发言的每一句话复述出来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monsieur  has the floor,' he said, indicating the personage with the fatherly air, who  was wearing three or four waistcoats. Julien felt that it would have been more  natural to call him the gentleman with the waist coats. He supplied himself  with paper and wrote copiously. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请先生发言，”他说，指了指态度慈祥、穿着三、四件背心的那个人。于连觉得直呼背心先生更来得自然。他摊开纸，写了很多。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p><span style="color:#930;">(Here  the author would have liked to insert a page of dots. 'That will not look  pretty,' says the publisher, 'and for so frivolous a work not to look pretty  means death.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>（这里作者原想放一页删节号，“那样未免不雅，”出版者说，“对一本如此浅薄的书来说，不雅就是死亡。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Politics,'  the author resumes, 'are a stone attached to the neck of literature, which, in  less than six months, drowns it. Politics in the middle of imaginative  interests are like a pistol-shot in the middle of a concert. The noise is  deafening without being emphatic. It is not in harmony with the sound of any of  the instruments. This mention of politics is going to give deadly offence to  half my readers, and to bore the other half, who have already found far more  interesting and emphatic politics in their morning paper.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
“政治，”作者回答，“是挂在文学脖子上的一块石头，不出六个月，就会让它沉下去。在妙趣横生的想象中有了政治，就好比音乐会中放了一枪。声音不大，却很刺耳。它和任何一种乐器的声音都不协调。这种政治必然会惹恼一半读者，并使另一半读者生厌，他们已经在早晨的报纸上读到了更专门、更有力的政治了……”
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  your characters do not talk politics,' the publisher retorts, 'they are no  longer Frenchmen of 1830, and your book ceases to hold a mirror, as you claim…  .')</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果您的人物不谈政治，”出版者又说，“那他们就不是一八三０年的法国人了，您的书也就不像您要求的那样是一面镜子了...）</span></p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  report amounted to twenty-six pages; the following is a quite colourless  extract; for I have been obliged, as usual, to suppress the absurdities, the  frequency of which would have appeared tedious or highly improbable. (Compare  the Gazette des Tribunaux. )</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的记录有二十六页，下面是一个大为减色的摘要，因为依例要删去可笑之处，太多了会显得讨厌或不大真实（参阅《法庭公报》）。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  man with the waistcoats and the fatherly air (he was a Bishop, perhaps), smiled  often, and then his eyes, between their tremulous lids, assumed a strange  brilliance and an expression less undecided than was his wont. This personage,  who was invited to speak first, before the Duke ('but what Duke?' Julien asked  himself), apparently to express opinions and to perform the functions of  Attorney General, appeared to Julien to fall into the uncertainty and absence  of definite conclusions with which those officers are often reproached. In the  course of the discussion the Duke went so far as to rebuke him for this.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>穿好几件背心、态度慈祥的那个人（可能是位主教）常微微一笑，于是他那包着晃晃当当的眼皮的眼睛就射出一种奇特的光，表情也比平时来得果断。这个人，人家让他第一个在公爵（“什么公爵呢？”于连心想。）面前发言，显然是要陈述各种观点，履行代理检察长的职责。于连觉得他游移不定，没有明确的结论，人们也常常这样指责那些法官们。讨论中，公爵甚至就此责备他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  several phrases of morality and indulgent philosophy, the man with the  waistcoats said:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一番道德和宽容哲学的说教之后，背心先生说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Noble  England, guided by a great man, the immortal Pitt, spent forty thousand million  francs in destroying the Revolution. If this assembly will permit me to express  somewhat boldly a melancholy reflection, England does not sufficiently  understand that with a man like Bonaparte, especially when one had had to  oppose to him only a collection of good intentions, there was nothing decisive  save personal measures … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“高贵的英国，在一个伟大人物、不朽的皮特的领导下，为了阻止革命，已经花费了四百亿法郎。请会议允许我稍许直率地谈谈一种令人不偷快的意见，英国不大懂得，对付波拿巴这样的人，尤其是当人们只靠一大堆良好愿望来反对他的时候，惟有个人手段才具有决定性……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  Praise of assassination again!' said the master of the house with an uneasy  air.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！又在赞美暗杀！”房主人不安地说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Spare  us your sentimental homilies,' exclaimed the chairman angrily; his boar's eye  gleamed with a savage light. 'Continue,' he said to the man with the  waistcoats. The chairman's cheeks and brow turned purple.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“饶了我们吧，您那一套感伤的说教，”主席生气地喊道，那对野猪眼射出了一道凶光。“说下去，”他对背心先生说。主席的腮帮和额头气得发紫。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Noble  England,' the speaker went on, 'is crushed today, for every Englishman, before  paying for his daily bread, is obliged to pay the interest on the forty  thousand million francs which were employed against the Jacobins. She has no  longer a Pitt … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“高贵的英国，”报告人接下去说，“如今已被拖垮，每个英国人在付面包钱之前，必须先支付用来对付雅各宾党人的那四百亿法郎的利息。它不再有皮特……”，</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She  has the Duke of Wellington,' said a military personage who assumed an air of  great importance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“它有威灵顿公爵，”一个军人说，摆出一副很了不起的样子。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Silence,  please, Gentlemen,' cried the chairman; 'if we continue to disagree, there will  have been no use in our sending for M. Sorel.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“求求你们，静一静，先生们，”主席高声说道，“如果我们还争论不休的话，让索莱尔先生进来，就是多余的了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'We  know that Monsieur is full of ideas,' said the Duke with an air of vexation and  a glance at the interrupter, one of Napoleon's Generals.Julien  saw that this was an allusion to something personal and highly offensive.  Everyone smiled; the turncoat General seemed beside himself with rage.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们知道先生有很多想法，”公爵恼了，一边说，一边望着插话者，从前拿破仑手下的一位将军。于连看出这句话影射一件极具侮辱性的个人隐私。大家都微微一笑，变节的将军看来要大发雷霆了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There  is no longer a Pitt,' the speaker went on, with the discouraged air of a man  who despairs of making his hearers listen to reason. 'Were there a fresh Pitt  in England, one does not hoodwink a nation twice by the same means… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不再有皮特了，先生们，”报告人又说，一副泄了气的样子，就像一个对于说服听众已然完全不抱希望的人。“即便在英国出现一个新的皮特，也不可能用同样的手段欺骗一个民族两次……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is why a conquering General, a Bonaparte is impossible now in France,' cried  the military interrupter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“所以，常胜将军，波拿巴，今后不可能再在法国出现了，”插话的那个军人叫道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  this occasion, neither the chairman nor the Duke dared show annoyance, though  Julien thought he could read in their eyes that they were tempted to do so.  They lowered their eyes, and the Duke contented himself with a sigh loud enough  to be audible to them all.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一次，主席和公爵都不敢发怒，尽管于连相信他从他们的眼睛里看出，他们很想发怒，他们都垂下眼睛，公爵只是叹了口气，声音响得让大家都听得见。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  the speaker had lost his temper.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>报告人倒是生气了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are in a hurry for me to conclude,' he said with heat, entirely discarding that  smiling politeness and measured speech which Julien had assumed to be the  natural expression of his character: 'you are in a hurry for me to conclude;  you give me no credit for the efforts that I am making not to offend the ears  of anyone present, however long they may be.Very  well, Gentlemen, I shall be brief.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有人急着要人赶快讲完，”他激动地说，把笑容可掬的礼貌和极有分寸的语言统统抛在一边，于连原来还以为那是他的性格表现呢。“有人急着要我赶快讲完，根本不考虑我作了多大努力不刺痛任何人的耳朵，不管有多么长。好吧，先生们，我讲得简短些。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  I shall say to you in the plainest of words: England has not a half penny left  for the service of the good cause. Were Pitt to return in person, with all his  genius he would not succeed in hoodwinking the small landowners of England, for  they know that the brief campaign of Waterloo cost them, by itself, one  thousand million francs. Since you wish for plain speaking,' the speaker added,  growing more and more animated, 'I shall say to you: Help yourselves, for  England has not a guinea for your assistance, and if England does not pay,  Austria, Russia, Prussia, which have only courage and no money, cannot support  more than one campaign or two against France.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我要用非常通俗的语言对你们说：英国再无一个苏来为这种高尚的事业服务。就是皮特本人回来，用上他全部的天才，也不能欺骗英国的小业主了，因为他们知道，短短的滑铁卢战役就花了他们十亿法郎。既然有人要我把话说明白，”报告人越来越激动，“那我就告诉你们：你们自己帮自己吧。因为英国没有一基尼给你们，要是英国不出钱，奥地利、俄罗斯、普鲁士只能跟法国打一个或两战役，他们只有勇气，没有钱。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  may hope that the young soldiers collected by Jacobinism will be defeated in  the first campaign, in the second perhaps; but in the third (though I pass for  a revolutionary in your prejudiced eyes), in the third you will have the  soldiers of 1794, who were no longer the recruited peasants of 1792.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们可以指望，用雅各宾主义聚集起来的年轻士兵在第一个战役、也许还有第二个战役被打败；但是第三个战役呢，即便我在你们有偏见的眼睛里是个革命者，我也要说，在第三个战役，你们面对的将是一七九四年的士兵，他们不再是一七九二年入伍的农民了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Here  the interruption broke out in three or four places at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，三、四个人从不同方向同时打断他的话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir,'  said the chairman to Julien, 'go and make a fair copy in the next room of the  first part of the report which you have taken down.' Julien left the room with  considerable regret. The speaker had referred to probabilities which formed the  subject of his habitual meditations.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，”主席对于连说，“到隔壁房间去把记录的开头部分誊清。”于连出去了，深感遗憾。报告人刚刚谈到的种种可能性，正是他平时深思的主题。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'They  are afraid of my laughing at them,' he thought. When he was recalled, M. de La  Mole was saying, with an earnestness, which, to Julien, who knew him, seemed  highly amusing:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他们害怕我嘲笑他们，”他想。再叫他进去时，德·拉莫尔先生在发言，那股严肃劲儿，对于了解他的于连来说，显得很滑稽：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  Gentlemen, it is above all of this unhappy race that one can say: </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“……是的，先生们，尤其是关于这不幸的人民，我们可以说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>&quot;Shall  it be a god, a table or a bowl?&quot;'&quot;It  shall be a god!&quot; cries the poet. It is to you, Gentlemen, that this  saying, so noble and so profound, seems to apply. Act for yourselves, and our  noble France will reappear more or less as our ancestors made her and as our  own eyes beheld her before the death of Louis XVI.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>是刻成神像，桌子还是脸盆？我要把它刻成神像！寓言家高声说。先生们，这句如此高贵如此深刻的话似乎应该由你们说出来。依靠你们自己的力量行动吧，如此则高贵的法国会再度出现，差不多就像我们的先人创建的那样，就像我们在路易十六逝世前看见的那样。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'England,  her noble Lords at least, curses as heartily as we ignoble Jacobinism: without  English gold, Austria, Russia, Prussia cannot fight more than two or three  battles. Will that suffice to bring about a glorious occupation, like that  which M. de Richelieu squandered so stupidly in 1817? I do not think so.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“英国，至少它那些高贵的爵爷，像我们一样憎恨可恶的雅各宾主义：没有英国的黄金，奥地利、俄罗斯、普鲁士只能打两三仗。这足以导致一次有效的军事占领，例如德·黎塞留先生一八一七年如此愚蠢地浪费掉的军事占领吗？我不相信。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  this point an interruption occurred, but it was silenced by a general murmur.  It arose once more from the former Imperial General, who desired the Blue  Riband, and was anxious to appear among the compilers of the secret note.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，有人打断他，但被所有人的“嘘”声压住了。插嘴的人又是前帝国将军，他想获得蓝绶带，在秘密记录的起草人当中冒尖儿。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  do not think so,' M. de La Mole resumed after the disturbance. He dwelt upon  the word 'I' with an insolence which charmed Julien. 'That is well played,' he  said to himself as he made his pen fly almost as fast as the Marquis's  utterance. With a wellplaced word, M. de La Mole annihilated the twenty  campaigns of the turncoat.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不相信，”一阵混乱之后，德·拉莫尔先生又说。他强调那个“我”字，那股傲慢劲儿迷住了于连。“这才叫高明，”他心想，一面走笔如飞，几乎跟侯爵说的一样快。“德·拉莫尔先生一句妙语消灭了这个变节分子二十个战役。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is not to foreigners alone,' the Marquis continued in the most measured tone,  'that we can remain indebted for a fresh military occupation.That  youthful band who contribute incendiary articles to the Globe will provide you  with three or four thousand young captains, among whom may be found a Kleber, a  Hoche, a Jourdan, a Pichegru, but less well intentioned.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一次新的军事占领，”侯爵字斟句酌地说，“我不单单依靠外国。在《环球报》上写煽动性文章的那些年轻人，可以向你们提供三四千名军官，其中可能就有一位克莱贝尔、一位奥什，一位儒尔丹，一位皮舍格吕，不过最后一位居心不良。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'We  did wrong in not crowning him with glory,' said the chairman,'we ought to have  made him immortal.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们没有能给他荣誉，”主席说，“应该让他永垂不朽。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'There  must, in short, be two parties in France,' went on M. de La Mole, 'but two  parties, not in name only, two parties clearly defined,sharply divided. Let us  be certain whom we have to crush. On one side the journalists, the electors,  public opinion; in a word, youth and all those who admire it. While it is dazed  by the sound of its own idle words, we, we have the certain advantage of  handling the budget.'</p>

<p>“总之，法国应该有两个党，”德·拉莫尔侯爵又说，“不是徒有其名的两个党，而是立场鲜明、判然有别的两个党。让我们弄清楚应该打垮谁吧。一方是记者，选民，一句话，舆论；青年以及一切欣赏青年的人。当他们被空话的聒噪冲昏头脑的时候，我们呢，我们就有了花费预算这一切切实实的好处了。”</p>

<p>Here  came a fresh interruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这时又有人插嘴。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You,  Sir,' M. de La Mole said to the interrupter with a supercilious ease that was  quite admirable, 'you do not handle, since the word appears to shock you, you  devour forty thousand francs borne on the state budget and eighty thousand  which you receive from the Civil List.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您，先生，”德·拉莫尔先生对插嘴的人说，那高傲，那自得，真叫人佩服，“您不花，如果您觉得这个词刺耳的话，而您是吞了列入国家预算的四万法郎，还有您从王室经费里得到的八万法郎。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very  well, Sir, since you force me to it, I take you boldly as an example. Like your  noble ancestors who followed Saint Louis to the Crusade, you ought, for those  hundred and twenty thousand francs, to let us see at least a regiment, a  company, shall I say a halfcompany, were it composed only of fifty men ready to  fight, and devoted to the good cause, alive or dead. You have only footmen who,  in the event of a revolt, would frighten nobody but yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好吧，先生，既然您强迫我，我就斗胆以您为例。您的高贵的先人曾跟随圣路易参加十字军东征，为了这十二万法郎，您就应该至少组建一个团，一个连，我怎么说呢！半个连，哪怕是只有五十个人，只要他们随时准备战斗，忠实于高尚的事业，置生死于不顾，然而您只有仆人，一旦发生暴乱，他们还让您害怕呢。</p>

<p>The  Throne, the Altar, the Nobility may perish any day, Gentlemen, so long as you  have not created in each Department a force of five hundred devoted men;  devoted, I mean, not only with all the gallantry of France but with the  constancy of Spain.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“王座，祭坛、贵族，明天都可能灭亡，先生们，只要你们不在每个省建立一支拥有五百个忠诚的人的力量；而我说的忠诚，不仅仅包括法国人的勇敢，还包括西班牙人的坚忍。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'One  half of this troop will have to be composed of our sons, our nephews, in short  of true gentlemen. Each of them will have by his side, not a glib little  cockney ready to hoist the striped cockade if another 1815 should arrive, but  an honest peasant, simple and open like Cathelineau;our gentleman will have  trained him, it should be his fosterbrother, if possible. Let each of us  sacrifice the fifth part of his income to form this little devoted troop of  five hundred men to a Department. Then you may count upon a foreign occupation.  Never will the foreign soldier cross our borders as far as Dijon even, unless  he is certain of finding five hundred friendly soldiers in each Department.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这支队伍的一半要由我们的孩子，我们的侄子，总之要由真正的贵族子弟组成。他们每一个人的身边都要有一个人，不是夸夸其谈的、一旦一八一五年重现就戴上三色帽徽的小资产者，而是一个像卡特利诺那样的单纯而坦率的好农民；我们的贵族子弟要教育他，可能的话，把他变成他的奶兄弟。让我们每个人都牺牲收入的五分之一在每个省都建立这样一支五百人的忠诚队伍吧。那时候你们就可以指望一次外国人的军事占领了。外国士兵如果没有把握能在每个省里找到五百名友好的士兵，是连第戎也不会到的。</p>

<p>'The  foreign Kings will listen to you only when you can inform them that there are  twenty thousand gentlemen ready to take up arms to open to them the gates of  France. This service is arduous, you will say. Gentlemen, it is the price of  our heads. Between the liberty of the press and our existence as gentlemen,  there is war to the knife. Become manufacturers, peasants, or take up your  guns. Be timid if you like, but do not be stupid.Open  your eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“外国的君主们，只有当你们告诉他们有两万贵族子弟随时准备拿起武器打开法国的大门，才会听你们的。你们会说，这件事很难；然而先生们，我们的脑袋值这个价。在新闻自由和我们作为贵族的生存之间，是殊死的战争。去做工厂主、做农民吧，要不就拿起你们的枪。如果愿意，你们可以胆怯，但是不要愚蠢；睁开眼睛吧。</p>

<p>'Form  your battalions, I say to you, in the words of the Jacobin song;then there will  appear some noble Gustavus Adolphus, who, moved by the imminent peril to the  monarchical principle will come flying three hundred leagues beyond his borders,  and do for you what Gustavus did for the Protestant princes. Do you propose to  go on talking without acting? In fifty years there will be nothing in Europe  but Presidents of Republics, not one King left. And with those four letters  KING, go the priests and the gentlemen. I can see nothing but candidates paying  court to draggletailed majorities.</p>

<p>“组织起你们的队伍，我要用雅各宾党人的这句歌词对你们说；那时候就会有某个高贵的居斯塔夫－阿道尔夫，有感于王政原则的燃眉之急，冲向距家园三百里以外的地方，为你们做出居斯塔夫为新教诸亲王所做的事情。你们还想继续空谈而不行动吗？五十年后，欧洲将只有共和国总统而没有国王了。随着国王这两个字消失，僧侣和贵族也将消失。我只看见一些候选人讨好肮脏的民众。</p>

<p>'It  is no use your saying that France has not at this moment a trust worthy  General, known and loved by all, that the army is organised only in the  interests of Throne and Altar, that all the old soldiers have been discharged  from it, whereas each of the Prussian and Austrian regiments includes fifty  noncommissioned officers who have been under fire.</p>

<p>“你们说，法国此刻没有一位人人信赖、熟悉、爱戴的将军，组织军队是为了王座和祭坛的利益，老兵都被清除了，而普鲁士和奥地利的每个团里都有五十个打过仗的下级军官，这统统没有用。</p>

<p>'Enough  unpleasant truths,' came in a tone of importance from a grave personage,  apparently high on the ladder of ecclesiastical preferment, for M. de La Mole  smiled pleasantly instead of showing annoyance, which was highly significant to  Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不要再提这些不愉快的事实了，”一个表情庄重的人说，口吻颇自负，显然在教会里地位极高；因为德·拉莫尔先生没有生气，反而讨好地笑笑，这对于连来说是一个重大的迹象。</p>

<div class="right">
<p>“总而言之，不要再提起这些不愉快的事实了，先生们：一个人的腿患了坏疽要锯掉，就不能对外科医生说：‘这条坏腿还很健康。’让我借用这个说法吧，先生们，高贵的德·某某公爵就是我们的外科医生……”</p>
