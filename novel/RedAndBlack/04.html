  <div class="left">'My wife certainly has a head on her shoulders!' the Mayor of Verrieres remarked to himself the following morning at six o'clock, as he made his way down to Pere Sorel's sawmill. 'Although I said so to her, to maintain my own superiority, it had never occurred to me that if I do not take this little priest Sorel, who, they tell me, knows his Latin like an angel, the governor of the poorhouse, that restless spirit, might very well have the same idea, and snatch him from me, I can hear the tone of conceit with which he would speak of his children's tutor!… This tutor, once I've secured him, will he wear a cassock?'</div>
  <div class="right">第二天早晨六点钟，维里埃的市长前往坡下索老爹的锯木厂。他一边走，一边想：“我的妻子的确很有头脑。优势当然还在我这边，但是说一千道一万，我毕竟没有想到，倘若我不把索莱尔这个小神甫弄到手，据说他的拉丁文好得不得了，收容所所长那个脑子转个不停的家伙很可能和我打一样的主意，并且抢在我的前头。他将以多么自负的口吻谈论他的孩子的家庭教师啊……这位家庭教师一旦属于我，要不要穿黑袍子呢？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">M. de Renal was absorbed in this question when he saw in the distance a peasant, a man of nearly six feet in height, who, by the first dawning light, seemed to be busily occupied in measuring pieces of timber lying by the side of the Doubs, upon the towpath. The peasant did not appear any too well pleased to see the Mayor coming towards him; for his pieces of wood were blocking the path, and had been laid there in contravention of the law.</div>
  <div class="right">德.莱纳先生在这个问题上颠来倒去，犹豫不决，突然，他看见一个乡巴佬，身高近六尺，大清早就似乎忙着丈量堆放在河边纤道上的木材。这乡巴佬看见市长先生走近好像不大高兴，这些木材堵塞了道路，堆放在那儿是违章的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Pere Sorel, for it was he, was greatly surprised and even more pleased by the singular offer which M. de Renal made him with regard to his son Julien. He listened to it nevertheless with that air of grudging melancholy and lack of interest which the shrewd inhabitants of those mountains know so well how to assume. Slaves in the days of Spanish rule,they still retain this facial characteristic of the Egyptian fellahin.</div>
  <div class="right">这乡巴佬正是索老爹。德.莱纳先生关于他的儿子于连的提议使他大感意外，但更使他感到高兴。不过他听的时候仍然带着那种愁苦不乐和漠不关心的神情，这山区的居民很善于这样来掩饰他们的精明。他们在西班牙人统治时期当过奴隶，如今仍保留着埃及小农的这种表情特征。
</div></div>


  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Sorel's reply was at first nothing more than a long-winded recital of all the formal terms of respect which he knew by heart. While he was repeating these vain words, with an awkward smile which enhanced the air of falsehood and almost of rascality natural to his countenance, the old peasant's active mind was seeking to discover what reason could be inducing so important a personage to take his scapegrace of a son into his establishment. He was thoroughly dissatisfied with Julien, and it was for Julien that M. de Renal was offering him the astounding wage of 300 francs annually, in addition to his food and even his clothing . This last condition, which Pere Sorel had had the intelligence to advance on the spur of the moment, had been granted with equal readiness by M. de Renal.</p></div>
  <div class="right">索莱尔的开场白只不过是大段背下来的记得滚瓜烂熟的客套话。他笨拙地做出微笑的样子，却更暴露出神情的虚假；他本来生就一副无赖相，这下反而欲盖弥彰。他一边重复着那些废话，一边脑子里不停地转，试图弄明白是什么原因能使一个如此有权势的人想把他那废物儿子搞到家里去。他很不喜欢于连，可是德.莱纳先生偏偏要给他—年三百法郎的工钱，管吃，甚至还管穿。这后一项要求是索老爹灵机一动突然提出来的，德.莱纳先生也是灵机一动突然答应的。</p>
</div></div>


  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">This demand impressed the Mayor. 'Since Sorel is not delighted and overwhelmed by my proposal, as he ought naturally to be, it is clear,' he said to himself, 'that overtures have been made to him from another quarter; and from whom can they have come, except from Valenod?' It was in vain that M. de Renal urged Sorel to conclude the bargain there and then: the <a href="#" title="美 [ə'stut]

  <div class="right">这一要求使德.莱纳先生大吃一惊。他想：“对我的提议，索莱尔竟没有理所当然地感到高兴和满意，显然已另外有人向他提出过什么，除了瓦勒诺先生之外，还能是谁呢？”德.莱纳先生催促索莱尔立刻定下来，然而没有用；老农民诡计多端，死活不同意；他说他想征求一下儿子的意见，好像在外省一个有钱的父亲除了走形式外还真地要问问一无所有的儿子似的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">A sawmill consists of a shed by the side of a stream. The roof is held up by rafters supported on four stout wooden pillars. Nine or ten feet from the ground, in the middle of the shed, one sees a saw which moves up and down, while an extremely simple mechanism thrusts forward against this saw a piece of wood. This is a wheel set in motion by the mill <a href="#" title="1.

  <div class="right">一座水力锯木厂其实就是一个建在水边的大棚，四根粗大的木柱支起屋架，上面复有棚顶。棚子中央八、九尺高处有一把锯上上下下，一种很简单的机器把木头对着锯推过去。溪水推动一个轮子，产生两种机械作用：一是锯的上下运动，二是缓缓推向锯子，最后破成板子。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">As he approached his mill, Pere Sorel called Julien in his stentorian voice; there was no answer. He saw only his two elder sons, young giants who, armed with heavy axes, were squaring the trunks of fir which they would afterwards carry to the saw. They were completely engrossed in keeping exactly to the black line traced on the piece of wood,from which each blow of the axe sent huge chips flying. They did not hear their father's voice. He made his way to the shed; as he entered it,he looked in vain for Julien in the place where he ought to have been standing, beside the saw. He caught sight of him five or six feet higher up, sitting astride upon one of the beams of the roof. Instead of paying careful attention to the action of the machinery, Julien was reading a book. Nothing could have been less to old Sorel's liking; he might perhaps have forgiven Julien his slender build, little adapted to hard work,and so different from that of his elder brothers; but this passion for reading he detested: he himself was unable to read.</div>
  <div class="right">索老爹走近工厂时，亮出大嗓门，高喊于连，没有人应声。他只看见两个大儿子，他们生得膀大腰圆，正挥动沉重的斧子整理枞树干，好送上去锯。他们仔细对准画好的黑线，一斧子下去就是一大堆木屑。他们没有听见父亲的喊声。他朝大棚走去，进去一看，于连没有守在锯旁，却骑在五、六尺高处的棚顶的一根梁上。于连不专心照看机器的运转，却在埋头读书。老索莱尔对此最为反感，他可以原谅于连身材瘦削，跟他的两个哥哥不一样，不适合干力气活儿，但他不能容忍于连的这种读书癖，因为他自己不识字。 </div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">It was in vain that he called Julien two or three times. The attention the young man was paying to his book, far more than the noise of the saw,prevented him from hearing his father's terrifying voice. Finally, despite his years, the father sprang nimbly upon the trunk that was being cut by the saw, and from there on to the cross beam that held up the roof. A violent blow sent flying into the mill lade the book that Julien was holding;a second blow no less violent, aimed at his head, in the form of a box on the ear, made him lose his balance. He was about to fall from a height of twelve or fifteen feet, among the moving machinery, which would have crushed him, but his father caught him with his left hand as he fell.</div>
  <div class="right">他叫了于连两、三声，还是白费力气。年轻人的注意力全在书本上，加上锯子的嘈杂声，更使他听不见父亲那可怕的声音。这父亲虽然年纪大了，却仍敏捷地跳上正在锯着的一个树干，又跳上支撑着棚顶的横梁，猛地一掌，把于连拿着的书打落到河里，接着又是猛地一掌，打在于连的头上。于连身子一歪，眼看就要跌倒，若是跌进十四、五尺下面正在运转的机器的杠杆中间，非粉身碎骨不可；这当儿，他的父亲伸出左手，一把将他揪住：</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Well, idler! So you keep on reading your cursed books, when you ought to be watching the saw? Read them in the evening, when you go and waste your time with the cure.'

</div>
  <div class="right">“好哇，懒鬼！你看锯的时候还要读你那些该死的书吗？你晚上去神甫那儿瞎混的时候再读吧，那是你看书的时候。”</div></div>
  
  
   
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Julien, although stunned by the force of the blow, and bleeding profusely, went to take up his proper station beside the saw. There were tears in his eyes, due not so much to his bodily pain as to the loss of his book, which he adored.


</div>
  <div class="right">于连被打得晕头转向，满脸是血，还得回到锯子旁自己的岗位上去。他的眼里含着泪，肉体的痛苦自不待言，更重要的原因是他失去了心爱的书。</div></div>
   
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">'Come down, animal, till I speak to you.' The noise of the machine again prevented Julien from hearing this order. His father who had stepped down not wishing to take the trouble to climb up again on to the machine, went to find a long pole used for knocking down walnuts, and struck him on the shoulder with it. No sooner had Julien reached the ground than old Sorel, thrusting him on brutally from behind, drove him towards the house. 'Heaven knows what he's going to do to me!' thought the young man. As he passed it, he looked sadly at the mill lade into which his book had fallen; it was the one that he valued most of all, the <a href="#" title="[mə'mɔːriəl]

</div>
  <div class="right">“下来，畜生，我有话跟你说。”机器的声音仍使于连听不见这命令。他的父亲已经下地，不愿再登上机器，就找了一根打胡桃的长杆子，抽他的肩膀。于连脚刚一落地，老索莱尔就推推搡搡地把他往家里赶。“天知道他又要把我怎么样！”年轻人心里嘀咕。他一边走，一边看着那条小溪，真伤心啊，他的书就掉在那里面；那是他最喜欢的《圣赫勒拿岛回忆录》。</div></div>
  
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">His cheeks were flushed, his eyes downcast. He was a slim youth of eighteen or nineteen, weak in appearance, with irregular but delicate features and an aquiline nose. His large dark eyes, which, in moments of calm, suggested a reflective, fiery spirit, were animated at this instant with an expression of the most ferocious hatred. Hair of a dark chestnut,growing very low, gave him a narrow brow, and in moments of anger a wicked air. Among the innumerable varieties of the human countenance,there is perhaps none that is more strikingly characteristic. A slim and shapely figure betokened suppleness rather than strength. In his child hood, his extremely pensive air and marked pallor had given his father the idea that he would not live, or would live only to be a burden upon his family. An object of contempt to the rest of the household, he hated his brothers and father; in the games on Sundays, on the public square,he was invariably beaten.</div>
  <div class="right">于连双颊绯红，两眼低垂，他是个十八、九岁的瘦小青年，看起来羸弱，面部的轮廓也不大周正，但颇清秀，还有一个鹰勾鼻子。一双大而黑的眼睛，静时显露出沉思和热情。此刻却闪烁着最凶恶的憎恨的表情。深褐色的头发长得很低，盖住了大半个额头，发怒的时候凶相毕露，人的相貌无数，然而更具惊人的特性者怕是没有了。他的身材修长而匀称，更多地显示出轻捷而非力量。自幼年起，他那极端沉思的神情和极为苍白的脸色，就使他的父亲以为他活不长，或者将成为家庭的负担，家里人都看不起他，他也恨父亲和两个哥哥；礼拜天在广场上玩耍，他总是挨打。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">It was only during the last year that his good looks had begun to win him a few supporters among the girls. Universally despised, as a feeble creature, Julien had adored that old Surgeon-Major who one day ventured to speak to the Mayor on the subject of the plane trees.</div>
  <div class="right">不到一年以前，他那张漂亮的脸才开始博得年轻姑娘们几句亲切的话。于连被当作弱者受到众人的轻蔑，然而他崇拜那位敢于和市长谈论悬铃木的老外科军医。</div></div>

  <div class="left">This surgeon used now and then to pay old Sorel a day's wage for his son, and taught him Latin and history, that is to say all the history that he knew, that of the 1796 campaign  in Italy.

Julien's great dark eyes, filled with tears, found themselves starting into the little grey eyes of the old peasant, who looked as though he sought to penetrate to the depths of his son's heart.</div>
  <div class="right">“老实回答我，”老农民对着他的耳朵厉声喝道，一边用手把他扳过来，好像小孩用手扳铅制玩具兵一样。于连那双又大又黑，泪汪汪的眼睛遇上了老木匠的一双灰色的、凶恶的小眼睛，这老木匠似乎想把他的灵魂深处看个一清二楚。 </div></div>
