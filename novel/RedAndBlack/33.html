<p>That  immense valley filled with brilliant lights and with all those thousands of  people dazzles my sight. Not one of them knows me, all are superior to me. My  head reels. Poemi dell' avvocato,</p>

  <div class="left"><p>Early  in the morning of the following day, Julien was copying letters in the library,  when Mademoiselle Mathilde entered by a little private door, cleverly concealed  with shelves of dummy books. While Julien was admiring this device,  Mademoiselle Mathilde appeared greatly surprised and distinctly annoyed to see  him there. Julien decided that her curlpapers gave her a hard, haughty, almost  masculine air. Mademoiselle de La Mole had a secret habit of stealing books  from her father's library, undetected. Julien's presence frustrated her  expedition that morning, which annoyed her all the more as she had come to  secure the second volume of Voltaire's Princesse de Babylone, a fitting  complement to an eminently monarchical and religious education, a triumph on  the part of the Sacre Coeur! This poor girl, at nineteen, already required the  spice of wit to make her interested in a novel.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>第二天一大早，于连正在书房抄写信件，玛蒂尔德小姐从一扇用书脊掩藏得严严实实的小旁门进来了。这办法令于连赞叹不已，玛蒂尔德小姐却好像大吃一惊，相当不高兴在这个地方碰上他。她头上卷着纸卷儿，于连觉得她神情严厉，高傲，几乎有一种阳刚之气。玛蒂尔德小姐有办法偷她父亲书房里的书而不露痕迹。于连的在场让她这天早上白跑了一趟，更使她不快的是，她来找伏尔泰的《巴比伦公主》第二卷；对于一种非常王政、非常宗教的教育、圣心派的杰作来说，这真是一个当之无槐的补充！这可怜的姑娘，才十九岁，就已经需要精神的刺激才能对一本小说感兴趣。
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Comte  Norbert appeared in the library about three o'clock; he had come to study a  newspaper, in order to be able to talk politics that evening, and was quite  pleased to find Julien, whose existence he had forgotten. He was charming to  him, and offered to lend him a horse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>将近三点钟，诺贝尔伯爵来到书房；他要研究一份报纸，晚上好能谈谈政治。他遇见于连很高兴，其实他早已把他给忘了。于连觉得他样样都好，他约于连骑马。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  father is letting us off until dinner.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我父亲放我们假直到晚饭。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  appreciated this us, and thought it charming.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连知道这个我们是什么意思，觉得这两个字很可爱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Heavens,  Monsieur le Comte,' said Julien, 'if it were a question of felling an  eighty-foot tree, trimming it and sawing it into planks, I venture to say that  I should manage it well enough; but riding a horse is a thing I haven't done  six times in my life.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的天主，伯爵先生，”于连说，“要是放倒一棵八十尺高的树，把它劈方正，破成板子，我可以说能做得很好；可是骑马，我这辈子总共还不到六次。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well,  this will be the seventh,' said Norbert.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那好，这回是第七次，”诺贝尔说，</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Privately,  Julien remembered the entry of the King of —— into Verrieres and imagined  himself a superior horseman. But, on their way back from the Bois de Boulogne,  in the very middle of the Rue du Bac, he fell off, while trying to avoid a  passing cab, and covered himself in mud. It was fortunate for him that he had a  change of clothes. At the dinner the Marquis, wishing to include him in the  conversation, asked him about his ride; Norbert made haste to reply in generous  language.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>其实，于连想起了国王驾临维里埃，认为自己骑马很高明。然而，从布洛涅森林回来，走在巴克街正中央，猝不及防，想躲避一辆双轮轻便马车，就从马上摔了下来，弄了一身泥。幸好他有两套礼服。吃晚饭时，侯爵想跟他说说话，便问他骑马散步的情况；诺贝尔急忙含含糊糊地说了说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monsieur  le Comte is too kind to me,' put in Julien. 'I thank him for it, and fully  appreciate his kindness. He has been so good as to give me the quietest and  handsomest of horses; but after all he could not glue me on to it, and, that  being so, I fell off right in the middle of that very long street near the  bridge.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“伯爵先生对我的照顾无微不至，”于连接着说，“我感谢他，我也很珍惜，他让人给了我一匹最温顺最漂亮的马，然而终究不能把我拴在马上啊，由于少了这一预防措施，我就在那条长长的、靠近桥的街中央摔了下来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  Mathilde tried in vain to stifle a peal of laughter; finally indiscretion  prevailed and she begged for details. Julien emerged from the difficulty with  great simplicity; he had an unconscious grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德小姐忍不住哈哈笑了起来，接着又不顾冒昧，细细地问下去。于连照直回答，非常爽快；他是有风度的，只是不自知罢了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  augur well of this little priest,' the Marquis said to the Academician; 'a  simple countryman in such a scrape! Such a thing was never yet seen and never  will be seen; in addition to which he relates his misadventure before the  ladies!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我想这个小教士将来会有出息的，”侯爵对院士说，“一个外省人在这种场合下居然能应付自如！这是从未见过的，将来也不会见到了；况且他还是在女士们面前诉说他的不幸！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  set his listeners so thoroughly at ease over his mishap that at the end of  dinner, when the general conversation had taken another turn, Mademoiselle  Mathilde began to ply her brother with questions as to the details of the  distressing event. As her inquiry continued, and as Julien more than once  caught her eye, he ventured to reply directly, although he had not been  questioned, and all three ended in laughter, just like three young peasants  from a village in the heart of a forest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连讲述他的倒霉遭遇，让听的人那么愉快；饭都快吃完了，大家的话题也已转了，玛蒂尔德小姐还向她哥哥询问这一不幸事件的细节。她的问题没个完，于连几次遇见她的目光，虽然未被问到，也敢直接回答，三个人最后笑作一处，就像住在树林深处村子里的三个年轻人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the following day Julien attended two lectures on theology, and then returned  to transcribe a score of letters. He found ensconced by his own place in the  library a young man dressed with great neatness, but his general appearance was  ignominious and his expression one of envy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天，于连听了两堂神学课，回来又抄了二十来封信。他发现在图书室里，他的身边，坐着一个年轻人，穿着十分讲究；但是形容猥琐，脸上带着嫉妒的表情。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis entered.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>侯爵进来了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  are you doing here, Monsieur Tanbeau?' he asked the newcomer in a severe tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您在这儿干什么，唐博先生？”他口气严厉地对新来的那个人说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  thought,' the young man began with a servile smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我原以为……”年轻人说，奴颜卑膝地笑了笑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No,  Sir, you did not think. This is an attempt, but it is an unfortunate one.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不，先生，您不要原以为。那是试用，而结果不妙。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Young Tanbeau rose in a fury and left the  room. He was a nephew of the Academician, Madame de La Mole's friend, and was  intended for a literary career. The Academician had persuaded the Marquis to  take him as a secretary. Tanbeau, who worked in a room apart, having heard of  the favour that was being bestowed upon Julien, was anxious to share it, and that  morning had come and set up his desk in the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>年轻的唐博愤愤地站了起来，走了。他是德·拉莫尔夫人的院士朋友的一个侄子，打算作个文人。院士已经使侯爵同意收他作秘书。唐博原在一间偏远些的房间里工作，他知道于连受到了宠信，就想分享，于是早上把文具搬进了图书室。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  four o'clock, Julien ventured, after some hesitation, to seek out Comte  Norbert. This young gentleman was going out riding, and was somewhat  embarrassed, for his manners were perfect.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>四点钟，于连略微犹豫了一下，大着胆子来到诺贝尔伯爵的住处。伯爵正要去骑马，他感到为难，因为他是十分讲究礼貌的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  think,' he said to Julien, 'that presently you might go to the riding school;  and after a few weeks I shall be delighted to ride with you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我想，”他对于连说，“您就要到练马场去了；几个星期之后，我会很高兴和您一块儿骑马的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  wished to have the honour of thanking you for all your kindness to me; pray  believe, Sir,' Julien added with a most serious air, 'that I am fully conscious  of all that I owe you. If your horse is not injured as a result of my  clumsiness yesterday, and if it is free, I should like to ride it today.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我想有此荣幸，感谢您对我的关怀；请相信，先生，”于连说，神情很是严肃，“我欠您的我都感觉到了。如果您的马没有因我昨天的笨拙而受伤，而且这马空着，我想现在骑。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Faith,  my dear Sorel, on your own head be it! Assume that I have raised all the  objections that prudence demands; the fact is that it is four o'clock, we have  no time to lose.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好吧，我亲爱的索莱尔，一切风险由您自己承担。谨慎所要求的各种反对意见，您就假定我都向您提出过吧；不过现在已经四点钟，我们没有时间好耽搁了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  he was in the saddle:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连一骑上马，就对年轻的伯爵说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  must one do, not to fall off?' Julien asked the young Comte.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如何才能不摔下来？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'All  sorts of things,' replied Norbert with a shout of laughter: 'for in stance, sit  well back.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“要做的事情可多啦，”诺贝尔哈哈大笑，回答说，“比方说，身体后仰。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  began to trot. They were crossing the Place Louis XVI.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连催马大步小跑，他们在路易十六广场上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  Young hot-head, there are too many carriages here, and with care less drivers  too. Once you are on the ground, their tilburys will go bowling over you; they  are not going to risk hurting their horses' mouths by pulling up short.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！小冒失鬼，”诺贝尔说，“这儿车子太多了，而且赶车的都是些不谨慎的家伙！一旦摔下来，他们的马车会从您身上压过去；他们绝不会冒险猛停而把马的嘴勒坏。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  score of times Norbert saw Julien on the point of falling; but at last their  ride ended without mishap. On their return, the young Comte said to his sister:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有二十次，诺贝尔看见于连就要从马上摔下来，不过这次出游最后还是平安无事地结束了。回来后，年轻的伯爵对他妹妹说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Let  me introduce a regular daredevil.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我向你介绍一位大胆的冒失鬼。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  dinner, speaking to his father, down the length of the table, he did justice to  Julien's courage; it was all that one could praise in his method of riding.  During the day the young Comte had heard the men who were grooming the horses  in the yard make Julien's fall an excuse for the most outrageous mockery of  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
p>晚饭间，他和坐在桌子另一头的父亲说话，称赞于连胆子大，对于连的骑术也就能夸奖这么一点了。年轻的伯爵早晨听见在院子里洗刷马匹的仆人们谈论于连堕马的事，对他肆意嘲笑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  spite of all this kindness, Julien soon felt himself completely isolated among  this family. All their customs seemed strange to him, and he was always making  mistakes. His blunders were the delight of the footmen.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管有伯爵这样的照顾、于连还是很快就感到他在这个家庭中是完全孤立的。所有的习惯他都觉得怪，而且动则得咎。他的蠢事使那些贴身男仆们心花怒放。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe Pirard had gone off to his living. 'If Julien is a frail reed, let him  perish; if he is a man of courage, let him make his way by himself,' he  thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>彼拉神甫动身去他的本堂区了。“如果于连是一棵柔弱的芦苇，就让他毁灭吧；如果这是个勇敢的人，就让他自己走出困境吧，”他想。
