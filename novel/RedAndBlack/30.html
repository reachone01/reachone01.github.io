<p>There  is only one true nobility left; namely, the title of Duke; Marquis is absurd,  at the word Duke one turns one's head.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Review</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>如今只剩下一个贵族爵位，那就是公爵的爵位；侯爵是可笑的，人们听见公爵这两个字会转过头去。</p>
<p>《爱丁堡评论》</p></div>
</div>
 
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>The  Marquis de La Mole received the abbe Pirard without any of those little  mannerisms of a great gentleman, outwardly so polite, but so impertinent to him  who understands them. It would have been a waste of time, and the Marquis was  so far immersed in public business as to have no time to waste.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·拉莫尔侯爵接待彼拉神甫，毫无那种大贵人常有的繁文缛节，这等繁文缛节看上去彬彬有礼，但明眼人一望便知是多么地傲慢无礼。那是浪费时间，而侯爵在一些大事中已卷入很深，没有时间可以浪费。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  six months he had been intriguing to make both King and nation accept a certain  Ministry, which, as a mark of gratitude, would make him a Duke.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>六个月来，他一直忙于策划，想让国王和全国接受某种内阁，这内阁出于感激，会让他当上公爵。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marquis had appealed in vain, year after year, to his lawyer at Besancon for a  clear and definite report on his lawsuits in the Franche-Comte. How was the  eminent lawyer to explain them to him, if he did not understand them himself?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>多年以来，侯爵始终要求他的律师就他在弗朗什－孔泰的官司写一份清晰准确的报告，然而竟不可得。那位有名的律师自己都弄不明白，  如何能给他解释清楚呢？</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  little slip of paper which the abbe gave him explained everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>神甫给了他一方纸片，一切就都了然。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  dear abbe,' said the Marquis, after polishing off in less than five minutes all  the polite formulas and personal inquiries, 'my dear abbe, in the midst of my  supposed prosperity, I lack the time to occupy myself seriously with two little  matters which nevertheless are of considerable importance: my family and my  affairs. I take the greatest interest in the fortunes of my house, I may carry  it far; I look after my pleasures, and that is what must come before everything  else, at least in my eyes,' he went on, noticing the astonishment in the eyes  of the abbe Pirard. Although a man of sense, the abbe was amazed to see an old  man talking so openly of his pleasures.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我亲爱的神甫，”侯爵对他说，没用五分钟就说完一切客套话和关于个人事务的询问，“我亲爱的神甫，在我的所谓飞黄腾达中，我没  有时间去关心两件虽小却重要的事：我的家庭和我的买卖。我从大处注意家族的境遇，我可以便它有很远大的发展；我注意我的享乐，至少在我看来这是高于一切的事情，”他补了一句，无意中发现彼拉神甫眼中的惊奇。尽管神甫是个通情达理之人，还是因看见一个老人这样坦率地谈论自已的享乐而感到惊奇。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Work  does no doubt exist in Paris,' the great nobleman continued, 'but perched in  the attics; and as soon as I come in contact with a man, he takes an apartment  on the second floor, and his wife starts a day; consequently, no more work, no  effort except to be or to appear to be a man of fashion. That is their sole  interest once they are provided with bread.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“巴黎无疑有很多勤奋工作的人，”这位大贵人继续说，“但是我找到一个人来工作，他原来栖身在六层楼上，立刻就在三层租一套房子，妻子也选日子接待客人；结果他不再工作，不再努力，除非为了成为或显得像个上等人。这是他们有了面包之后唯一的事情。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'For  my lawsuits, to be strictly accurate, and also for each lawsuit separately, I  have lawyers who work themselves to death; one of them died of consumption, the  day before yesterday. But, for my affairs in general, would you believe, Sir,  that for the last three years I have given up hope of finding a man who, while  he is writing for me, will deign to think a little seriously of what he is  doing. However, all this is only a preamble.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“确切地说，为了我的诉讼，而且为了分开来看的每一件诉讼，我都有累得要死的律师，前天就有一位死于肺病。对于我的事务，总的来说，您相信吗，先生？三年来，我竟找不到一个人，在他为我写东西的时候肯多少认真地想想他在干什么。不过，刚才说的这些不过是个开场白而已。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  respect you, and, I would venture to add, although we meet for the first time,  I like you. Will you be my secretary, with a salary of eight thousand francs,  or indeed twice that sum? I shall gain even more, I assure you; and I shall  make it my business to keep your fine living for you, for the day on which we  cease to agree.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我尊敬您，我还敢说，尽管我第一次见到您，可我爱您。您愿意做我的秘书吗，薪水八千法郎或者加倍？我跟您打赌，即便如此，还是我赚。将来有一天我们彼此不再相得，我负责为您保留那个好堂区。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  abbe declined, but towards the end of the conversation, the sight of the  Marquis's genuine embarrassment suggested an idea to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>神甫拒绝了；不过，谈话快结束的时候，他看见侯爵确实作难，这倒启发他有了个主意。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have left down in my Seminary a poor young man who, if I be not mistaken, is  going to be brutally persecuted. If he were only a simple monk he would be  already in pace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我在神学院里丢下一个可怜的年轻人，如果我没有弄错的话，他在那儿将受到粗暴的迫害。如果他是个一般的教士，也早就inpace了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'At  present this young man knows only Latin and the Holy Scriptures; but it is by  no means impossible that one day he may display great talent, either for  preaching or for the guidance of souls. I do not know what he will do; but he  has the sacred fire, he may go far. I intended to give him to our Bishop,  should one ever be sent to us who had something of your way of looking at men  and affairs.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“迄今为止，这年轻人还只知道拉丁文和《圣经》；但是有朝一日他将施展巨大的才能，或者用于讲道，或者用于指导灵魂，这不是不可  能的，我不知道他将来做什么，但是他有神圣的热情，他有远大的前程。我原本打算把他荐给我们的主教，假如我们的主教多少有些您看人看事的方式的话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  is your young man's origin?' said the Marquis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您的年轻人什么出身？”侯爵问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  is said to be the son of a carpenter in our mountains, but I am inclined to  believe that he is the natural son of some rich man. I have seen him receive an  anonymous or pseudonymous letter containing a bill of exchange for five hundred  francs.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“大家说他是我们山里一个木匠的儿子，可我更相信他是某个富人的私生子。我曾见他接到一笔匿名或化名的信，其中有一张五百法郎的  汇票。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  It is Julien Sorel,' said the Marquis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！是于连·索莱尔，”侯爵说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  do you know his name?' asked the astonished abbe; and, as he was blushing at  his own question:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您从哪儿知道他的名字？”神甫惊奇地问，旋即因这问题而脸红了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is what I am not going to tell you,' replied the Marquis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这我就无可奉告了，”侯爵答道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very  well!' the abbe went on, 'you might try making him your secretary, he has  energy, and judgment; in short, it is an experiment worth trying.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那好！”神甫说，“您可以试试让他做您的秘书，他有毅力，有理智；一句话，值得一试。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why  not?' said the Marquis; 'but would he be the sort of man to let his palm be  greased by the Prefect of Police or by anyone else, to play the spy on me? That  is my only objection.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为什么不？”侯爵说，“不过，这是不是一个可以被警察或其他什么人收买来我家当密探的人呢？如若反对，这是唯一的理由。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Receiving  favourable assurances from the abbe Pirard, the Marquis produced a note for one  thousand francs:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在神甫做出有利的担保之后，侯爵取出一张一千法郎的钞票：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Send  this to Julien Sorel for his journey; tell him to come to me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“把这个寄给于连·索莱尔做盘缠，让他上我这儿来。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  can see,' said the abbe Pirard, 'that you live in Paris! You are unaware of the  tyranny that weighs upon us poor provincials, and especially upon priests who  are not on good terms with the Jesuits. They will never allow Julien Sorel to  leave, they will manage to cover themselves with the cleverest excuses, they  will reply that he is ill, letters will have gone astray in the post,' etc.,  etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一看就知道您住在巴黎。”彼拉神甫说，“您不知道专横暴虐是如何压在我们这些可怜的外省人身上的，尤其是那些不以耶稣会士为友  的教士们。他们不会让于连·索莱尔走的，他们会找出种种巧妙的借口，他们会跟我说他病了，邮局也会把信弄丢，等等，等等。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  of these days I shall procure a letter from the Minister to the Bishop,' said  the Marquis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我这几天让部长给主教写一封信，”侯爵说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  was forgetting one thing,' said the abbe: 'this young man, although of quite  humble birth, has a proud heart, he will be of no use to you if his pride is  offended; you will only make him stupid.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我忘了一件应该注意的事，”神甫说，“这年轻人尽管出身卑微，心气却高远，如果伤了他的自尊，他就不会有任何用处；您会使他变  得愚蠢。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  like that,' said the Marquis, 'I shall make him my son's companion, will that  do?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我喜欢这样，”侯爵说，“我让他做我儿子的朋友，这够了吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Some  time after this, Julien received a letter in an unknown hand and bearing the  postmark of Chalons, and found a draft upon a merchant in Besancon and  instructions to proceed to Paris without delay. The letter was signed with an  assumed name, but as he opened it Julien trembled:a  leaf from a tree had fallen out at his feet; it was the signal arranged between  him and the abbe Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不久，于连收到一封笔迹陌生的信，盖有夏隆的邮戳，内中有一张到贝藏松一商人处的取款凭证，还有一份立即前往巴黎的通知，信上署  的是假名，但是于连打开时不禁打了—个寒战：一片树叶落在脚下，这是他和彼拉神甫商定的暗号。</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Within  an hour, Julien was summoned to the Bishop's Palace, where he found himself  greeted with a wholly fatherly welcome. Interspersed with quotations from  Horace, Monseigneur paid him, with regard to the exalted destiny that awaited  him in Paris, a number of very neat compliments, which required an explanation  if he were to express his thanks.Julien  could say nothing, chiefly because he knew nothing, and Monseigneur showed a  high regard for him. One of the minor clergy of the Palace wrote to the Mayor  who made haste to appear in person bringing a passport already signed, but with  a blank space for the name of the traveller.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不到一个钟头，于连被叫到主教府，受到慈父般亲切的接待。主教大人一边背诵贺拉斯，一边恭维他，说在巴黎等待他的是远大的前程。而这些恭维话说得很巧妙，于连要感谢，就得作出解释。于连什么也说不出来，首先是因为他一无所知，主教大人却对他非常尊重。主教府的一个小教士写信给市长，市长急忙亲自送去一张签好的通行证，旅行者的姓名空着待填。</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Before  midnight, Julien was with Fouque, whose sober mind was more astonished than  delighted by the future which seemed to be in store for his friend.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当晚午夜之前，于连已到了富凯家，富凯是个明智的人，对等待着他的朋友的前途，与其说感到高兴，更多地是感到惊奇。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  end of it will be,' said this Liberal elector, 'a post under Government, which  will oblige you to take some action that will be pilloried in the newspapers.  It will be through your disgrace that I shall have news of you. Remember that,  even financially speaking, it is better to earn one hundred louis in an honest  trade in timber, where you are your own master, than to receive four thousand  francs from a Government, were it that of King Solomon himself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“对你来说，”这个自由派选举人说，“到头来可能得到一个政府的职位，那将迫使你做出一些会在报纸上受到抨击的行为。我将通过你  的耻辱得到你的消息。记住，即便从金钱上说，在自己作主的正当的木材生意中赚一百路易，也比从一个政府那里接受一千法郎强，哪怕是所罗门王的政府。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  saw no more in this than the pettiness of a rustic mind. He was at last going  to appear on the stage of great events. The good fortune of going to Paris,  which he peopled in his imagination with men of intelligence, great intriguers,  great hypocrites, but as courteous as the Bishop of Besancon and the Bishop of  Agde, eclipsed everything else in his eyes.He  represented himself to his friend as deprived of his free will by the abbe  Pirard's letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这些话只被于连看作是一个乡绅的思想狭隘。他终于要在大事件的舞台上亮相了。在他的想象中，巴黎到处是玩弄阴谋、极其虚伪却像贝藏松的主教和阿格德的主教一样彬彬有礼的才智之士。去巴黎的幸福驱散了他眼前的一切。他让他朋友觉得是彼拉神甫的信剥夺了他的自由意志。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Towards  noon on the following day he arrived in Verrieres the happiest of men, he  reckoned upon seeing Madame de Renal again. He went first of all to his  original protector, the good abbe Chelan. He met with a stern reception.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天将近中午，他到了维里埃，觉得自己是世上最幸福的人；他打算见见德·莱纳夫人。他首先到了他的第一位保护人善良的谢朗神甫家里。他受到的接待是严厉的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  you consider that you are under any obligation to me?' said M. Chelan, without  acknowledging his greeting. 'You will take luncheon with me, meanwhile another  horse will be hired for you, and you will leave Verrieres, without seeing  anyone.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您认为您受过我的恩惠吗？”谢朗先生说，没有理他的问候，“您跟我一道吃饭，这期间有人去为您另租一匹马，您离开维里埃，什么人也不要见。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  hear is to obey,' replied Julien, with the prim face of a seminarist; and there  was no further discussion save of theology and Latin scholarship.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“听见就是服从，”于连回答，作出一副神学院学生的样子；然后他们就只谈神学和优秀的拉丁作品。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  mounted his horse, rode a league, after which, coming upon a wood, with no one  to see him enter it, he hid himself there. At sunset he sent the horse back.  Later on, he entered the house of a peasant, who agreed to sell him a ladder,  and to go with him, carrying the ladder, to the little wood that overhung the  Cours de la Fidelite, in Verrieres.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他骑上马，走了一法里路，看见一片树林，四周没有人，就钻了进去。日落时分，他把马送回。稍晚，他走进一个农民的家里，那个农民  同意卖给他一个梯子，并且扛着跟他一直来到俯瞰维里埃的忠诚大道的那片树林。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'We  are a poor conscript deserting—or a smuggler,' said the peasant, as he took  leave of him, 'but what do I care? My ladder is well paid for, and I myself  have had to pass some awkward moments in my life.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他准是个可怜的逃避兵役的人……或者是个走私犯，”那农民跟他告别，心里说，“管它呢！反正我的梯子卖了好价钱，再说我自己这辈子也不是没倒腾过钟表零件。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  night was very dark. About one o'clock in the morning, Julien, carrying his  ladder, made his way into Verrieres. He climbed down as soon as he could into  the bed of the torrent, which ran through M. de Renal's magnificent gardens at  a depth of ten feet, and confined between walls.Julien  climbed up easily by his ladder. 'What sort of greeting will the watchdogs give  me?' he wondered. 'That is the whole question.' The dogs barked, and rushed  towards him; but he whistled softly, and they came and fawned upon him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>夜很黑。快到凌晨一点钟的时候，于连扛着梯子进了维里埃城。他尽早下到急流的河床里，这条急流穿过德·莱纳先生的漂亮花园，比花园低十尺，夹在两道护墙之间。有了梯子，于连很容易就爬上去了。“看家的狗将怎样迎接我呢？”于连想。全部问题就在这里。狗叫了起来，冲着他飞奔过去；他轻轻吹了声口哨，它们就对他表示亲昵了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Then  climbing from terrace to terrace, although all the gates were shut, he had no  difficulty in arriving immediately beneath the window of Madame de Renal's  bedroom, which, on the garden side, was no more than nine or ten feet above the  ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他登上一块台地又一块台地，尽管所有的栅栏门都关着，他还是很容易就到了德·莱纳夫人卧室的窗下。窗户朝着花园，距地面仅八尺到十尺高。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There was in the shutters a small opening  in the shape of a heart, which Julien knew well. To his great dismay, this  little opening was not lighted by the glimmer of a nightlight within.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>护窗板上开有一个心形小洞，于连很熟悉。可是这个小洞并没有像往常那样，被一盏守夜灯从里面照亮，这使于连大失所望。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Great  God!' he said to himself; 'tonight, of all nights, this room is not occupied by  Madame de Renal! Where can she be sleeping? The family are at Verrieres, since  I found the dogs here; but I may in this room, without a light, come upon M. de  Renal himself or a stranger, and then what a scandal!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“伟大的天主！”他自语道；“今天夜里德·莱纳夫人没住在这间房子里！她睡在哪间房子里呢？全家都在维里埃，因为我看见了狗；可  是在这间没有守夜灯的房子里，我可能会碰上德·莱纳先生本人或另一个陌生人，那将会引起怎样的一场风波啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  most prudent course was to retire; but the idea filled Julien with horror. 'If  it is a stranger, I shall make off as fast as my legs will carry me, leaving my  ladder behind; but if it is she, what sort of welcome awaits me? She is steeped  in repentance and the most extreme piety, I may be sure of that; but after all,  she has still some memory of me, since she has just written to me.' With this  argument he made up his mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>最谨慎的是后退，可是这个主意让于连感到厌恶。“如果是一个陌生人，我就丢下梯子撒腿跑掉；如果是她呢，等待我的是什么样的接待？她正沉浸在悔恨和极度的虔诚中，这我不能怀疑；可她总是还记得我，既然她刚给我写过信。”这番推理使他下了决心。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  heart trembling, but determined nevertheless to see her or to perish, he flung  a handful of gravel against the shutter; no reply. He placed his ladder against  the wall by the side of the window and tapped himself on the shutter, softly at  first then more loudly. 'Dark as it is, they may fire a gun at me,' thought  Julien. This thought reduced his mad under taking to a question of physical  courage.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的心在颤抖，然而他决心要么死要么见到她，就朝护窗板扔了几块小石子，没有回音。他把梯子靠在窗户旁，伸手敲护窗板，开始很轻，越敲越重。“不管天多么暗，他们还是能朝我开枪，”于连想。想到这里，他的疯狂之举就已成了一个胆子大小的问题了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  room is unoccupied tonight,' he thought, 'or else whoever it is that is  sleeping here is awake by this time. So there is no need for any further  precaution here; all I need think of is not making myself heard by the people  who are sleeping in the other rooms.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“今天夜里这间屋子没有人住，”他想，“不然的话，无论谁睡在里面，现在也该醒了。因此不必再瞻前顾后的了，只是要注意别让睡在别的屋子里的人听见。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  stepped down, placed his ladder against one of the shutters, climbed up again  and passing his hand through the heart-shaped opening, was fortunate in finding  almost at once the wire fastened to the latch that closed the shutter. He  pulled this wire; it was with an unspeakable joy that he felt that the shutter  was no longer closed and was yielding to his efforts. 'I must open it little by  little and let her recognise my voice.'He  opened the shutter sufficiently to pass his head through the gap, repeating in  a whisper: 'It is a friend.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他下来，把梯子对着一扇护窗板放好，又上去，把手伸进心形小洞，幸运地很快摸到系在关住护窗板的小钩子上的铁丝。他拉了拉铁丝，觉得护窗板动了，他心里真有说不出的高兴，一使劲就拉开护窗板，“要一点一点地开，让她认出我的声音。”他把护窗板开到可以把头伸进去，低声反复说道：“是朋友。”</p>

</div></div>

<p>He  made certain, by applying his ear, that nothing broke the profound silence in  the room. But decidedly, there was no nightlight, even half extinguished, on  the hearth; this was indeed a bad sign.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他仔细听了听，确信没有任何声音打破屋子里的沉寂。然而壁炉里确实没有守夜灯，半开着的也没有，这是一个不妙的迹象。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Beware  of a gunshot!' He thought for a moment; then, with one finger, ventured to tap  the pane: no response; he tapped more loudly. 'Even if I break the glass, I  must settle this business.' As he was knocking hard, he thought he could just  make out, in the pitch darkness, something like a white phantom coming across  the room. In a moment, there was no doubt about it, he did see a phantom which  seemed to be advancing with extreme slowness. Suddenly he saw a cheek pressed  to the pane to which his eye was applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“小心枪子儿！”他考虑了片刻，然后鼓起勇气用手指敲了敲窗户：没有回答；他使劲敲了敲。“就是敲碎破璃窗，也得干到底。”他敲  得很使劲，在极端的黑暗中，他相信恍惚看见有一个白色的影子穿过房间。终于，他不再怀疑了，他看见一个影子好像在极慢极慢地往前走。突然，他看见半个脸贴在他的眼睛凑得很近的那块玻璃上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  shuddered, and recoiled slightly. But the night was so dark that, even at this  close range, he could not make out whether it was Madame de Renal. He feared an  instinctive cry of alarm; he could hear the dogs prowling with muttered growls  round the foot of his ladder. 'It is I,' he repeated, quite loudly, 'a friend.'  No answer; the white phantom had vanished. 'For pity's sake, open the window. I  must speak to you, I am too wretched!' and he knocked until the window nearly  broke.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他打了个哆嗦，稍稍离远了些。然而，夜太黑了，就是离得这样近，他也不能分辨出那是不是德·莱纳夫人。他害怕她惊叫起来，他听见狗围着梯子转悠，低声地吠叫。“是我，”他反复地说，声音相当大，“一个朋友。”没有回答，白色的幽灵消失了。“请开开窗子，我得跟您说说，我太不幸了！”他使劲敲打，玻璃都快碎了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  little sharp sound was heard; the catch of the window gave way; he pushed it  open and sprang lightly into the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一记轻而脆的声音传来；窗子的插销拔开了，他推开窗户，轻轻一跳，进了屋子。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  white phantom moved away; he seized it by the arms; it was a woman. All his  ideas of courage melted. 'If it is she, what will she say to me?' What was his  state when he realised from a faint cry that it was Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>白色的幽灵闪开，他一把抓住它的胳膊；是一个女人。他的种种想表现得勇敢无畏的念头顿时化为乌有。“如果这是她，她会说什么？，  当他从一声轻轻的叫喊中听出那正是德·莱纳夫人时，他是何等地激动啊！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  gathered her in his arms; she trembled, and had barely the strength to repulse  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他把她抱在怀里，她浑身打颤，几乎没有力气把他推开。</p>

<p>'Go,  leave me this instant. Ah! M. Chelan, why did you forbid me to write to him? I  should have prevented this horror.' She thrust him from her with a force that  was indeed extraordinary. 'I repent of my crime; heaven has deigned to  enlighten me,' she repeated in a stifled voice. 'Go! </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“出去，立刻离开我。啊！谢朗先生，为什么阻止我给他写信呢？我本可以预先防止这种可怕的事呀。”她推开他，力气的确大得不同寻  常。“我对我的罪孽感到悔恨，蒙上天垂顾，让我迷途知返。”她反复说，声音断断续续。</p>

<p>In  spite of herself Madame de Renal felt this tone of authority exert its  influence over her heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不管德·莱纳夫人愿意不愿意，这种专横的口气还是在她的心上发生了效力。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien,  who was holding her in a passionate embrace, and resisting her efforts to  liberate herself, ceased to press her in his arms. This relaxation helped to  reassure Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连满怀激情地紧紧抱住她，不让她挣脱，然后稍稍松了松胳膊。这一动使德·莱纳夫人略感放心。</p>

<p>'I  am going to draw up the ladder,' he said, 'so that it may not compromise us if  one of the servants, awakened by the noise, goes the rounds.'</p>

<div class="right">

<p>“我去把梯子拉上来，”他说，“要是有哪个仆人被响声惊动起来查看，它会连累我们的。”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  Leave me, leave me rather,' the answer came with unfeigned anger. 'What do men  matter to me? It is God that sees the terrible wrong you are doing me, and will  punish me for it. You are taking a cowardly advantage of the regard that I once  felt for you, but no longer feel. Do you hear, Master Julien?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！那就连累吧，您出去，出去，”她对他说，真的生气了。“男人与我有什么关系？是天主看见了您跟我吵闹得这样可怕，并因此而  惩罚我。您真卑鄙，竟滥用我对您曾经有过的感情，这种感情我现在已经没有了。您听见了吗？于连先生？”</p>

<p>'Do  not speak to me so, for pity's sake, or I shall call my husband. I am all too  guilty already of not having sent you away, at any cost. I pity you,' she told  him, seeking to wound his pride which she knew to be so irritable.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不要这样跟我说话，求求您，不然我要叫我的丈夫了。我没有不顾一切地把您赶走，已经是犯了大罪了。我可怜您，”她说，试图刺伤  他的自尊，她知道这自尊是多么地敏感。</p>

<p>Her  refusal to use the tu form, that abrupt method of breaking so tender a bond,  and one upon which he still reckoned, roused Julien's amorous transport to a  frenzy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>拒绝称“你”，粗暴地斩断如此温柔而他还信赖的关系，这反而便于连的爱的激情达到了疯狂的程度。</p>

<p>'What!  Is it possible that you no longer love me!' he said to her, in those accents of  the heart to which it is so difficult to listen unmoved.</p>

<p>“怎么！这怎么可能，您不爱我了！”他说，那发自内心的声音，让人听了很难再保持冷静。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  so I am completely forgotten by the one person who has ever loved me! What use  to live any longer?' All his courage had left him as soon as he no longer had  to fear the danger of encountering a man; everything had vanished from his  heart, save love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这么说，我被唯一曾经爱过我的人完全地忘了！此后活着还有什么意思？”他不再害怕碰见一个男人有什么危险了，他的勇气完全地离  开了他，除了爱情，一切都已从他心中消失。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He  wept for a long time in silence. He took her hand, she tried to with draw it;  and yet, after a few almost convulsive movements, she let him keep it. The  darkness was intense; they found themselves both seated upon Madame de Renal's  bed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他幽幽地哭了许久。他抓起她的手，她想抽回，然而，几番痉挛地动了动，还是随他去了。夜黑极了，他们并排坐在床上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a difference from the state of things fourteen months ago!' thought Julien, and  his flow of tears increased. 'So absence unfailingly destroys all human  feelings!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这与十四个月之前是多么地不同啊！”于连想：眼泪流得更凶了。“这么说，人不在肯定要摧毁人的一切感情了！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Be  so kind as to tell me what has happened to you,' Julien said at length,  embarrassed by his silence and in a voice almost stifled by tears.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请跟我谈谈您的事，”于连终于说道，沉默使他发窘，声音也抽抽噎噎地。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There  can be no doubt,' replied Madame de Renal in a harsh voice, the tone of which  offered a cutting reproach to Julien, 'my misdeeds were known in the town, at  the time of your departure. You were so imprudent in your behaviour. Some time  later, when I was in despair, the respectable M. Chelan came to see me. It was  in vain that, for a long time, he sought to obtain a confession. One day, the  idea occurred to him to take me into that church at Dijon in which I made my  first Communion. There, he ventured to broach the subject… ' Madame de Renal's  speech was interrupted by her tears. 'What a shameful moment! I confessed all.  That worthy man was kind enough not to heap on me the weight of his  indignation: he shared my distress. At that time I was writing you day after  day letters which I dared not send you; I concealed them carefully, and when I  was too wretched used to shut myself up in my room and read over my own  letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“毫无疑问，”德·莱纳夫人回答道，声音严厉，语气中有某种无情和责备于连的味道，“您走的时候，我的失足已为全城的人所知。您  的举动里有那么多的不谨慎！不久，我陷入绝望，可敬的谢朗先生来看我。很长一段时间，他想让我坦白，然而没有用。一天，他有了个主意，带我去第戎那座我初领圣体的教堂。在那儿，他大胆地先说了……”德·莱纳夫人的话被泪水打断。“多么羞愧的时刻啊！我什么都坦白了。这个人多善良啊，他没有把他的愤怒压在我身上，反而跟我一起伤心。这期间，我每天都给您写信，可我不敢寄出；我小心地把信藏好，当我痛不欲生的时候，就躲在卧室里重读那些信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'At  length, M. Chelan persuaded me to hand them over to him…Some  of them, written with a little more prudence than the rest, had been sent to  you; never once did you answer me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“最后，谢朗先生说服我，把那些信交给了他……其中有几封，写得略微谨慎些，就寄给了您；您一封也不回。”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Never,  I swear to you, did I receive any letter from you at the Seminary.'</p>

<p>'God  in His mercy made me understand how greatly I was sinning against Him, against  my children, against my husband,' replied Madame de Renal. 'He has never loved  me as I believed then that you loved me…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“天主可怜我，让我明白我对他、对我的孩子，对我的丈夫犯了多大的罪，”德·莱纳夫人继续说“我以为他从未爱过我，而您却爱我…  …”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  flung himself into her arms, without any definite intention but with entire  lack of self-control. But Madame de Renal thrust him from her, and continued  quite firmly:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连一下子扑到她怀里，的确是没有预先的计划，是不由自主地。然而德·莱纳夫人推开他，相当坚决地继续说下去：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  respectable friend M. Chelan made me realise that, in marrying M. de Renal, I  had pledged all my affections to him, even those of which I was still ignorant,  which I had never felt before a certain fatal intimacy… Since the great  sacrifice of those letters, which were so precious to me, my life has flowed  on, if not happily, at any rate quietly enough. Do not disturb it any more; be  a friend to me… the best of friends.' Julien covered her hands with kisses; she  could feel that he was still crying. 'Do not cry, you distress me so … Tell me,  it is your turn now, all that you have been doing.' Julien was unable to speak.  'I wish to know what sort of life you led at the Seminary,' she repeated, 'then  you shall go.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的可敬的朋友谢朗先生让我明白，和德·莱纳先生结婚，就是做出保证，把我全部的感情都给了他，甚至包括我不知道的、在一次不  祥的关系之前从未体验过的那些……自从我把那些信交给了他，这些信对我来说是那样地宝贵，我的生活过得如果不幸福，至少也相当平静。别再搅乱它了；做我的一个朋友吧……最好的朋友。”于连在她手上印满了吻；她感觉到他还在哭。“别哭了，这真让我难受……该您告诉我您的事了。”于连说不出话来。“我想知道您在神学院里过的是什么样的生活，”她又说，“然后您就走吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Without  a thought of what he was telling her, Julien spoke of the endless intrigues and  jealousies which he had encountered at first, then of his more peaceful life  after he was appointed tutor.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连心不在焉，先说了他开始时遇到的无数阴谋和嫉妒，又说了当了辅导教师后较为平静的生活。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  was then,' he added, 'that after a long silence, which was doubtless intended  to make me understand what I see only too clearly now, that you no longer love  me, and that I had become as nothing to you… 'Madame  de Renal gripped his hands. 'It was then that you sent me a sum of five hundred  francs.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“正在这时候，”他补充道，“长时间的沉默之后，那沉默显然是让我明白您已不爱我了，我对您无关紧要了……”德·莱纳夫人抓紧了  他的手。“正在这时候，您给我寄了五百法郎。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Never,'  said Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我从未寄过，”德·莱纳夫人说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  was a letter postmarked Paris and signed Paul Sorel, to avoid all suspicion.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为了打消怀疑，那封信盖着巴黎的邮戳，署名是保尔·索莱尔。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  short discussion followed as to the possible source of this letter. The  atmosphere began to change. Unconsciously, Madame de Renal and Julien had  departed from their solemn tone; they had returned to that of a tender  intimacy. They could not see each other, so intense was the darkness, but the  sound of their voices told all. Julien slipped his arm round the waist of his  mistress; this movement was highly dangerous. She tried to remove Julien's arm,  whereupon he, with a certain adroitness, distracted her attention by an  interesting point in his narrative.The  arm was then forgotten, and remained in the position that it had occupied.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他们中间起了一阵小小的争论，争论那封信可能的来源。他们的精神状态于是为之一变。不知不觉中，德·莱纳夫人和于连已不再用庄重  的口吻说话，口吻中又恢复了那种温柔的友情。黑沉沉中，他们谁也看不见谁，然而说话的声音已说明一切。于连伸开胳膊，搂住了情人的腰，这举动很危险。她试着推开于连的胳膊，而他想当巧妙地用叙述中一个有趣的场景引开她的注意力。他的胳膊仿佛被遗忘，呆在了原来的地方。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  abundant conjectures as to the source of the letter with the five hundred  francs, Julien had resumed his narrative; he became rather more his own master  in speaking of his past life which, in comparison with what was happening to  him at that moment, interested him so little. His attention was wholly  concentrated on the manner in which his visit was to end. 'You must leave me,'  she kept on telling him, in a curt tone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>对那封寄来五百法郎的信做出许多推测之后，于连又继续说下去。他讲到过去的生活，变得稍稍能控制自己了，与眼下发生的事相比，那生活已引不起他多少兴趣。他的注意力完全在这次拜访将如何结束。“您快走吧，”人家总是时不时这样跟他说，口气也很生硬。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  a disgrace for me if I am shown the door! The remorse will be enough to poison  my whole life,' he said to himself, 'she will never write to me. God knows when  I shall return to this place!' From that moment, all the element of heavenly  bliss in Julien's situation vanished rapidly from his heart. Seated by the side  of a woman whom he adored, clasping her almost in his arms, in this room in  which he had been so happy, plunged in a black darkness, perfectly well aware  that for the last minute she had been crying, feeling, from the movement of her  bosom, that she was convulsed with sobs, he unfortunately became a frigid  politician, almost as calculating and as frigid as when, in the courtyard of  the Seminary, he saw himself made the butt of some malicious joke by one of his  companions stronger than himself. Julien spun out his story, and spoke of the  wretched life he had led since leaving Verrieres. 'And so,' Madame de Renal  said to herself, 'after a year's absence, almost without a single token of  remembrance, while I was forgetting him, his mind was entirely taken up with  the happy days he had enjoyed at Vergy.' Her sobs increased in violence. Julien  saw that his story had been successful. He realised that he must now try his  last weapon: he came abruptly to the letter that he had just received from  Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我要是被赶走，那对我是多大的耻辱啊！那将是毒害我一生的悔恨，”他想，“她永不会给我写信了。谁知道我何时再回到这个地方！”从这个时候起，于连当时的处境所能有的无比美妙的东西迅速从他心中消失。坐在心爱的女人身边，几乎是把她抱紧在臂弯里，在这个他曾经是那么幸福的卧室里，在沉沉黑夜之中，清楚地知道她一直在哭，感觉到她抽泣时胸脯的起伏，于连不幸一变而为一个冷冰冰的政治家，几乎像在神学院的院子里他成为一个比他强壮的同学恶意玩笑的对象时，一样地精心盘算，一样地沉着冷静。于连让他的讲述拖下去，又谈起他离开维里埃以后的不幸生活。“这么说，”德·莱纳夫人想，“分别了一年，几乎没有任何还被怀念的表示，他却只想着在韦尔吉度过的那些幸福的日子，可我却把他忘了。”她抽泣得更厉害了。于连看到他的话取得了成功。他知道他该试试最后一招了：他突然谈起他刚刚收到的巴黎来信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  have taken leave of Monseigneur, the Bishop.'</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'Yes,'  replied Julien, in a resolute tone; 'yes, I am abandoning the place where I am  forgotten even by her whom I have most dearly loved in all my life, and I am  leaving it never to set eyes on it again. I am going to Paris … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，”于连坚决地说，“是的，我要离开这个连我一生最爱的女人都把我忘记的地方，我要离开它，永远不再见到它。我要上巴黎…  …”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are going to Paris!' Madame de Renal exclaimed quite aloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你要上巴黎！”德·莱纳夫人叫道，声音相当高。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Her  voice was almost stifled by her tears, and showed the intensity of her grief.  Julien had need of this encouragement; he was going to attempt a course which  might decide everything against him; and before this exclamation, seeing no  light, he was absolutely ignorant of the effect that he was producing. He  hesitated no longer; the fear of remorse gave him complete command of himself;  he added coldly as he rose to his feet:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她的声音几乎被眼泪噎住，极端的慌乱暴露无遗。于连需要这种鼓励：他正要采取一个可能对他极为不利的举动；在这一惊呼之前，他什  么也看不出来；完全不知道会有什么结果。他不再犹豫，对后果的恐惧使他完全地控制了自己；他站起来，冷冰冰地说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  Madame, I leave you for ever, may you be happy; farewell.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，夫人，我要永远地离开您了，祝您幸福，永别了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>He  took a few steps towards the window; he was already opening it.Madame  de Renal sprang after him and flung herself into his arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他朝窗户走了几步，他已在开窗。德·莱纳夫人一跃而起，投入他的怀抱。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Thus,  after three hours of conversation, Julien obtained what he had so passionately  desired during the first two. Had they come a little earlier, this return to  tender sentiments, the eclipse of remorse in Madame de Renal would have been a  divine happiness; obtained thus by artifice, they were no more than mere  pleasure. Julien positively insisted, against the entreaties of his mistress,  upon lighting the nightlight.</p>

<div class="right">
<p>就这样，经过三个钟头的对话，于连得到了他头两个钟头里热切盼望得到的东西。恢复了温柔的感情，德·莱纳夫人的悔恨也消失了，若  是稍微早—些，那可能是一种无上的幸福，然而似这般通过手段才得到，那就只能是一种快乐了。于连不顾情人的坚持，一定要点亮那盏守夜灯。</p>

<p>'Do  you then wish me,' he asked her, 'to retain no memory of having seen you? The  love that is doubtless glowing in those charming eyes, shall it then be lost to  me? Shall the whiteness of that lovely hand be invisible to me? Think that I am  leaving you for a very long time perhaps!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您想不给我留一点见到您的回忆吗？”他对她说，“这双迷人的眼睛中肯定存在的爱情难道对我来说已经消失？这双美丽白皙的手难道不让我看见？想想吧，我可能离开您很久呀！”</p>

</div></div>

<p>Madame  de Renal could refuse nothing in the face of this idea which made her dissolve  in tears. Dawn was beginning to paint in clear hues the outline of the fir  trees on the mountain to the least of Verrieres. In stead of going away,  Julien, intoxicated with pleasure, asked Madame de Renal to let him spend the whole  day hidden in her room, and not to leave until the following night.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>听到这话，德·莱纳夫人已哭成个泪人儿，想想就什么也不能拒绝他了。然而，黎明已开始清晰地画出维里埃东部山上纵树林的轮廓。于连还不走，他陶醉在欢乐之中，求德·莱纳夫人让他藏在屋子里过上一整天，然后夜里再走。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  why not?' was her answer. 'This fatal relapse destroys all my self-esteem, and  dooms me to lifelong misery,' and she pressed him to her heart. 'My husband is  no longer the same, he has suspicions; he believes that I have been fooling him  throughout this affair, and is in the worst of tempers with me. If he hears the  least sound I am lost, he will drive me from the house like the wretch that I  am.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为什么不？”她答道。“这命中注定的第二次堕落已剥夺了我对自己的全部尊重，永远地铸成我的不幸。”她把他紧紧地抱在心上。“我丈夫跟从前大不一样了，他起了疑心；他认为我在整个这件事里把他耍得团团转，对我动不动就发火。他只要听见一点声音，我就完了，他会像赶走一个坏女人那样把我赶走，我可也是个坏女人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  There I can hear the voice of M. Chelan,' said Julien; you would not have  spoken to me like that before my cruel departure for the Seminary; you loved me  then!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！瞧瞧，谢朗先生的语言，”于连说；“在那次去神学院的残酷的别离之前，你不会这样跟我说话的，那时候你爱我！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was rewarded for the coolness with which he had uttered this speech; he saw his  mistress at once forget the danger in which the proximity of her husband  involved her, to think of the far greater danger of seeing Julien doubtful of  her love for him. The daylight was rapidly increasing and now flooded the room;  Julien recovered all the exquisite sensations of pride when he was once more  able to see in his arms and almost at his feet this charming woman, the only  woman that he had ever loved, who, a few hours earlier, had been entirely  wrapped up in the fear of a terrible God and in devotion to duty. Resolutions  fortified by a year of constancy had not been able to hold out against his  boldness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的话说得很冷静，他得到了补偿，他看见他的情人很快忘记了丈夫的在场会给她带来的危险，一心只想着于连怀疑她的爱情这个大得  多的危险。白天来得很快，把房间照得通亮；于连又可以看见这个迷人的女人偶依在他的怀里甚至几乎就在他的脚边，他又找回了自尊心得到满足的全部快乐，这个他唯一爱过的女人，几个钟头之前还整个儿沉湎在对那个可怕的天主的恐惧之中，沉湎在对自己的职责的热爱之中。一年坚持不懈的努力加强了她的种种决心，却未能在于连的勇气面前顶住。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Presently  they heard a sound in the house; a consideration to which she had not given a  thought now disturbed Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>很快，他们听见房子里有了响动；有一件事德·莱纳夫人没有想到，使她慌乱起来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  wicked Elisa will be coming into the room, what are we to do with that enormous  ladder?' she said to her lover; 'where are we to hide it? I am going to take it  up to the loft,' she suddenly exclaimed, with a sort of playfulness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那个可恶的爱丽莎要到这间屋子里来了，梯子这么大，怎么办？”她对她的情人说；“把它藏在哪儿呢？我去把它搬到顶楼上吧，”她  突然叫道，那种活泼劲儿又上来了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  you will have to go through the servant's room,' said Julien with astonishment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不过那得经过仆人住的屋子呀，”于连惊讶地说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  shall leave the ladder in the corridor, call the man and send him on an  errand.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我把梯子放在走廊上，把仆人叫来，让他去办。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Remember  to have some excuse ready in case the man notices the ladder when he passes it  in the passage.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你得想好一句话，仆人经过时看见走廊上有梯子，会引起注意的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  my angel,' said Madame de Renal as she gave him a kiss. 'And you, remember to  hide yourself quickly under the bed if Elisa comes into the room while I am  away.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，我的天使，”德·莱纳夫人说，一边吻了他一下。“你呢，得赶快躲到床底下去，我不在的时候，爱丽莎会进来的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was amazed at this sudden gaiety. 'And so,' he thought, 'the approach of  physical danger, so far from disturbing her, restores her gaiety because she  forgets her remorse! Indeed a superior woman! Ah! There is a heart in which it  is glorious to reign!' Julien was in ecstasies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连对她这种突如其来的快乐感到惊奇。“后来，”他想，“一种实际的危险临近了，慰未使她慌乱，反而使她快活起来，这是因为她已  忘了悔恨！的确是个出类拔萃的女人！啊！赢得一颗这样的心才真叫光荣：“于连高兴极了。</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal took the ladder; plainly it was too heavy for her.Julien  went to her assistance; he was admiring that elegant figure, which suggested  anything rather than strength, when suddenly, without help, she grasped the  ladder and picked it up as she might have picked up a chair. She carried it  swiftly to the corridor on the third storey, where she laid it down by the  wall. She called the manservant, and, to give him time to put on his clothes,  went up to the dovecote. Five minutes later, when she returned to the corridor,  the ladder was no more to be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人去搬梯子，显然是太沉了。于连去帮她，果然是一副优美的好身材，看上去那么柔弱无力，谁知突然间，她不用帮忙，一把抓住梯子，像一把椅子似地举了起来。她迅速将梯子搬至四层的走廊上，顺墙放倒。她叫仆人，趁他穿衣的工夫，登上鸽楼。五分钟以后，她回到走廊上，梯子已不见了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>What  had become of it? Had Julien been out of the house, the danger would have been  nothing. But, at that moment, if her husband saw the ladder! The consequences  might be appalling. Madame de Renal ran up and down the house. At last she  discovered the ladder under the roof, where the man had taken it and in fact  hidden it himself. This in itself was strange, and at another time would have  alarmed her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>梯子哪儿去了？假使于连已离开这房子，这种危险不大会把她怎么样。然而，这个时候，如果她丈夫看见了梯子！这件事可就糟透了。德·莱纳夫人到处都跑遍了。最后，她在屋顶下发现了那梯子，是仆人搬上去藏好的。这种情况很特别，若在过去，会让她惊恐不安的。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  does it matter to me,' she thought, 'what may happen in twenty four hours from  now, when Julien will have gone? Will not everything then be to me horror and  remorse?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“管它呢，”她想，“二十四小时以后可能发生的事有什么关系？于连已经走了。到那时候，对我来说一切不都是恐惧和悔恨吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  had a sort of vague idea that she ought to take her life, but what did that  matter? After a parting which she had supposed to be for ever, he was restored  to her, she saw him again, and what he had done in making his way to her gave  proof of such a wealth of love!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她模模糊糊地想到，该结束生命了，可那又有什么关系！她以为是永别了，可是后来他又被还给了她，她又看见他了，而且他为了来到她  身边所做的那些事表现出多少爱情啊！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  telling Julien of the incident of the ladder:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她对于连讲了梯子的事，说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  shall I say to my husband,' she asked him, 'if the man tells him how he found  the ladder?' She meditated for a moment. 'It will take them twenty-four hours  to discover the peasant who sold it to you'; and flinging herself into Julien's  arms and clasping him in a convulsive embrace: 'Ah! to die, to die like this!'  she cried as she covered him with kisses; ????? 'but  I must not let you die of hunger,' she added with a laugh.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果仆人对我丈夫说他发现了这梯子，我回答他些什么呢？”她沉思了片刻；“他们得花二十四个钟头才能找到把梯子卖给你的那个农  民，”她扑进于连的怀里，痉挛般地抱紧他：“啊！死吧，就这样死吧！”她一边叫，一边频频吻他，“但是不应该把你饿死，”她笑着说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Come;  first of all, I am going to hide you in Madame Derville's room, which is always  kept locked.' She kept watch at the end of the corridor and Julien slipped from  door to door. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“来，我先把你藏在德尔维夫人的房间里，这房间一直锁着。”她走到走廊一头查看了一番，于连跑了过去。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Remember not to answer, if any one knocks,' she reminded him as  she turned the key outside; 'anyhow, it would only be the children playing.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“如果有人敲门，千万别开，”她一边把他镇在屋里，一边说；“总之，这不过是孩子们在玩要时开的一个玩笑。”</p>

</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Make  them go into the garden, below the window,' said Julien, 'so that I may have  the pleasure of seeing them, make them speak.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“让他们到花园里去，在窗户底下，”于连说，“让我看见他们高兴高兴，让他们说说话吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  yes,' cried Madame de Renal as she left him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“对、对，”德·莱纳夫人叫道，离去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  returned presently with oranges, biscuits, a bottle of Malaga; she had found it  impossible to purloin any bread.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她很快就回来了，拿来些柑子、饼干和一瓶马拉加酒，只是没偷着面包。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  is your husband doing?' said Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你丈夫在干什么？”于连问，</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  is writing down notes of the deals he proposes to do with some peasants.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他在写与农民做生意的计划。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  eight o'clock had struck, the house was full of noise. If Madame de Renal were  not to be seen, people would begin searching everywhere for her; she was  obliged to leave him. Presently she returned, in defiance of all the rules of  prudence, to bring him a cup of coffee; she was afraid of his dying of hunger.  After luncheon she managed to shepherd the children underneath the window of  Madame Derville's room. He found that they had grown considerably, but they had  acquired a common air, or else his ideas had changed. Madame de Renal spoke to  them of Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>八点的钟声响了，房子里的声音很大。要是看不见德·莱纳夫人，他们就会到处找她；她不能不离开他。很快她又冒冒失失地回来，端来  一杯咖啡；她生怕他饿坏了。午饭以后，她设法把孩子们带到德尔维夫人的房间的窗下。他发现他们长高许多，不过他们的样子变得很平庸，也许是他的看法改变了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  eldest replied with affection and regret for his former tutor, but it appeared  that the two younger had almost forgotten him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人跟他们谈于连。老大的回答还有对过去的家庭教师的友情和怀念，可两个小的已差不多把他忘了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Renal did not leave the house that morning; he was incessantly going up and  downstairs, engaged in striking bargains with certain peasants, to whom he was  selling his potato crop. Until dinner time, Madame de Renal had not a moment to  spare for her prisoner. When dinner was on the table, it occurred to her to  steal a plateful of hot soup for him. As she silently approached the door of  the room in which he was, carrying the plate carefully, she found herself face  to face with the servant who had hidden the ladder that morning. At that  moment, he too was coming silently along the corridor, as though listening.  Probably Julien had forgotten to tread softly. The servant made off in some  confusion. Madame de Renal went boldly into Julien's room; her account of the  incident made him shudder.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳先生上午没出去，他在房子里上上下下，忙着和农民们做生意，他卖给他们土豆。直到吃饭的时候，德·莱纳夫人没有给她的囚  犯片刻工夫。晚饭的铃声响了，摆好了，她想为他偷一盘热汤。她正无声无息地走近于连的那间屋子，小心翼翼地端着那盘汤，迎面碰上了那个早上藏梯子的仆人。这时，他也无声无息地在过道里走，仿佛在听什么。也许于连走动时不小心。仆人走远了，有些摸不着头脑。德·莱纳夫人大胆地进了屋子，于连见她进来，不禁打了个哆嗦。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are afraid'; she said to him; 'and I, I would brave all the dangers in the  world without a tremor. I fear one thing only, that is the moment when I shall  be left alone after you have gone,' and she ran from the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你怕了，”她对他说；“我嘛，我可以蔑视世界上任何危险，眉头都不皱一皱。我只害怕一件事，就是你走后我将一个人苦度时光，”她跑着离开了他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!'  thought Julien, greatly excited, 'remorse is the only danger that sublime soul  dreads!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！”于连激动不已，自言自语道，“悔恨是这颗崇高的灵魂所害怕的唯一危险：”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Night  came at last. M. de Renal went to the Casino.His  wife had announced a severe headache, she retired to her room, made haste to  dismiss Elisa, and speedily rose from her bed to open the door to Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>终于到了晚上，德·莱纳先生去俱乐部了。他妻子早就说偏头痛得厉害，也回房了，急忙打发走爱丽莎，很快又起来去给于连开门。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  so happened that he really was faint with hunger. Madame de Renal went to the  pantry to look for bread. Julien heard a loud cry. She returned and told him  that on entering the dark pantry, making her way to a cupboard in which the  bread was kept, and stretching out her hand, she had touched a woman's arm. It  was Elisa who had uttered the cry which Julien had heard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连果然饿得要死。德·莱纳夫人去配餐间找面包。于连听见一声大叫。德·莱纳夫人回来了，跟于连说，她进入没有点灯的配餐间，走  近一个放面包的碗橱，一伸手，却碰在一个女人的胳膊上，那是爱丽莎，于连听见的那声大叫就是她发出的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  was she doing there?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她在那儿干什么？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She  was stealing a few sweetmeats, or possibly spying on us,' said Madame de Renal  with complete indifference. 'But fortunately I have found a pate and a big  loaf.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“偷糖或者监视我们，”德·莱纳夫人毫不在乎地说。“还好，我找到了一块馅饼和一个大面包。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  what have you got there?' said Julien, pointing to the pockets of her apron.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那儿是什么？”干连问，指着她围裙上的口袋。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal had forgotten that, ever since dinner, they had been filled with  bread.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人忘了，从吃晚饭的时候起，那些口袋里全都装满了面包。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  clasped her in his arms with the keenest passion; never had she seemed to him  so beautiful. 'Even in Paris,' he told himself vaguely, 'I shall not be able to  find a nobler character.' She had all the awkwardness of a woman little  accustomed to attentions of this sort, and at the same time the true courage of  a person who fears only dangers of another kind and far more terrible.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连怀着最强烈的热情把她紧紧抱在怀里，觉得她从未这样美丽过。“就是在巴黎，”他惭愧地暗想，“我也不能遇见更伟大的个性了。  ”她有着一个不惯于此类体贴的女人的全部笨拙，同时又有着一个只害怕另一种性质的更为可怕的危险的人的真正勇气。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While  Julien was devouring his supper with a keen appetite, and his mistress was  playfully apologising for the simplicity of the repast, for she had a horror of  serious speech, the door of the room was all at once shaken violently. It was  M. de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连津津有味地吃着晚饭，他的情人就饭食的简单跟他开玩笑，因为她害怕一本正经地说话。这时，突然有人使劲摇晃房门。是德·莱纳先生来了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why  have you locked yourself in?' he shouted to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“你为什么把自己关起来？”他对她喊道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had just time to slip beneath the sofa.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连只来得及钻到沙发底下。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  You are fully dressed,' said M. de Renal, as he entered; 'you are having  supper, and you have locked your door?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！您的衣服还穿得整整齐齐的？”德·莱纳先生说着进了门；“您在吃晚饭，您还把门上了锁！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  any ordinary day, this question, put with all the brutality of a husband, would  have troubled Madame de Renal, but she felt that her husband had only to lower  his eyes a little to catch sight of Julien; for M. de Renal had flung himself  upon the chair on which Julien had been sitting a moment earlier, facing the  sofa.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>若是在平时，这个用夫妻间极冷淡的口吻提出的问题，会使德·莱纳夫人惊慌失措，然而她觉得她丈夫只要弯一弯腰就能看见于连；因为  德·莱纳先生一屁股坐在于连刚坐过的那把椅子上，正对着沙发。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Her  headache served as an excuse for everything. While in his turn her husband was  giving her a long and detailed account of the pool he had won in the billiard  room of the Casino, 'a pool of nineteen francs, begad!'he  added, she saw lying on a chair before their eyes, and within a few feet of  them, Julien's hat. Cooler than ever, she began to undress, and, choosing her  moment, passed swiftly behind her husband and flung a garment over the chair  with the hat on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她把这一切都推在偏头疼上。她的丈夫也开始向她详细地讲述他在“夜总会”玩台球赢了全部赌注的情况，“十九个法郎的赌注啊，真的！”他补充道，她瞥见了于连的帽子，正在他们前面三步远的一把椅子上。她更加冷静，开始宽衣，过了一会儿，迅速从她丈夫身后走过去，随手把一件连衣裙扔在那把放帽子的椅子上。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  length M. de Renal left her. She begged Julien to begin over again the story of  his life in the Seminary: 'Yesterday I was not listening to you, I was  thinking, while you were speaking, only of how I was to bring myself to send  you away.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生终于走了。她求于连接着讲他在神学院的生活；“昨天我没听你说，你说话的时候，我只想着如何迫使自己把你打发走。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  was the embodiment of imprudence. They spoke very loud; and it might have been  two o'clock in the morning when they were interrupted by a violent blow on the  door. It was M. de Renal again:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她真是不谨慎到了极点。他们说话声音太高；大概早晨两点钟，突然一下猛烈的敲门声打断了他们的谈话。又是德·莱纳先生。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Let  me in at once, there are burglars in the house!' he said, 'Saint Jean found  their ladder this morning.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“快开门，家里有贼！”他说，圣让今天早上发现了他们的梯子。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  is the end of everything,' cried Madame de Renal, throwing herself into  Julien's arms. 'He is going to kill us both, he does not believe in the  burglars; I am going to die in your arms, more fortunate in my death than I  have been in my life.' She made no answer to her husband, who was waiting  angrily outside, she was holding Julien in a passionate embrace.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“现在一切都完了，”德·莱纳夫人喊道，投入于连的怀抱。“他要把我们两个都杀死，他不相信有贼；我要死在你的怀里，这样死比我  活着还幸福。”她不理她那大发雷重的丈夫，她热情地亲吻于连。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Save  Stanislas's mother,' he said to her with an air of command. 'I am going to jump  down into the courtyard from the window of the closet, and escape through the  garden, the dogs know me. Make a bundle of my clothes and throw it down into  the garden as soon as you can. Meanwhile, let him break the door in. And  whatever you do, no confession, I forbid it, suspicion is better than  certainty.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“救救斯坦尼斯拉的母亲，”他说，命令似地看着她。“我从小房间的窗户跳到院子里，然后逃进花园，狗还认得我。把我的衣服打成一个包，立刻扔进花园。你等着，让他们把门打破。特别是什么也不要承认，我不准你承认，让他怀疑总比让他确信要好。”</p>

<p>'You  will kill yourself, jumping down,' was her sole reply and her sole anxiety.</p>

<p>“你跳下去会摔死的！”这是她唯一的回答，唯一的担心。</p>

<p>She  went with him to the window of the closet; she then took such time as she  required to conceal his garments. Finally she opened the door to her husband,  who was boiling with rage. He searched the bedroom, the closet, without  uttering a word, and then vanished. Julien's clothes were thrown down to him,  he caught them and ran quickly down the garden towards the Doubs.As  he ran, he heard a bullet whistle past him, and simultaneously the sound of a  gun being fired.</p>

<p>她跟他一起走到小房间的窗前，然后她藏好他的衣服。最后她才给她暴跳如雷的丈夫开门。他在房间里看了又看，又到小房间里看了看，  一句话没说，走了，于连的衣服扔下去了，他一把抓住，飞快地朝杜河方向花园较低的一头跑去。他正跑着，听见一颗子弹呼啸而过，随即听见一声枪响。</p>

<p>'That  is not M. de Renal,' he decided, 'he is not a good enough shot.'</p>

<p>The  dogs were running by his side in silence, a second shot apparently shattered  the paw of one dog, for it began to emit lamentable howls. Julien jumped the  wall of a terrace, proceeded fifty yards under cover, then continued his flight  in a different direction. He heard voices calling, and could distinctly see the  servant, his enemy, fire a gun; a farmer also came and shot at him from the  other side of the garden, but by this time Julien had reached the bank of the Doubs,  where he put on his clothes.</p>

<p>几条狗在身旁奔跑，也不叫，又是一枪，看来打断了一条狗的爪子，因为它嗷嗷地惨叫起来。于连跳过一块公地的围墙，隐蔽地跑了五十步，然后朝另一个方向逃去。他听见互相吃喝的人声，清清楚楚地看见了那个仆人，也就是他的敌人，打了一枪；一个佃户从花园的另一头射击，然而于连已到了杜河岸，穿上了衣服。</p>

<p>An  hour later, he was a league from Verrieres, on the road to Geneva.'If  there is any suspicion,' thought Julien, 'it is on the Paris road that they  will look for me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一个钟头以后，他已离维里埃一法里远了，上了去日内瓦的大路；“如果有人起疑，”于连想，“他们会到去巴黎的大路上追我。”</p>
