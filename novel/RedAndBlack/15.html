  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>If Julien had had a little of that discernment which  he so gratuitously supposed himself to possess, he might have congratulated  himself next day on the effect produced by his visit to Verrieres. His absence  had caused his clumsiness to be forgotten. All that day too, he was inclined to  sulk; towards nightfall a preposterous idea  occurred to him, and he imparted it to Madame de Renal with a rare intrepidity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连动辄以为自己很聪明，他若有点儿的话，第二天就会庆幸维里埃之行所产生的效果了。他的不在使人忘记了他的笨拙。这一天他依然相当地不快。快到晚上的时候，他突然有了个可笑的念头，并且以少有的大胆告诉了德·莱纳夫人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>No sooner had they sat down in the garden  than, without waiting for a sufficient cloak of darkness, Julien put his lips  to Madame de Renal's ear,and, at the risk of compromising her horribly, said to  her:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>大家刚在花园里坐定，于连不等天完全黑下来，就把嘴凑近德·莱纳夫人的耳朵，冒着使她的名誉大受损害的风险，对她说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Tonight, Ma'am, at two o'clock, I am coming  to your room, I have something to say to you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“夫人，夜里两点钟，我要到您的房里去，有件事我得跟您说。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien was trembling lest his request should  be granted; the part of a seducer was so horrible a burden that if he had been  free to follow his own inclination, he would have retired to his room for some  days, and not set eyes on the ladies again. He realised that, by his clever  tactics of yesterday, he had squandered all  the promise of the day before, and really he did not know where to turn.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连发抖了，生怕他的请求被接受；这诱惑者的角色压得他好苦，他若由着自己的性子，会躲进房里几天不出来，不再见这两位太太。他知道，他昨天的精心谋划的举动已将前一天的美好形象破坏殆尽，他确实不知道该求哪一位圣者了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame de Renal  replied with a genuine and by no means exaggerated indignation to the  impertinent announcement which Julien had had the audacity to make. He thought  he could read scorn in her brief answer. It was certain that in this answer,  uttered in the lowest of tones, the word 'Fie!' had figured. Making the excuse  that he had something to say to the children, Julien went up to their room, and  on his return placed himself by the side of Madame Derville and at a distance  from Madame de Renal. He thus removed from himself all possibility of taking  her hand. The conversation took a serious turn, and Julien held his own  admirably, apart from a few intervals of silence during which he cudgeled his  brains. 'Why cannot I think of some fine plan,' he asked himself, 'to force  Madame de Renal to show me those unmistakable marks of affecttion which made me  imagine, three days ago, that she was mine!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人怀着真实的、绝非夸大的愤怒回答了于连胆敢向她提出的无礼请求。他相信在她简短的回答中看出了轻蔑。他确信在她的声音很低的回答中出现了“呸”这个字。于连借口有事对孩子们说，就到他们的房间去了，回来时坐在了德尔维夫人旁边，离开德·莱纳夫人远远的。这样他就避开了握住她的手的任何可能。谈话很严肃，于连应付得很好，只有过几次短暂的沉默，那当儿他正搅脑汁呢。“我就不能想出什么好办法，”他心里说，“迫使德·莱纳夫人重新自我作出明确的温柔表示！三天以前，正是那些表示让我相信她是属于我的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien was extremely disconcerted by the  almost desperate situation into which he had been led. And yet nothing could  have embarrassed him so much as success.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连把事情弄到近乎绝望的地步，心里乱到了极点。不过，最使他狼狈不堪的，倒可能是成功呢。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When the party broke up at midnight, his  pessimism led him to believe that Madame Derville looked upon him with  contempt, and that probably he stood no higher in the favour of Madame de  Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>半夜分手时，他的悲观使他相信，他从德尔维夫人那里得到的是轻蔑，大概德·莱纳夫人对他也好不了多少。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Being in an extremely bad temper and deeply  humiliated, Julien could not sleep. He was a thousand leagues from any thought  of abandoning all pretence, all his plans, and of living from day to day with  Madame de Renal, contenting himself like a child with the happiness that each  day would bring.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连睡不着，他的心情很坏，而且感到屈辱。他根本就不想放弃一切伪装、一切计划，不想跟德·莱纳夫人日复一日地过下去，像孩子那样满足于每天可能带来的幸福。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He wearied his brain in devising clever  stratagems; a moment later, he felt them to be absurd; he was in short  extremely wretched, when two struck from the clock tower.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他累得脑袋疼，想出种种巧妙的伎俩，转眼间又觉得全都荒唐可笑；一句话，他很不幸，这时，城堡的钟敲了两下。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This sound aroused him as the crow of the  cock aroused Saint Peter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这声音惊醒他，就像鸡叫惊醒了圣徒彼得。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He saw himself arrived at the moment of the  most distressing event. He had not thought once again of his impertinent  suggestion, from the moment in which he had made it. It had met with so hostile  a reception!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他看见自己正处在发生最难承受的大事的时刻。自从他提出那个无礼的请求之后，他就不再想它了，它受到了那样坏地对待！</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I told her that I should come to her at two  o'clock,' he said to himself as he rose; 'I may be inexperienced and coarse, as  is natural in the son of a peasant, Madame Derville has let me see that plainly  enough; but at any rate I will not be weak.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我对她说过我两点钟去她那里，”他一边起身一边对自己说，“我可以没有经验，粗鲁，一个农民的儿子本该如此，德尔维夫人已经让我听出这意思了，但是至少我可以不软弱。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien had every right to praise his own  courage, never had he set himself a more painful task. As he opened the door of  his room, he trembled so much that his knees gave way beneath him, and he was  obliged to lean against the wall.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连说得对，他可以为他的勇气而自得，他还从不曾这样艰难地强制过自己。他打开门，抖得厉害，两腿直发软；他强使自己靠在墙上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He was in his stockinged feet. He went to  listen at M. de Renal's door,through which he could hear him snoring. This  dismayed him. He had no longer any excuse for not going to her. But, great God!  What should he do when he got there? He had no plan, and even if he had had  one, he was in such distress of mind that he would not have been in a fit state  to put it into practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他没有穿鞋。他走到德·莱纳先生的门前，听了听，鼾声依稀可闻。他大失所望。他没有借口了，不能不到她那里去了。可是，伟大的天主，他去那儿干什么？他什么计划也没有，即便有，他觉得心绪这样慌乱，也无法依计而行。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Finally, with an anguish a thousand times  keener than if he had been going to the scaffold, he entered the little  corridor that led to Madame de Renal's room. He opened the door with a  trembling hand, making a fearful noise as he did so.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>终于，他忍受着比赴死还要大一千倍的痛苦，进入通往德·莱纳夫人房间的那条小过道。他伸出颤抖的手推开门，弄出了可怕的响声。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There was a light in the room, a night light  was burning in the fire place; he had not expected this fresh calamity. Seeing  him enter, Madame de Renal sprang quickly out of bed. 'Wretch!' she cried.  There was some confusion. Julien forgot his futile plans and returned to his  own natural character. Not to please so charming a woman seemed to him the greatest  disaster possible. His only answer to her reproaches was to fling himself at  her feet, clasping her round the knees. As she spoke to him with extreme  harshness, he burst into tears.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>屋里有亮，壁炉下点着一些通宵不灭的灯；他没有料到这个新的不幸。德·莱纳夫人看见他进来，猛地跳下床。“疯子！”她喊道。乱了一阵。于连己经忘了他那些没有用的计划，恢复了本来的面目；讨不得一个如此迷人的女人欢心，在他看来，乃是不幸中最大的不幸。他对她的指责的回答，只是跪在她脚下，抱住她的双膝。她的话说得极其严厉，他哭了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Some hours later, when Julien emerged from  Madame de Renal's room, one might have said, in the language of romance, that  there was nothing more left for him to wish. And indeed, he was indebted to the  love he had inspired and to the unforeseen impression made on him by her  seductive charms for a victory to which not all his misplaced ingenuity would  ever have led him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>几个钟头之后，当于连走出德·莱纳夫人的卧房时，我们可以用小说笔法说，他已别无所求了，事实上，靠他那一套拙劣的机巧得不到的胜利，他却靠他所激起的爱情和迷人的魅力在他身上引起的意想不到的影响而得到了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But, in the most delicious moments, the  victim of a freakish pride,  he still attempted to play the part of a man in the habit of captivating women:  he made incredible efforts to destroy his natural amiability. Instead of his  paying attention to the transports which he excited, and to the remorse that  increased their vivacity, the idea of duty was continually before his eyes. He  feared a terrible remorse, and undying ridicule, should he depart from the  ideal plan that he had set himself to follow. In a word, what made Julien a  superior being was precisely what prevented him from enjoying the happiness  that sprang up at his feet. He was like a girl of sixteen who has a charming  complexion and, before going to a ball, is foolish enough to put on rouge.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而，在那最温柔的时刻，他却成了一种奇怪的骄傲的牺牲品，他竟还想扮演一个风月老手的角色。他竭尽全力破坏自己的可爱之处，真令人难以置信。他不去注意他激起的狂喜，也不去注意使狂喜变得更加强烈的悔恨，反而始终让责任的观念在眼前出现。他害怕一旦离开他打算效法的理想模式，他就会陷入痛苦的悔恨之中，成为永远的笑柄。一句话，使于连出类拔萃的那种东西恰恰使他不能享受就在他脚下的幸福。譬如一位十六岁的少女，颜色本来娇艳可人，为了去参加舞会，却愚蠢地搽上了胭脂。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In mortal terror at the apparition of  Julien, Madame de Renal was soon a prey to the cruellest alarms. Julien's tears  and despair distressed her greatly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的出现把德·莱纳夫人吓得要死，很快最残酷的不安又来折磨她。于连的哭泣和绝望使她六神无主了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Indeed, when she had no longer anything to  refuse him, she thrust him from her, with genuine indignation, and then flung  herself into his arms. No purpose was apparent in all this behaviour. She  thought herself damned without remission, and  sought to shut out the vision of hell by showering the most passionate caresses  on Julien. In a word, nothing would have been wanting to complete our hero's  happiness, not even a burning sensibility in the woman he had just vanquished,  had he been capable of enjoying it. Julien's departure brought no cessation of  the transports which were shaking her in spite of herself, nor of her struggle with  the remorse that was tearing her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>甚至在她已没有什么可以拒绝于连的时候，她仍怀着真正的愤怒把他推得远远地，然后又投入他的怀抱。这中间并没有任何的做作。她相信自己已被罚入地狱，万劫不复，她试图回避地狱的景象，就百般地温存爱抚于连。一句话，只要我们的主人公知道加何享用，他的幸福是不缺什么了，甚至他刚刚征服的女人身上的那种灼人的感觉。于连走了，可那股狂喜还使她兴奋得不能自己，那与悔恨的搏斗还在撕扯着她的心。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Heavens! Is to be happy, to be loved, no  more than that?' Such was Julien's first thought on his return to his own room.  He was in that state of astonishment and uneasy misgivings into which a heart  falls when it has just obtained what it has long desired. It has grown used to  desiring,finds nothing left to desire, and has not yet acquired any memories.  Like a soldier returning from a parade, Julien was busily engaged in reviewing  all the details of his conduct. '</p>

<p>Have I failed in one of the duties I owe to  myself? Have I really played my part?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的主啊，幸福，被爱，就是这？”这是于连回到房间后的第一个想法。于连处在一种惊奇和惶惑不安的状态中，一个人刚刚得到他长久渴望的东西，就会陷入这种状态。他习惯于渴望，现在却没有什么要渴望的了，不过他眼下还没有回忆。于连像一个参加检阅归来的士兵，聚精会神地把他的行为细细地检查一遍。</p>
<p>“我对我的责任完全尽到了吗？我的角色扮演得好吗？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And what a part! The part of a man accustomed  to shine before women.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>什么角色？一个惯于引女人注目的男人的角色。   </p>
</div></div>
