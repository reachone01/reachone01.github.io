  <div class="right3">于连出走</div>
</div>
 
 
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">


<p>'I will  not play that poor abbe Chas Bernard the unkind trick of sending for him,' he  said to Fouque; 'he would not be able to eat his dinner for three days  afterwards. But try to find me a Jansenist, a friend of M. Pirard and beyond  the reach of intrigue.'</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“别让人把可怜的夏斯一贝尔纳神甫叫来，我不想要这种恶作剧，”他对富凯说；“他会三天吃不下饭的。设法给我找一位詹森派教士，彼拉神甫的朋友，不搞阴谋诡计的。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Fouque  had been awaiting this development with impatience. Julien acquitted himself in  a decent fashion of everything that is due to public opinion in the provinces.  Thanks to M. l'abbe de Frilair, and in spite of his unfortunate choice of a  confessor, Julien, in his cell, was under the protection of the Congregation;  with a little more of the spirit of action, he might have made his escape. But,  as the bad air of the cell produced its effect, his mental powers dwindled.  This made him all the happier on the return of Madame de Renal.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>富凯正焦急地等着他开口呢。凡是外省舆论所要求的种种，于连都做得很得体。尽管忏悔神甫选得不当，但有德·福利莱神甫暗中帮忙，于连在牢里还是受到了圣会的保护；他若是机灵些，是可以逃出去的。但是牢里的恶劣空气起了作用，他的智力减退了。这使他在德·莱纳夫人回来时感到更加幸福。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'My  first duty is towards you,' she said to him as she embraced him; 'I have fled  from Verrieres … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的责任首先是为了你，”她一边说，一边吻他，“我从维里埃逃出来了……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had no petty vanity in his relations with her, he told her of all his weak  moments. She was kind and charming to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连对她没有一丁点儿无谓的自尊心，把他的种种软弱合盘托出。她对他既温柔又可爱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  evening, immediately upon leaving the prison, she summoned to her aunt's house  the priest who had attached himself to Julien as to a prey; as he wished only  to acquire a reputation among the young women belonging to the best society of  Besancon, Madame de Renal easily persuaded him to go and offer a novena at the  abbey of BrayleHaut.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上，她一走出监狱，就让人把像抓住猎物一样抓住于连不放的年轻教士叫到她姑妈家；由于他只是想在贝藏松的上流社会的年轻女人中取得信任，德·莱纳夫人很容易地说服他去博雷一勒欧修道院做一次九日祈祷。</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>No  words could express the intensity and recklessness of Julien's love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的爱情之过度和疯狂远非语言可以形容。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By  spending money freely, and by using and abusing the reputation of her aunt,  well known for her piety and riches, Madame de Renal obtained permission to see  him twice daily.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>靠了金钱，利用并且滥用她姑妈，一个出了名的、富有的笃信宗教的女人的信誉，德·莱纳夫人获准每天两次探望他。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On  hearing this, Mathilde's jealousy rose to the pitch of insanity. M. de Frilair  had assured her that in spite of his position he dared not flout all the  conventions so far as to permit her to see her friend more than once daily.  Mathilde had Madame de Renal followed, so as to be kept informed of her most  trivial actions. M. de Frilair exhausted every resource of a most cunning mind,  in trying to prove to her that Julien was unworthy of her.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>听到这个消息，玛蒂尔德妒意大发，直至丧失理智。德·福利莱先生向她承认，他的势力还没有达到无视一切礼仪的程度，不能让人准她每日不止一次地去探望她的朋友。玛蒂尔德让人跟着德·莱纳夫人，好知道她的一举一动。德·福利莱德先生用尽了一非常灵活的头脑所能想出的一切办法，向她证明于连配不上她。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>In the  midst of all these torments, she loved him all the more, and, almost every day,  created a horrible scene in his cell.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经受着这种种痛苦的煎熬，她反而更爱他了，几乎每天都跟他大吵大闹。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  wished at all costs to behave like an honourable man until the end towards this  poor girl whom he had so seriously compromised; but,at every moment, the  unbridled passion that he felt for Madame de Renal overcame him. When, through  some flaw in his argument, he failed to convince Mathilde of the innocence of  her rival's visits: 'At this stage, the end of the play must be very near,' he  said to himself; 'that is some excuse for me if I cannot act better.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>对于这个他如此不寻常地连累了的可怜女孩子，于连想竭尽全力做个正直的人，一直到底；然而，他对德·莱纳夫人的狂热的爱情每时每刻都不放过他。他找出的理由站不住脚，不能说服玛蒂尔德相信德·莱纳夫人的探访是纯洁的，他就对自己说：“这出戏应该快要结束了，如果我掩饰不住我的感情，这倒是我的一个借口。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole learned of the death of M. de Croisenois. M. de Thaler, that man of  boundless wealth, had taken the liberty of saying unpleasant things about  Mathilde's disappearance; M. de Croisenois called on him with a request that he  would withdraw them: M. de Thaler showed him certain anonymous letters  addressed to himself, and full of details so skilfully put together that it was  impossible for the poor Marquis not to discern the true facts.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·拉莫尔小姐获悉德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生死了，德·塔莱先生，那个如此富有的人，竟敢对玛蒂尔德的失踪说了些难听的话，德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生前去请他收回。德·塔莱先生把一些写给他的匿名信拿给他看，信里充满了巧妙地串联起来的种种细节，可怜的侯爵不能不看到事实真相。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>M. de  Thaler indulged in pleasantries that were distinctly broad. Mad with rage and  misery, M. de Croisenois insisted upon reparations so drastic that the  millionaire preferred a duel. Folly proved triumphant;and one of the men in Paris  most worthy of a woman's love met his death in his twenty-fourth year.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·塔莱先生又斗胆开了几句不够委婉的玩笑。德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生怒不可遏，痛不欲生，提出的赔礼道歉的要求过于苛刻，百万富翁宁可进行决斗。愚蠢胜利了，巴黎那些最配人爱的人之一，还不满二十四岁，就这样死于非命。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>This  death made a strange and morbid impression on Julien'sweakened spirits.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>他的死在于连日渐衰弱的心灵上留下一种奇怪的，病态的印象。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"> <p>'Poor  Croisenois,' he said to Mathilde, 'did really behave quite reasonably and  honourably towards us; he had every right to hate me after your imprudent  behaviour in your mother's drawing-room, and to seek a quarrel with me; for the  hatred that follows on contempt is generally furious.'</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>“可怜的克鲁瓦泽努瓦，”他对玛蒂尔德说，“他对待我们的确是很通情达理，很诚实正直；您在您母亲的客厅里干出那些轻率的事情之后，他本应恨我，找我的麻烦，因为跟着轻蔑来的仇恨通常都是狂暴的……”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>The  death of M. de Croisenois altered all Julien's ideas with regard to Mathilde's  future; he devoted several days to proving to her that she ought to accept the  hand of M. de Luz. 'He is a shy man, not too much of a Jesuit,' he told her,  'and a man who no doubt intends to climb. With a more sober and persistent  ambition than poor Croisenois, and with no dukedom in his family, he will make  no difficulty about marrying Julien Sorel's widow.'</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生的死改变了于连关于玛蒂尔德的未来的一切想法；他用了几天工夫向她证明，她应该接受德·吕兹先生的求婚。“这个人腼腆，但是不过分伪善，”他对她说，“他肯定会加入求婚者的行列。比起可怜的克鲁瓦泽努瓦来，他的野心要平凡些，持久些，他家里没有公爵领地，娶于连·索莱尔的寡妇不会有任何困难。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'And a  widow who scorns grand passions,' replied Mathilde coldly;'for she has lived  long enough to see, after six months, her lover prefer another woman, and a  woman who was the origin of all their troubles.'</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>“而且是一个蔑视伟大的激情的寡妇，”玛蒂尔德冷冷地反唇相讥，“因为六个月的生活，已经足够让她看到，她的情人爱的不是她而是另一个女人，而这个女人正是他们一切不幸的根源。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'You  are unjust; Madame de Renal's visits will furnish the barrister from Paris, who  has been engaged to conduct my appeal, with some striking phrases; he will  describe the murderer honoured by the attentions of his victim. That may create  an effect, and perhaps one day you will see me the hero of some melodrama,'  etc., etc.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>“您这就不公正了，德·莱纳夫人的探视将向为我请求特赦的巴黎律师提供特殊的理由；他将描绘凶手如何受到受害者的关怀。这会产生效果的，也许有一天您会看到我成了一出情节剧的主角呢……”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>A  furious jealousy and one that was incapable of wreaking vengeance,the  prolongation of a hopeless misery (for, even supposing Julien to be saved, how  was she to recapture his heart?), the shame and grief of loving more than ever  this faithless lover, had plunged Mademoiselle de La Mole in a grim silence  from which the zealous attentions of M. de Frilair were no more capable than  the rude frankness of Fouque, of making her emerge.</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>一种疯狂而又无法报复的嫉妒，一种无望的不幸的持续（纵使于连获救，又如何能挽回他的心？），一往情深地爱上这个不忠的情人所造成的羞辱和痛苦，使德·拉莫尔小姐陷入沮丧的沉默，纵有德·福利莱先生的殷勤照顾和富凯的粗犷的坦率，也不能使她得到解脱。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>As for  Julien, except during the moments usurped by the presence of Mathilde, he was  living upon love and with hardly a thought of the future. A curious effect of  this passion, in its extreme form and free from all pretence, was that Madame  de Renal almost shared his indifference and mild gaiety.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>至于于连，除去被玛蒂尔德占用的时间外，倒是生活在爱情之中，几乎不问明天的事。当这种热情是极端的、没有任何矫饰的时候，就产生出一种奇特的效果，德·莱纳夫人因此几乎分享着他的无忧无虑和温馨的快乐。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'In the  past,' Julien said to her, 'when I might have been so happy during our walks in  the woods of Vergy, a burning ambition led my soul into imaginary tracts.  Instead of my pressing to my heart this lovely arm which was so near to my  lips, the thought of my future tore me away from you; I was occupied with the  countless battles which I should have to fight in order to build up a colossal  fortune… No, I should have died without knowing what happiness meant, had you  not come to visit me in this prison.'</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>“从前，”于连对她说，“我们在韦尔吉的树林里散步的时候，我本来可以多么地幸福啊，可是一种强烈的野心却把我带到虚幻之国去了。不是把这近在唇边的可爱的胳膊紧抱在胸前，却让未来的幻想给夺去了；我为了建立巨大的财富，不得不进行数不清的战斗……不，如果您不来监狱看我，我死了还不知道什么是幸福呢。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Two  incidents occurred to disturb this tranquil existence. Julien's confessor, for  all that he was a Jansenist, was not immune from an intrigue by the Jesuits,  and quite unawares became their instrument.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>两件事扰乱了这平静的生活，于连的忏悔神甫尽管是位詹森派，却没有逃过耶稣会士的算计，不知不觉中成了他们的工具。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He came  one day to inform him that if he were not to fall into the mortal sin of  suicide, he must take every possible step to obtain a reprieve.Now,  the clergy having considerable influence at the Ministry of Justice in Paris,  an easy method offered itself: he must undergo a sensational conversion…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一天他来对于连说，除非他愿意犯下可怕的自杀之罪，否则他应该想尽一切可能的办法去争取特赦。而教士在巴黎的司法部里有很大的影响，于是就有了一个很容易的办法：应该大张旗鼓地皈依宗教……”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sensational!'  Julien repeated. 'Ah! I have caught you at the same game,Father, play-acting  like any missionary … '</p>

</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“大张旗鼓！”于连重复道，“啊！我也抓住您了，我的父亲，您也像一个传教士一样在演戏啊……”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'Your  tender age,' the Jansenist went or gravely, 'the interesting appearance with  which Providence has blessed you, the motive itself of your crime, which  remains inexplicable, the heroic measures of which Mademoiselle de La Mole is  unsparing on your behalf, everything, in-short, including the astonishing  affection that your victim shows for you,all these have combined to make you  the hero of the young women of Besancon. They have forgotten everything for  you, even politics …</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>“您的年纪，”詹森派教士严肃地说，“您从上天得来的动人的面孔，您那无法解释的犯罪动机，德·拉莫尔小姐为您做出的英勇举动，总之是一切，直到您的受害者对您表示出的惊人的友情，都有助于使您成为贝藏松的年轻女人们心目中的英雄。她们已然为了您把一切都忘了，甚至忘了政治……”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'Your  conversion would strike an echo in their hearts, and would leave a profound  impression there. You can be of the greatest service to religion, and am I to  hesitate for the frivolous reason that the Jesuits would adopt the same course  in similar circumstances! And so, even in this particular case which has  escaped their rapacity, they would still be doing harm! Let such a thing never  be said… The tears which will flow at your conversion will annul the corrosive  effect of ten editions of the impious works of Voltaire.'</p></div>
<div class="right">




<p>“您皈依宗教会在她们心中引起反响，留下深刻的印象。您可以对宗教大有用处，而我，难道因为耶稣会士会在这种情况下采取同样的做法这种毫无意义的理由，就犹豫不决吗！因此，在这个逃脱他们的贪欲的特殊情况下，他们仍会为害作孽的！但愿不会这样……您的皈依宗教使人洒下的眼泪将抵销十版伏尔泰的亵渎宗教的作品所产生的腐蚀作用。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'And  what shall I have left,' replied Julien coldly, 'if I despise myself? I have  been ambitious, I have no wish to reproach myself; I acted then according to  the expediency of the moment. Now, I am living from day today. But, generally  speaking, I should be making myself extremely unhappy, if I gave way to any  cowardly temptation … '</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>“那我还剩下什么，”于连冷冷地称道，“如果我自轻自贱？我曾经野心勃勃，我不愿谴责我自己；那时我是根据时代的风尚行动。现在，我过一天是一天。但是，如果我做出某种怯懦的事情，我就在众目睽睽之下自找不幸……”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>The  other incident, which affected Julien far more keenly, arose from Madame de  Renal. Some intriguing friend or other had managed to persuade this simple,  timid soul that it was her duty to go to Saint-Cloud, and to throw herself at  the feet of King Charles X.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>另一件事来自德·莱纳夫人，更让于连感到痛苦。不知哪位诡计多端的女友竟把这颗天真而又如此腼腆的灵魂说服了，让她相信她的责任是到圣克卢去，跪在查理十世面前求情。</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>She had  made the sacrifice of parting from Julien, and after such an effort, the  unpleasantness of making a public spectacle of herself, which at any other time  would have seemed to her worse than death, was no longer anything in her eyes.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>和于连分开，对她原本是一种牺牲，然而以过这样一番努力之后，抛头露面在别的时候可能是一桩比死还要难受的事，现在在她眼里却不算什么了。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'I  shall go to the King, I shall confess proudly that you are my lover: the life  of a man, and of such a man as Julien, must outweigh all other considerations.  I shall say that it was out of jealousy that you attempted my life. There are  endless examples of poor young men who have been saved in such cases by the  humanity of a jury, or by that of the King … '</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我要去见国王，我要公开承认你是我的情人，因为一个人的生命，一个于连这样的人的生命，应该超过任何利弊的权衡。我要说你是因为嫉妒才谋害我的性命的。有许多可怜的年轻人在这种情况下由于陪审团或国王慈悲而得救……”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'I  shall cease to see you, I shall bar the door of my prison against you,' cried  Julien, 'and most certainly I shall kill myself in despair, the day after,  unless you swear to me that you will take no step that will make us both a  public spectacle. This idea of going to Paris is not yours. Tell me the name of  the intriguing woman who suggested it to you …</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我不再见你了，我叫人对你关上监狱的大门，”于连嚷道，“如果你不对我发誓不做任何使我们俩当众出丑的事，我明天肯定因绝望而自杀。去巴黎的主意不是你的。告诉我那个让你起了这个念头的女阴谋家的名字……”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'Let us  be happy throughout the few remaining days of this brief life.Let us  conceal our existence; my crime is only too plain. Mademoiselle de La Mole has  unbounded influence in Paris, you may be sure that she is doing all that is  humanly possible. Here in the provinces, I have all the wealthy and respectable  people against me. Your action would embitter still further these wealthy and  above all moderate men, for whom life is such an easy matter … Let us not give  food for laughter to the Maslons,the Valenods, and a thousand people better  worth than they.'</p></div>
<div class="right">




<p>“让我们幸福地度过这短暂的生命的为数不多的几天吧。藏起我们的存在吧，我们的罪孽已经太明显了。德·拉莫尔小姐在巴黎很有影响，相信她会做人力可及的一切事情吧。在外省，所有有钱有势的人都反对我。你的行动会更激努那些有钱的、特别是温和的人，对他们来说，生活是一件多么容易的事……不要让马斯隆们、瓦勒诺们以及许多比他们也人笑话我们。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>The bad  air of the cell became insupportable to Julien. Fortunately on the day on which  he was told that he must die, a bright sun was gladdening the earth, and he  himself was in a courageous mood. To walk in the open air was a delicious  sensation to him, as is treading solid earth to A mariner who has long been at  sea. 'There, all is well,' he said to himself, 'I am not lacking in courage.'</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>牢里的恶劣空气，于连已不能忍受。幸亏他们通知他赴死的那一天，明媚的阳光使万物洋溢着欢乐，于连也浑身充满了勇气。在露天行走，给了他一种甜美的感觉，仿佛久在海上颠簸的水手登上陆地散步一样。“来吧，一切顺利，”他对自己说，“我一点儿都不缺乏勇气。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Never  had that head been so poetic as at the moment when it was about to fall. The  most precious moments that he had known in the past in the woods of Vergy came  crowding into his mind with an extreme vividness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>这颗头颅从不曾像将要落地时那么富有诗意。从前他在韦尔吉的树林里度过的那些最温馨的时刻纷至沓来，极其有力地涌上他的脑际。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Everything  passed simply, decorously, and without affectation on his part.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一切都进行得简单、得体，在他这方面则没有任何的矫情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Two  days earlier, he had said to Fouque: </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>两天前，他曾对富凯说：</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'For my emotions I cannot answer; this  damp and hideous cell gives me moments of fever in which I am not myself; but  fear, no; no one shall see me blench.'</p>

</div>

<div class="right">


<p>“激动，我不能保证；这地牢这样恶劣潮湿，使我有时发烧，神志不清；但是恐惧，不，人们不会看到我脸色发白的。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He had  made arrangements in advance that on the morning of the last day, Fouque should  carry off Mathilde and Madame de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他事先做了安排，在他末日的那天早上，富凯把玛蒂尔德和德·莱纳夫人都带走。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>'Take  them in the same carriage,' he had told him. 'Arrange that the post-horses  shall gallop all the time. They will fall into one another's arms, or else will  show a deadly hatred for one another. In either case, the poor women will have  some slight distraction from their terrible grief.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“让她们坐一辆车，”他对他说，“设法让驿车的马不停地奔跑。她们会相互拥抱，或者相互恨得要死。在这两种情况下，可怜的女人都会从可怕的痛苦中解脱一下。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had made Madame de Renal swear that she would live to look after Mathilde's  child</p>.</div>
<div class="right">



<p>于连一定要德·莱纳夫人发誓活下去，好照顾玛蒂尔德的儿子。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>'Who  knows? Perhaps we continue to have sensation after our death,' he said one day  to Fouque. 'I should dearly like to repose, since repose is the word, in that  little cave in the high mountain that overlooks Verrieres. Many a time, as I  have told you, retiring by night to that cave, and casting my gaze afar over  the richest provinces of France, I have felt my heart ablaze with ambition: it  was my passion then … Anyhow, that cave is precious to me, and no one can deny  that it is situated in a spot that a philosopher's heart might envy… Very well!  These worthy members of the Congregation of Besancon make money out of  everything; if you know how to set about it, they will sell you my mortal  remains … '</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>“谁知道呢？也许我们死后有感觉。”有一天他对富凯说，“我相当喜欢在俯视维里埃的大山里的那小山洞里安息，是的，安息，正是这个词。我有好几次跟你讲过，夜里躲进这个山洞，极目远眺法国那些最富庶的省份，野心燃烧的我的心，那时候这就是我的激情……总之，这个山洞对我是很珍贵的，不能不承认它的位置令一个哲学家的灵魂羡慕不已……好吧！贝藏松的这些圣会分子什么都拿来赚钱；如果你知道怎么做，他们会把我的遗体卖给你的……”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Fouque  was successful in this grim transaction. He was spending the night alone in his  room, by the body of his friend, when to his great surprise, he saw Mathilde  appear. A few hours earlier, he had left her ten leagues from Besancon. There  was a wild look in her eyes.</p></div>

<p>富凯做成了这桩悲惨的买卖。他独自在他的房间里，守着朋友的尸体度过黑夜。突然他大吃一惊，看见玛蒂尔德走了进来。几个种头之前，他把她留在距贝藏松十法里的地方。她形容大变，目光狂乱。</p>

<p>'I wish  to see him,' she said to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我想看看他，”她对他说。</p>

<p>Fouque  had not the courage to speak or to rise. He pointed with his finger to a great  blue cloak on the floor; in it was wrapped all that remained of Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>富凯没有勇气说话，也没有勇气站起来。他指了指地板上件蓝色的大氅，于连的遗体就裹在里面。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  fell upon her knees. The memory of Boniface de La Mole and of Marguerite de  Navarre gave her, no doubt, a super-human courage. Her trembling hands unfolded  the cloak. Fouque turned away his eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她跪下了。显然，对博尼法斯·德·拉莫尔和玛格丽特·德·纳瓦尔的回忆给了她超人的勇气。她双手颤抖着，揭开了大氅。富凯把眼睛转过去。</p>

<p>He  heard Mathilde walking rapidly about the room. She lighted a number of candles.  When Fouque had summoned up the strength to look at her, she had placed  Julien's head upon a little marble table, in front of her, and was kissing his  brow …</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>他听见玛蒂尔德在房间里急促的走动。她点燃了她几支蜡烛。当富凯有力气看她的时候，她已经把于连的头放在面前的一张小石桌上，吻那头的前额……</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Mathilde  followed her lover to the tomb which he had chosen for himself. A great number  of priests escorted the coffin and, unknown to all, alone in her draped  carriage, she carried upon her knees the head of the man whom she had so dearly  loved.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>玛蒂尔德跟着她的情人，一直走到他为自己选下的坟墓。为数众多的教士护送着棺材，没有人知道她就独自坐在她那辆蒙着黑纱的车子里，膝上放着她曾经如此爱恋过的人的头。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Coming  thus near to the summit of one of the high mountains of the Jura, in the middle  of the night, in that little cave magnificently illuminated with countless  candles, a score of priests celebrated the Office of the Dead. All the  inhabitants of the little mountain villages, through which the procession  passed, had followed it, drawn by the singularity of this strange ceremony.</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>就这样，他们半夜里来到汝拉山脉一座高峰的附近；在那个小山洞里，无数的蜡烛照得通明，二十个教士做着安灵的仪式。送殡的行列经过几个小山村，居民们为这奇特的仪式吸引，纷纷跟着。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Mathilde  appeared in their midst in a flowing garb of mourning, and,at the end of the  service, had several thousands of five franc pieces scattered among them.</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>玛蒂尔德身着长长的丧服，出现在他们中间；丧事毕，她命人向他们抛撒了好几千枚五法郎的硬币。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>Left  alone with Fouque, she insisted upon burying her lover's head with her own  hands. Fouque almost went mad with grief.</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>她单独和富凯留下，她要亲手埋葬她的情人的头颅。富凯痛苦得差点儿发疯。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>By  Mathilde's orders, this savage grot was adorned with marbles sculptured at  great cost, in Italy.</p></div>

<p>在玛蒂尔德的关心下，这个荒蛮的山洞用花巨款在意大利雕刻的大理石装饰起来。</p>

<div class="left"><p>Madame  de Renal was faithful to her promise. She did not seek in any way to take her  own life; but, three days after Julien, died while embracing her children.</p>
