<p>And  I received promotion, not on my own merits, but because my master had the gout.</p>

<p>我得到了提升，不是因为我的功能，而是因为我的主人有痛风病。</p>

  <div class="left"><p>The  reader is perhaps surprised at this free and almost friendly tone; we have  forgotten to say that for six weeks the Marquis had been confined to the house  by an attack of gout.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>读者也许对这种随便的、近乎友好的口气感到惊讶，我们忘了说，六个礼拜以来，侯爵一直被困在家里，他的痛风病发作了。</p>

</div></div>

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole and her mother were at Hyeres, with the Marquise's mother. Comte  Norbert saw his father only for brief moments; they were on the best of terms,  but had nothing to say to one another. M. de La Mole, reduced to Julien's  company, was astonished to find him endowed with ideas. He made him read the  newspapers aloud.Soon  the young secretary was able to select the interesting passages.There  was a new paper which the Marquis abhorred; he had vowed that he would never  read it, and spoke of it every day. Julien laughed. The Marquis, out of  patience with the times, made Julien read him Livy; the translation improvised  from the Latin text amused him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐和她的母亲在耶尔，跟侯爵夫人的母亲在一起。诺贝尔伯爵不时地来看看他父亲，父子间关系非常好，但彼此无话可说。德·拉莫尔先生只好跟于连在一起，倒发现他有些思想，不免感到惊奇。他让于连给他读报。年轻的秘书很快即能挑选有趣的段落。有一份新报侯爵很是痛恨，发誓永远不看，却每天都要谈到。于连笑了。侯爵对当今这个时代感到气愤，让于连给他读李维的作品，把拉丁文即席翻译过来，听起来很开心。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  day the Marquis said, with that tone of over elaborate politeness, which often  tried Julien's patience:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天，侯爵用常使于连不胜其烦的过分客气的口吻说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Allow  me, my dear Sorel, to make you the present of a blue coat:when  it suits you to put it on and to pay me a visit, you will be, in my eyes, the  younger brother of the Comte de Chaulnes, that is to say, the son of my old  friend the Duke.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我亲爱的索莱尔，请允许我作为礼物送您一件蓝色的礼服。当您高兴穿上它来看我时，在我的眼里，您就是德·肖纳伯爵的弟弟了，也  就是说，我的朋友老公爵的儿子”。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was somewhat in the dark as to what was happening; that evening he ventured to  pay a visit in his blue coat. The Marquis treated him as an equal. Julien had a  heart capable of appreciating true politeness, but he had no idea of the finer  shades. He would have sworn, before this caprice of the Marquis, that it would  be impossible to be received by him with greater deference. 'What a marvellous  talent!' Julien said to himself; when he rose to go, the Marquis apologised for  not being able to see him to the door on account of his gout.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连不大明白个中消息，当晚，他试着穿上蓝礼服去见侯爵。侯爵待他果然视若平等。于连的心能够感觉到真正的礼貌，但是细微的差别，还是分辨不出。他在侯爵起了这个怪念头之前，可以发誓说，侯爵待他好得不能再好了。“多了不起的聪明才智啊！”于连心里说。他起身告辞的时候，侯爵表示歉意，因痛风病发作，不能送他。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was obsessed by this strange idea: 'Can he be laughing at me?' he wondered. He  went to seek the advice of the abbe Pirard, who, less courteous than the  Marquis, answered him only with a whistle and changed the subject. The  following morning Julien appeared before the Marquis, in a black coat, with his  portfolio and the letters to be signed.He  was received in the old manner. That evening, in his blue coat, it was with an  entirely different tone and one in every way as polite as the evening before.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连生出一个古怪的念头：“他是在嘲弄我吗？”他百思不得其解，便去请教彼拉神甫。神甫可没有侯爵那么有礼貌，只吹了声口哨，就去谈别的事情了。第二天早晨，于连穿着风衣，带着文件夹和待签的信件去见侯爵，他受到的接待又跟以往一样了。晚上，换上蓝礼服，接待他的口吻全然不同，跟前一天晚上一样地客气。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Since  you appear to find some interest in the visits which you are so kind as to pay  to a poor, suffering old man,' the Marquis said to him, 'you must speak to him  of all the little incidents in your life, but openly, and without thinking of  anything but how to relate them clearly and in an amusing fashion. For one must  have amusement,' the Marquis went on; 'that is the only real thing in life. A  man cannot save my life on a battlefield every day, nor can he make me every  day the present of a million; but if I had Rivarol here, by my couch, every  day, he would relieve me of an hour of pain and boredom. I saw a great deal of  him at Hamburg, during the Emigration.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“既然您好心看望一个可怜的、生病的老人而又不感到过于厌烦，”侯爵对他说，“您就应该跟他讲讲您生活中的各种小事情，但要坦率，不要想别的，只想讲得清楚、有趣。因为我们得寻开心啊，”侯爵继续说，“人生中只有这才是真实的。一个人不能每天都在战争中救我的命，或者送我一百万；如果在这里，在我的长椅旁，我有里瓦罗尔，他就会每天为我解除一小时的疼痛和厌烦。流亡期间，我在汉堡跟他很熟。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  the Marquis told Julien stories of Rivarol among the Hamburgers, who would club  together in fours to elucidate the point of a witty saying.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然后，侯爵给于连讲里瓦罗尔跟汉堡人的一些趣闻，四个汉堡人凑在一起才能理解他的一句俏皮话。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de La Mole, reduced to the society of this young cleric, sought to enliven him.  He stung Julien's pride. Since he was asked for the truth, Julien determined to  tell his whole story; but with the suppression of two things: his fanatical  admiration for a name which made the Marquis furious, and his entire unbelief,  which hardly became a future cure. His little affair with the Chevalier de  Beauvoisis arrived most opportunely. The Marquis laughed till he cried at the  scene in the cafe in the Rue Saint Honore, with the coachman who covered him  with foul abuse. It was a period of perfect frankness in the relations between  employer and protege.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>侯爵不得已与这小神甫为伍，想让他兴奋起来。他用荣誉刺激于连的骄傲。既然人家要他讲真话，于连就决定什么都说出来；但有两件事  情他不说：他对一个名字的狂热崇拜，侯爵听见这名字会发脾气的；还有他那彻底的不信神，这对一个未来的本堂神甫不大合适。他和德·博瓦西骑士的那场小纠纷来得正好。侯黔听到在圣奥诺雷街的咖啡馆里，车夫用脏话骂他的场面，笑出了眼泪，这是主人和被保护人之间肝胆相照的时候。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de La Mole became interested in this singular character. At first, he played  with Julien's absurdities, for his own entertainment; soon he found it more  interesting to correct, in the gentlest manner, the young man's mistaken view  of life. 'Most provincials who come to Paris admire everything,' thought the  Marquis; 'this fellow hates everything. They have too much sentiment, he has  not enough, and fools take him for a fool.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔先生对这个独特的性格有了兴趣。起初，他喜欢于连的可笑，为的是开心取乐；很快，他觉得慢慢地纠正这年轻人看人看事的错误方式更有意义。“别的外省人来到巴黎对什么都赞不绝口，”侯爵想，“而这个外省人对什么都恨。他们有太多的做作，而他的却还不够，傻瓜们把他看成傻瓜。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  attack of gout was prolonged by the wintry weather and lasted for some months.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>痛风病的发作因为冬季的严寒，一直拖着，持续了好几个月。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  becomes attached to a fine spaniel,' the Marquis told himself; 'why am I so  ashamed of becoming attached to this young cleric? He is original. I treat him  like a son; well, what harm is there in that! This fancy, if it lasts, will  cost me a diamond worth five hundred louis in my will.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有人喜欢漂亮的西班牙猎犬，”侯爵心想，“为什么我喜欢这个小神甫却感到这么难为情呢？他与众不同。我把他当儿子看待，那又怎  么样！有何不妥？这个怪念头，如果持续下去，我就在遗嘱中付出一粒值五百路易的钻石。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Once  the Marquis had realised the firm character of his protege, he entrusted him  with some fresh piece of business every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>侯爵一旦了解了他的被保护人的坚强性格，就每天都派他去处理新的事务。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  noticed with alarm that this great nobleman would occasionally give him  contradictory instructions with regard to the same matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连注意到，这位大贵人有时会对同一件事做出矛盾的决定，很害怕。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  was liable to land him in serious trouble. Julien, when he came to work with  the Marquis, invariably brought a diary in which he wrote down his  instructions, and the Marquis initialled them. Julien had engaged a clerk who  copied out the instructions relative to each piece of business in a special  book. In this book were kept also copies of all letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这可能给他带来严重的损害。于是，于连跟他一起工作的时候，总是带着一个登记簿，把他的决定写在上面，侯爵则签字画押。于连用了  一个文书，由他把有关每件事的决定抄录在一个特殊的登记簿上。这个登记簿也抄录了所有的信件。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  idea seemed at first the most ridiculous and tiresome thing imaginable. But, in  less than two months, the Marquis realised its advantages. Julien suggested  engaging a clerk from a bank, who should keep an account by double entry of all  the revenue from and expenditure on the estates of which he himself had charge.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个主意开始时好像荒唐之极，无聊之极。然而不出两个月，侯爵就感到了它的好处。于连建议他雇一个在银行家手下干过的文书，把于连负责管理的那些田地的所有收入和支出记成复式帐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>These  measures so enlightened the Marquis as to his own financial position that he  was able to give himself the pleasure of embarking on two or three fresh  speculations without the assistance of his broker, who had been robbing him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这些措施使侯爵对自己的事务一目了然，甚至还能欣欣然进行了两、三次投机活动，而不必假手出面人，他们常常欺骗他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Take  three thousand francs for yourself,' he said, one day to his young minister.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您自己拿三千法郎吧，”一天，他对年轻的助手说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But,  Sir, my conduct may be criticised.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，我的品行可能受到诽谤。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  do you want, then?' replied the Marquis, with irritation.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那您要怎么样？”侯爵生气地说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  want you to be so kind as to make a formal agreement, and to write it down  yourself in the book; the agreement will award me a sum of three thousand  francs. Besides, it was M. l'abbe Pirard who first thought of all this  bookkeeping.' The Marquis, with the bored expression of the Marquis de Moncade,  listening to M. Poisson, his steward, reading his accounts, wrote out his  instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请您做一个决定，亲手写在登记簿上；这个决定写明给我三千法郎。况且，是彼拉神甫想到要记帐的。”侯爵带着德·蒙卡德侯爵听管  家普瓦松先生报帐时的那种厌烦神色，写下了他的决定。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  the evening, when Julien appeared in his blue coat, there was never any talk of  business. The Marquis's kindness was so flattering to our hero's easily wounded  vanity that presently, in spite of himself, he felt a sort of attachment to  this genial old man. Not that Julien was sensitive, as the word is understood  in Paris; but he was not a monster, and no?  one, since the death of the old Surgeon-Major, had spoken to him so  kindly. He remarked with astonishment that the Marquis showed a polite  consideration for his self-esteem which he had never received from the old  surgeon. Finally he realised that the surgeon had been prouder of his Cross  than the Marquis was of his Blue Riband. The Marquis was the son of a great  nobleman.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>晚上，当于连穿上蓝礼服出现时，他们绝口不谈事务。侯爵的关怀使我们的主人公那一直痛苦着的自尊心感到那样地舒服，很快就不由自主地对这位可亲的老人生出一种眷恋之情。这并不是说，于连易动感情，如巴黎人所理解的那样；但于连并非没有心肝之人，自从老外科军医死后，还没有人像侯爵那样亲切地跟他说话。他惊奇地注意到，侯爵很有礼貌地照顾他的自尊心，而他在老外科军医那里却从未见过。他终于明白，为什么军医对他的十字勋章要比侯爵对他的蓝绶带更感到自豪。侯爵的父亲是一位大贵人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  day, at the end of a morning interview, in his black coat, and for the  discussion of business, Julien amused the Marquis, who kept him for a couple of  hours, and positively insisted upon giving him a handful of bank notes which  his broker had just brought him from the Bourse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天早晨，于连着黑衣，为了谈事务来见侯爵，谈话结束时，侯爵很高兴，多留了他两个钟头，一定要把出面人刚从交易所送来的钞票送几张给他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  hope, Monsieur le Marquis, not to be wanting in the profound respect which I  owe you if I ask you to allow me to say something.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我希望，侯爵先生，求您允许我说句话而不至于让我背离我理应对您怀有的深深敬意。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Speak,  my friend.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说吧，我的朋友。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Will  Monsieur le Marquis be graciously pleased to let me decline this gift. It is  not to the man in black that it is offered, and it would at once put an end to  the liberties which he is so kind as to tolerate from the man in blue.' He  bowed most respectfully, and left the room without looking round.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我拒绝这迹份礼物，望侯爵先生俯允。这礼物不该送给黑衣人，它会让您好心地容忍蓝衣人的种种态度蒙垢。”他毕恭毕敬地行了个礼  ，看也不看一眼就走了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  attitude amused the Marquis, who reported it that evening to the abbe Pirard.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个举动使侯爵很开心。晚上，他讲给彼拉神甫听。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'There  is something that I must at last confess to you, my dear abbe. I know the truth  about Julien's birth, and I authorise you not to keep this confidence secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“有一件事我得向您承认了，我亲爱的神甫。我知道于连的出身，而且我允许您不为这段隐情保守秘密。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'His  behaviour this morning was noble,' thought the Marquis, 'and I shall ennoble  him.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他今天早晨的态度是高贵的，”侯爵想，“而我要让他成为贵族。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Some  time after this, the Marquis was at length able to leave his room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>不久，侯爵终于可以出门了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Go  and spend a couple of months in London,' he told Julien. 'The special couriers  and other messengers will bring you the letters I receive, with my notes. You  will write the replies and send them to me, enclosing each letter with its  reply. I have calculated that the delay will not amount to more than five days.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“到伦敦住上两个月，”他对于连说，“特别信使和其他信使会把我收到的信连同我的批语送给您。您写好回信，连同原信再给我送回来  。我算了一下，要耽搁也不过五天工夫。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  he travelled post along the road to Calais, Julien thought with amazement of  the futility of the alleged business on which he was being sent.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在通往加来的大路上一站站地赶，于连觉得奇怪，让他去办的那些所谓事务都无关紧要。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>We  shall not describe the feeling of horror, almost of hatred, with which he set  foot on English soil. The reader is aware of his insane passion for Bonaparte.  He saw in every officer a Sir Hudson Lowe, in every nobleman a Lord Bathurst,  ordering the atrocities of Saint Helena, and receiving his reward in ten years  of office.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连是怀着怎样一种仇恨、近乎厌恶的感情踏上英国的土地的，我们就不去说了。我们知道他对波拿巴怀有狂热的激情。他把每个军官都  看成哈得逊·洛爵士，他把每个大贵人都看成巴瑟斯特勒勋爵，圣赫勒拿岛上那些卑鄙的事就出于他的命令，他得到的酬报就是当了十年内阁大臣。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  London he at last made acquaintance with the extremes of fatuity.He  made friends with some young Russian gentlemen who initiated him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在伦敦，他终于知道了什么是贵族的自命不凡。他结识了几位年轻的俄国贵族，他们为他指点门径。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are predestined, my dear Sorel,' they told him, 'you are endowed by nature with  that cold expression a thousand leagues from the sensation of the moment, which  we try so hard to assume.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您生来不凡，我亲爱的索莱尔，”他们对他说，“您天生一副冷脸，距现时的感觉千里之遥，我们用尽千方百计而终不可得。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  have not understood our age,' Prince Korasoff said to him; 'always do the  opposite to what people expect of you. That, upon my honour, is the only  religion of the day. Do not be either foolish or affected, for then people will  expect foolishness and affectations, and you will not be obeying the rule.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您不理解您的时代，”科拉索夫亲王对他说，“您要永远和人们对您的期待背道而驰。我以名誉担保，这是时代的唯一宗教。勿疯狂，  勿造作，因为人们期待于您的正是疯狂和造作，而那条格言也就实现不了了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  covered himself with glory one day in the drawing-room of the Duke of Fitz  Fulke, who had invited him to dine, with Prince Korasoff.The  party were kept waiting for an hour. The way in which Julien comported himself  amid the score of persons who stood waiting is still quoted by the young  Secretaries of Embassy in London. His expression was inimitable.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一天，菲茨－福尔克公爵请于连和科拉索夫亲王吃晚饭，他在客厅里大出风头。人们等了一个钟头。于连在二十个等待着的人当中的举止，至今驻伦敦大使馆的年轻秘书们还津津乐道，他的神态真是妙不可言。</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  was anxious to meet, notwithstanding his friends the dandies, the celebrated  Philip Vane, the one philosopher that England has produced since Locke. He  found him completing his seventh year in prison. 'The aristocracy does not take  things lightly in this country,' thought Julien; 'in addition to all this, Vane  is disgraced, abused,' etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他不顾他那些浪荡朋友的反对，一定要去看望著名的菲利普·范恩，自洛克以降英国唯一的哲学家。他见他的时候，他正要结束第七年的监禁。“在这个国家里，贵族是不开玩笑的，”于连想；“而且，范恩已经声名扫地，备受诋毁……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  found him good company; the fury of the aristocracy kept him amused. 'There,'  Julien said to himself, as he left the prison, 'is the one cheerful man that I  have met in England.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连发现他精神饱满，贵族的狂怒消除了他的烦闷。“瞧，”于连走出监狱时对自己说，“这是我在英国看见的唯一的快活人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  idea of most use to tyrants is that of God,' Vane had said to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“对暴君最有用的观念是上帝的观念，”范恩曾对他说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>We  suppress the rest of the philosopher's system as being cynical.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的犬儒主义的体系的其余部分，我们略去不谈了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  his return: 'What amusing idea have you brought me from England?' M. de La Mole  asked him. He remained silent. 'What idea have you brought, amusing or not?'  the Marquis went on, sharply.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他回来后，德·拉莫尔先生问：“您从英国给我带回什么有趣的思想？”……他不说话。“您带回什么思想了，有趣还是没有趣？”侯爵  又急急问道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'First  of all,' said Julien, 'the wisest man in England is mad for an hour daily; he  is visited by the demon of suicide, who is the national deity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“第一，”于连说，“最明智的英国人每天都有一个钟头是疯狂的；他有自杀这个魔鬼光顾，此为国家之神。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Secondly,  intelligence and genius forfeit twenty-five per cent of their value on landing  in England.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“第二，在英国上岸后，机智和才华都要贬值百分之二十。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Thirdly,  nothing in the world is so beautiful, admirable, moving as the English  countryside.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“第三，世界上没有什么东西比英国风景更美丽、更动人、更值得赞赏。”</p>

<p>'Now,  it is my turn,' said the Marquis.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“该我说了，”侯爵说，</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'First  of all, what made you say, at the ball at the Russian Embassy, that there are  in France three hundred thousand young men of five and twenty who are  passionately anxious for war? Do you think that that is quite polite to the  Crowned Heads?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“第一，为什么您要到俄国大使的舞会上去说法国有三十万二十五岁的年轻人渴望战争？您以为这种话是国王们爱听的吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  never knows what to say in speaking to our great diplomats,' said Julien. They  have a mania for starting serious discussions. If one confines oneself to the  commonplaces of the newspapers, one is reckoned a fool.If  one allows oneself to say something true and novel, they are astonished, they  do not know how to answer, and next morning, at seven o'clock they send word to  one by the First Secretary, that one has been impolite.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“跟我们那些大外交家们说话，真不知如何是好，”于连说，“他们动辄进行一本正经的讨论。如果说些报纸上的老生常谈，您就会被当  成傻瓜。如果胆敢说些真实的、新鲜的东西，他们就会大吃一惊，不知回答什么好，而第二天早上七点钟，他们会派大使馆一等秘书来对您说，您失礼了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Not  bad,' said the Marquis, with a laugh. 'I wager, however, Master Philosopher,  that you have not discovered what you went to England to do.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不坏，”侯爵笑着说。“尽管如此，我敢打赌，思想深刻者先生，您没有猜到您为什么去英国。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Pardon  me,' replied Julien; 'I went there to dine once a week with His Majesty's  Ambassador, who is the most courteous of men.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请原谅，”于连说；“我每个礼拜一次去国王的大使那里吃晚饭，他是个最有礼貌的人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  went to secure the Cross which is lying there' the Marquis told him. 'I do not  wish to make you lay aside your black coat, and I have grown accustomed to the  more amusing tone which I have adopted with the man in blue. Until further  orders, understand this: when I see this Cross, you are the younger son of my  friend the Duc de Chaulnes, who, without knowing it, has been for the last six  months employed in diplomacy. Observe,' added the Marquis, with a highly  serious air, cutting short Julien's expressions of gratitude, 'that I do not on  any account wish you to rise above your station. That is always a mistake, and  a misfortune both for patron and for protege. When my lawsuits bore you, or  when you no longer suit me I shall ask for a good living for you, like that of  our friend the abbe Pirard, and nothing more,' the Marquis added, in the driest  of tones.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您是去找这枚勋章呀，”侯爵对他说。“我不想让您脱掉这身黑衣服，而我己习惯于和穿蓝衣服的人用那种更有趣的口吻说话。在没有  新的命令之前，请您听好：当我看见这枚勋章时，您就是我的朋友肖纳公爵的小儿子，六个月之前就被雇用在外交界工作，不过自己并不知道。请您注意，”侯爵补充说，神色很严肃，并且打断了于连感激的表示，“我决不想改变您的身份。对保护人和被保护人来说，那都是一个错误和一个不幸。什么时候我的那些官司让您厌倦了，或者您不再适合我了，我会为您请求一个好的本堂区，像我们的朋友彼拉神甫的那个本堂区一样，仅此而已，”侯爵用很生硬的口气补充说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  Cross set Julien's pride at rest; he began to talk far more freely. He felt  himself less frequently insulted and made a butt by those remarks, susceptible  of some scarcely polite interpretation, which, in the course of an animated  conversation, may fall from the lips of anyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这枚勋章让于连的自尊得到满足，话也多得多了。他自以为不那么经常地受到一些可能引起不礼貌解释的话的冒犯了，或者成为这些话的目标，而在热烈的谈话中，这种话的含义不是一下子就能听出来的。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  Cross was the cause of an unexpected visit; this was from M. le Baron de  Valenod, who came to Paris to thank the Minister for his Barony and to come to  an understanding with him. He was going to be appointed Mayor of Verrieres in  the place of M. de Renal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这枚勋章给他招来了一次不寻常的拜访，是德·瓦勒诺男爵先生，他来巴黎是为了向内阁感谢封他为男爵，并与之修好。他很快要取代德·莱纳先生，被任命为维里埃的市长了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was consumed with silent laughter when M. de Valenod gave him to understand  that it had just been discovered that M de Renal was a Jacobin. The fact was  that, in a new election which was in preparation, the new Baron was the  ministerial candidate, and in the combined constituency of the Department,  which in reality was strongly Ultra, it was M. de Renal who was being put  forward by the Liberals.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·瓦勒诺先生告诉他，他们刚刚发现德·莱纳先生是个雅各宾党人，于连暗自觉得非常好笑。事实是这样的：选举正在准备中，新男爵是内阁推荐的候选人，而自由党却向实际上极端保王的省大选举团推荐了德·莱纳先生。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was in vain that Julien tried to learn something of Madame de Renal; the Baron  appeared to remember their former rivalry, and was impenetrable. He ended by  asking Julien for his father's vote at the coming election. Julien promised to  write.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连想知道一点德·莱纳夫人的情况，但是没有成功；男爵看来对他们的旧怨还耿耿于怀，一点儿口风也不露。最后，他请求于连让他父亲在即将举行的选举中投他的票，于连答应写信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  ought, Monsieur le Chevalier, to introduce me to M. le Marquis de La Mole.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“骑士先生，您该把我介绍给德·拉莫尔侯爵先生。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Indeed,  so I ought,' thought Julien; 'but a rascal like this!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“的确，我该这么做，”于连想，“可他这样一个无赖！……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  be frank,' he replied, 'I am too humble a person in the Hotel de La Mole to  take it upon me to introduce anyone.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说实在的，”他回答，“我在德·拉莫尔府是个太小的伙计，没有资格介绍。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  told the Marquis everything: that evening he informed him of Valenod's  pretension, and gave an account of his life and actions since 1814.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连有什么事都告诉侯爵，当晚他就把瓦勒诺的要求以及他自一八一四年以来的所作所为，都讲给侯爵听。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Not  only,' M. de La Mole replied, with a serious air, 'will you introduce the new  Baron to me tomorrow, but I shall invite him to dine the day after. He will be  one of our new Prefects.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您不仅明天要把新男爵介绍给我，”侯爵神情十分严肃地说，“我后天还要请他吃晚饭。他将是我们的新省长中的一个。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  that case,' retorted Julien coldly, 'I request the post of Governor of the  Poorhouse for my father.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这样的话，”于连冷冷地说，“我要为我父亲要那个乞丐收容所所长的位置。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Excellent,'  said the Marquis, recovering his gaiety; 'granted; I was expecting a sermon.  You are growing up.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好哇，”侯爵说，神色又变得快活，“同意。我正等着一番说教呢。您开始成熟了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Valenod informed Julien that the keeper of the lottery office at Verrieres  had just died; Julien thought it amusing to bestow this place upon M. de  Cholin, the old imbecile whose petition he had picked up in the room occupied  there by M. de La Mole. The Marquis laughed heartily at the petition which  Julien recited as he made him sign the letter applying for this post to the  Minister of Finance.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·瓦勒诺先生告诉于连，维里埃市的彩票局局长新近去世，于连觉得把这个位置给德·肖兰先生很有意思，他从前曾在德·拉莫尔先生  住过的房间里拾到过这个老笨蛋的请求书。于连一边背诵那份请求书，一边让侯爵在向财政部请求这个位置的信件上签字，侯爵开怀大笑。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>No  sooner had M. de Cholin been appointed than Julien learned that this post had  been requested by the Deputies of the Department for M. Gros, the celebrated  geometrician: this noble-hearted man had an income of only fourteen hundred  francs, and every year had been lending six hundred francs to the late holder  of the post, to help him to bring up his family.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·肖兰先生刚被任命，于连就获悉该省众议员们曾为著名的几何学家格罗先生请求这个位置：这个高尚的人只有一千四百法郎的年金，每年借给刚去世的彩票局局长六百法郎，帮助他养家。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was astonished at the effect of what he had done. 'It is nothing,' he told  himself; 'I must be prepared for many other acts of injustice, if I am to  succeed, and, what is more, must know how to conceal them, under a cloak of  fine sentimental words: poor M, Gros! It is he that deserved the Cross, it is I  that have it, and I must act according to the wishes of the Government that has  given it to me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连对自己的所为大吃一惊。“这没什么，”他对自己说，“如果我想发迹，还得干出许许多多不公乐的事来，而且还得会用动人的漂亮话遮掩起来：可怜的格罗先生！配得上这枚勋章的是他，可得到的却是我，我应该遵照给我勋章的政府的意旨行事。”
