<p>All  hearts were moved. God's presence seemed to have come down into these narrow,  gothic streets, decked on every side, and strewn with sand through the good  offices of the faithful.</p>
<p>YOUNG</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>每一个人的心都被打动了。仿佛天主降临到了这些处处都挂着帷幔的，信徒们还仔细铺上细沙的，狭窄的，哥特式的街道上。</p>

  <div class="left"><p>In vain might Julien make himself small and  foolish, he could not give satisfaction, he was too different. 'And yet,' he  said to himself, 'all these Professors are men of great discernment, and picked  men, each of them one in a thousand; how is it they do not like my humility?'  One alone seemed to him to be taking advantage of his readiness to believe  anything and to appear taken in by everything. This was the abbe Chas Bernard,  Master of Ceremonies at the Cathedral, where, for the last fifteen years, he  had been kept in hopes of a Canonry; in the meantime, he taught sacred  eloquence at the Seminary. In the period of his blindness, this class was one  of those in which Julien most regularly came out at the top. The abbe Chas had  been led by this to show a partiality for him, and, at the end of his class,  would gladly take his arm for a turn in the garden.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连装小装傻，都没有用，他不能讨人喜欢，他太特殊了。“不过，”他想，“这些老师都是些精明人，千里挑一挑出来的，何以也不喜欢我的谦卑呢？”他觉得他的殷勤只蒙住了一个人，因为这个人什么都信，似乎什么当都上。此人就是大教堂的司仪长夏斯一贝尔纳神甫，十五年前，人家让他觉得有望得到议事司好的位置，他就一边等，一边在神学院里教授布道术。在于连还蒙在鼓里的那个时期，有几门功课他常得第一，其中就有布道术。夏斯神甫为此对他表示友好，下了课，很愿意挽住他的胳膊在花园里转几圈。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What can his object be?' Julien asked  himself. He found with amazement that, for hours on end, the abbe talked to him  of the ornaments which the Cathedral possessed. It had seventeen apparelled  chasubles, apart from the vestments worn at requiems. They had great hopes of  President de Rubempre's widow; this lady, who was ninety years old, had  preserved for at least seventy of those years her wedding garments of superb  Lyons stuffs, figured in gold.'Just imagine, my friend,' said the abbe Chas  coming to a standstill and opening his eyes wide, 'these stuffs stand by  themselves, there is so much gold in them. It is common opinion in Besancon  that, under the Presidente's will, the treasury of the Cathedral will be  enriched with more than ten chasubles, not to mention four or five copes for  the greater feasts. I will go farther,' the abbe Chas added, lowering his  voice. 'I have good reason to think that the Presidente will bequeath to us  eight magnificent silver-gilt candlesticks, which are supposed to have been  bought in Italy, by the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, whose favourite  minister was an ancestor of hers.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他到底想干什么？”于连心里说。他感到奇怪，夏斯神甫跟他谈大教堂拥有的饰物，一谈就是几个钟头。除了丧事用的饰物，大教堂共有十七件镶有饰带的祭披。大家对老迈的吕班普莱议长夫人寄于很大希望；这位老夫人已九十岁，七十年来一直保存着结婚礼服，那是用夹了金线的上好里昂料子做的。“想想看，我的朋友，”夏斯神甫说道，一下子站住了，睁大了眼睛，“用的金子那么多，料子都立得住。在贝藏松，大家普遍认为，议长夫人的遗嘱将使大教堂的宝库增加十多件祭披，还不算四、五件重大节日用的无袖长袍。更有甚者，”夏斯神甫压低声音，补充说，“我有理由认为，议长夫人会给我们留下八个精美的镀金银烛台，据说是勃民第公爵大胆查理从意大利买回来的，她的先人中有一位曾是他的宠臣。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>' But what is this man really aiming at  behind all this frippery?' Julien wondered. 'This careful preparation has been  going on for an age, and nothing comes of it. He must have singularly little  faith in me! He is cleverer than any of the others, whose secret purposes one  can see so plainly after a fortnight. I understand, this man's ambition has  been in torment for fifteen years.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是，这个人说了一大通旧衣服，他究竟想干什么呢？”于连想。“这种铺垫真巧妙，做了一百年，可我还是什么也没看出来。他肯定是不信任我！他比那些人都机灵，那些人的秘密目的我只用两个礼拜就猜出来了。我知道了，此人十五年来一直受着野心的折磨！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One evening, in the middle of the armed  drill, Julien was sent for by the abbe Pirard, who said to him:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天晚上，正在上剑术课，于连被叫到彼拉神甫处，神甫对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Tomorrow  is the feast of Corpus Christi. M. l'abbe Chas Bernard requires you to help him  to decorate the Cathedral; go and obey.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“明天是CorpusDomini节（圣体节）。夏斯—贝尔纳神甫先生需要您帮他装饰大教堂，去吧，要服从。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The abbe Pirard called him back, and added,  in a tone of compassion:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>彼拉神甫又把他叫住，带着体恤的神情补充说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It is for you to decide whether you wish  to seize the opportunity of taking a stroll through the town.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这是一个进城走走的机会，就看您愿意不愿意了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Incedo per ignes,' replied Julien: which  is to say, I am treading on dangerous ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“Incedoperignes（我有敌人藏着呢），”于连答道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Next morning at daybreak, Julien made his  way to the Cathedral, walking with lowered eyes. The sight of the streets and  the activity which was beginning to pervade the town did him good. On every  side people were draping the fronts of their houses for the procession. All the  time that he had spent in the Seminary seemed to him no more than an instant.  His thoughts were at Vergy, and with that charming Amanda Binet, whom he might  meet, for her cafe was but little out of his way. He saw in the distance the  abbe Chas Bernard, standing by the door of his beloved Cathedral; he was a  large man with a joyful countenance and an open air. This morning he was  triumphant: 'I have been waiting for you, my dear son,' he called out, as soon  as he caught sight of Julien, 'you are welcome. Our labours this day will be  long and hard, let us fortify ourselves with an early breakfast; the other we  shall take at ten o'clock during high mass.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天一大早，于连前往大教堂，一路上两眼低垂。看到街道，看到城里已开始出现的热闹景象，于连感到很舒服。为了迎圣体，到处都  有人在房屋正面张挂帷幔。他觉得，他在神学院度过的全部时光，实在不过一瞬而已，他想到韦尔吉，想到那位漂亮的阿芒达·比奈，也许能碰见她，她的咖啡馆不太远。夏斯—贝尔纳神甫正站在他心爱的大教堂门口，于连老远就看见了；那是一个面相快活神情开朗的胖子。“我正等着您哪，我亲爱的儿子，”他一看见于连就叫道，“欢迎您。今天的活儿很重，时间又长，我们先吃头顿早饭，添些力气，第二顿在大弥撒中间十点钟开。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I desire, Sir,' Julien said to him with an  air of gravity, 'not to be left alone for a moment; kindly observe,' he added,  pointing to the clock above their heads, 'that I have arrived at one minute  before five.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，我希望，”于连神情庄重地说，“我希望时时刻刻有人跟我在一起，烦请注意，”他指着头上的钟，补充说，“我是五点差一分到达的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah! So you are afraid of those young  rascals at the Seminary! It is too kind of you to give them a thought,' said  the abbe Chas; 'is a road any the worse, because there are thorns in the hedges  on either side of it? The traveller goes his way and leaves the wicked thorns  to wither where they are. However, we must to work, my dear friend, to work.' </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！神学院的那些小坏蛋让您害怕了！您想到他们，这很好，”夏斯神甫说，“一条道路因为两旁的篱笆有刺就不那么美丽了吗？旅人赶路，让扎人的刺在原地枯萎。还是干活吧，亲爱的朋友，干活吧！”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The abbe Chas had been right in saying that  their labours would be hard. There had been a great funeral service in the  Cathedral the day beore; it had been impossible to make any preparations; they  were obliged, therefore, in the course of the morning, to drape each of the  gothic pillars which separate the nave from the aisles in a sort of jacket of red  damask which rose to a height of thirty feet. The Bishop had ordered four  decorators from Paris by mail coach, but these gentlemen could not do  everything themselves, and so far from encouraging the awkward efforts of their  Bisontine colleagues they increased their awkwardness by laughing at it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>夏斯神甫说得对，活儿很重，大教堂前一天举行过盛大的葬礼；任何准备工作都没有做，因此要在一个上午把形成三个殿的那些哥特式廊柱都用一种红色锦缎套子罩起来。主教先生用邮车从巴黎请来四个帷幔匠，但是这些先生也不能把活儿都包了，而且他们非但不能鼓励那些笨手笨脚的贝藏松的伙伴，反而嘲笑他们，使他们更笨了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien saw that he would have to go up the  ladders himself, his agility stood him in good stead. He undertook to direct  the local decorators in person.The abbe Chas was in ecstasies as he  watched him spring from one ladder to another. When all the pillars were hung  with damask, the next thing was to go and place five enormous bunches of plumes  on top of the great baldachino, over the high altar. A richly gilded wooden  crown was supported on eight great twisted columns of Italian marble. But,  in order to reach the centre of the baldachino, over the tabernacle, one had to  step across an old wooden cornice, possibly worm-eaten, and forty feet from the  ground. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连一看，他得自己爬梯子了，他的灵活帮了他大忙。他负起了指挥本城帷幔匠的责任。夏斯神甫大喜，看见他从一架梯子飞到另一架梯子。所有的柱子都罩上了锦缎，接下来要把五个巨型的羽毛束放在主祭坛上方的大华盖上。那是一个繁复的木制绘金顶怖，由八根意大利大理石螺旋型大柱子支撑着。但是，要到达大圣体龛上方的华盖的中心，心须走过一条木头上楣，这段木头颇陈旧，可能已遭虫蛀，并且离地四十尺高。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The sight of this perilous ascent had extinguished the gaiety, so  brilliant until then, of the Parisian decorators; they looked at it from  beneath, discussed it volubly, and did not go up. Julien took possession of the  bunches of plumes, and ran up the ladder. He arranged them admirably upon the  ornament in the form of a crown in the centre of the baldachino.As  he stepped down from the ladder, the abbe Chas Bernard took him in his arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>看见这条险路，一直神采飞扬的巴黎帷幔匠，个个傻了眼；他们从底下住上看，叽叽喳喳地议论，就是不上去。于连抓起羽毛束，一溜跑，登上梯子。他把羽毛束稳稳地放在华盖中心的冠状饰物上。他从梯子上下来，夏斯—贝尔纳神甫把他抱在怀里：</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Optime!' exclaimed the worthy priest, 'I  shall tell Monseigneur of this.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好极了，”善良的教士叫道，“我要把这讲给主教大人听。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Their ten o'clock breakfast was a merry  feast. Never had the abbe Chas seen his church looking so well.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>十点钟的那顿饭吃得很快活。夏斯神甫从未见过他的教堂如此美丽。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My dear disciple,' he said to Julien, 'my  mother used to hire out chairs in this venerable fane, so that I was brought up  in this great edifice. Robespierre's Terror ruined us; but, at eight years old,  as I then was, I was already serving masses in private houses, and their owners  gave me my dinner on mass days. No one could fold a chasuble better than I, the  gold braid was never broken. Since the restoration of the Faith by Napoleon, it  has been my happy lot to take charge of everything in this venerable mother  church. On five days in the year, my eyes behold it decked out with these  beautiful ornaments. But never has it been so resplendent, never have the  damask strips been so well hung as they are today, have they clung so to the  pillars.'At last, he is going to tell me his  secret,' thought Julien, 'here he is talking to me of himself; he is beginning  to expand.' But nothing imprudent was said by this man, evidently in an excited  state. 'And yet he has worked hard, he is happy,' Julien said to himself, 'the  good wine has not been spared. What a man! What an example for me! He takes the  prize.'(This was a low expression which he had picked up from the old surgeon.)</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“亲爱的弟子，”他对于连说，“我母亲曾在这座可敬的教堂里出租椅子，所以我是在这座伟大的建筑物里长大的。罗伯斯庇尔的恐怖把  我们毁了；但是我那时已经八岁，能在私人家里举行的弥撒上帮忙了，所以做弥撒的日子，他们给我饭吃。要说折祭披，谁也没有我折得好，饰带从未断过。自从拿破仑恢复宗教信仰以来，我有幸在这座可敬的大主教堂里指导一切事务。一年五次，我亲眼看见它用这些如此美丽的饰物装扮起来。但是它从未像今天这样富丽堂皇，锦缎的幅面从未像今天这样平展，这样紧紧贴着柱子。”我道出他的秘密了，”于连想，“他在谈自己，这是倾吐衷肠啊。”然而，这个明显地兴奋难耐的人却什么不慎的话都没说出来。“不过，他干了不少活儿，他很幸福，”于连想，“好葡萄酒也没少喝。怎样的一个人啊！对我来说，怎样的傍样啊！他有点晕乎了。（这是他从老军医那里学来的一句粗话。）”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When the Sanctus bell rang during high  mass, Julien wished to put on a surplice so as to follow the Bishop in the  superb procession. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>大弥撒的Sanctus响了，于连想穿上白法衣，跟着主教参加盛大的圣体游行。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And the robbers, my friend, the robbers!' cried the abbe  Chas, 'you forget them. The procession is going out; the church will be left  empty; we must keep watch, you and I. We shall be fortunate if we lose only a  couple of ells of that fine braid which goes round the base of the pillars.That  is another gift from Madame de Rubempre; it comes from the famous Count, her  great-grandfather; it is pure gold, my friend,' the abbe went on, whispering in  his ear, and with an air of evident exaltation, 'nothing false about it! I  entrust to you the inspection of the north aisle, do not stir from it. I keep  for myself the south aisle and nave. Keep an eye on the confessionals; it is  there that the robbers' women spies watch for the moment when our backs are  turned.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“还有小偷呢，我的朋友，还有小偷呢！”夏斯神甫叫道，“您没有想到啊。游行队伍要出来了，教堂里要空了；您和我，我们得看着。  如果围着柱脚的美丽的金线只丢失两奥纳，那就是我们的造化。那也是吕班普莱夫人的馈赠；那是从她的曾祖父、那位著名的伯爵那里得来的；是纯金的，我亲爱的朋友，”神甫贴着他的耳朵，显然很激动地补充说，”一点儿也没掺假！我让您负责查看北侧殿，呆在那里别出来；南侧殿和大殿归我。注意那些神工架；就是从那儿，小偷的女眼目盯着我们转身的那当儿。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As he finished speaking, the quarter before  twelve struck, at once the big bell began to toll. It was being pulled with all  the ringers' might; the rich and solemn sound stirred Julien deeply. His  imagination rose from the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他刚说完，十一点三刻的钟声响了，紧跟着那口大钟也响了。钟声大作，如此饱满，如此庄严，感动了于连。他的想象飘然远去，离开了尘世。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The odour of the incense and of the rose  leaves strewn before the Blessed Sacrament by children dressed as little Saint  Johns, intensified his excitement.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>神香的香气，化装成圣约翰的孩子们撒在圣体前的玫瑰花瓣的香气，终于使他激动起来。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The sober note of the bell ought to have  suggested to Julien only the thought of the work of a score of men earning  fifty centimes, and assisted perhaps by fifteen or twenty of the faithful. He  ought to have thought of the wear and tear of the ropes, of the timber, of the  danger from the bell itself which fell every two hundred years, and to have  planned some way of diminishing the wage of the ringers, or of paying them with  some indulgence or other favour drawn from the spiritual treasury of the  Church, with no strain upon her purse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>那口钟的声音如此庄严，本来只应让他想到二十个人的劳动，他们的报酬只有五十个生丁，也许还有十五或二十个信徒帮助他们。他应该  想到绳子的磨损、钟架的磨损、钟本身的危险，那钟每两个世纪掉下一次；他应该考虑图什么办法降低打钟人的工钱，考虑用赦罪或用取自教会的财富而又不使其钱袋瘪下去的其它恩宠来支付他们的工钱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In place of these sage reflections,  Julien's soul, excited by these rich and virile sounds, was straying through  imaginary space. Never will he make either a good priest or a great  administrator. Souls that are moved thus are capable at most of producing an artist.  Here Julien's presumption breaks out in the full light of day. Fifty, perhaps,  of his fellow seminarists, made attentive to the realities of life by the  public hatred and Jacobinism which, they are told, is lurking behind every  hedge, on hearing the big bell of the Cathedral, would have thought only of the  wages paid to the ringers. They would have applied the genius of a Bareme to  determine the question whether the degree of emotion aroused in the public was  worth the money given to the ringers. Had Julien chosen to give his mind to the  material interests of the Cathedral, his imagination flying beyond its goal  would have thought of saving forty francs for the chapter , and would have let  slip the opportunity of avoiding an outlay of twenty-five centimes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连没有做这些明智的考虑，他的心灵受到如此雄壮如此饱满的声音激励，在想象的空间里邀游起来。他永远也成不了一个好教士，成不了一个干练的行政官员。像这样容易激动的心灵顶多适于产生艺术家。此时此刻，于连的自负暴露无遗。他的那些神学院的同学，因为民众的仇恨和人们告诉你们每道篱笆后面都隐藏着雅各宾主义而去注意生活的现实，其中也许有五十个听到大教堂的钟声之后只考虑打钟人的工钱。他们会用巴莱姆的天才去检查民众的感动程度是否和付给打钟人的钱相符。但凡于连愿意考虑大教堂的物质利益，他那冲出目标的想象力也会考虑怎样为教堂的维修节省四十法郎，会放过一次避免支付二十五生丁的机会。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While, in the most perfect weather ever  seen, the procession wound its way slowly through Besancon, and halted at the  glittering stations which all the local authorities had vied with one another  in erecting, the church remained wrapped in a profound silence. A suffused  light, an agreeable coolness reigned in it; it was still balmy with the  fragrance of flowers and incense.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一天，天气再晴朗不过，圣体游行的队伍缓缓走过贝藏松，不时停留在有权势的人们竟相搭起的辉煌的祭坛前面，教堂则沉浸在一片幽深的寂静之中。半明半暗，一片宜人的清凉；神香和鲜花的香气仍旧到处弥漫着。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The silence, the profound solitude, the  coolness of the long aisles, made Julien's musings all the sweeter. He had no  fear of being disturbed by the abbe Chas, who was occupied in another part of  the building. His soul had almost quitted its mortal envelope, which was  strolling at a slow pace along the north aisle committed to his charge. He was  all the more at rest, since he was certain that there was nobody in the  confessionals save a few devout women; he saw without observing. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>寂静，深深的孤独，长形大殿里的清凉，使于连的梦幻更加温柔甜蜜了。他不必担心受到夏斯神甫的打扰，他正在另一个地方忙着呢。于连的灵魂几乎抛弃了肉体的外衣，在归他查看的北翼慢步徜徉。他确信忏悔室内只有几个虔诚的女人，他就更平静了；他漫不经心地看了一眼。</p>



</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  distraction was nevertheless half conquered by the sight of two women extremely  well dressed who were kneeling, one of them in a confessional, the other, close  beside her, upon a chair. He saw without observing them; at the same time,  whether from a vague sense of his duty,o r from admiration of the plain but  noble attire of these ladies, he remarked that there was no priest in that  confessional. 'It is strange,' he thought, 'that these beautiful ladies are not  kneeling before some station, if they are religious; or placed in good seats in  the front of some balcony, if they are fashionable. How well cut that gown is!  What grace!' He slackened his pace in order to see their faces. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>然而，他的心不在焉还是不能彻底，因为他看见两个穿戴极好的女人，一个跪在忏悔室里，另一个在她旁边，跪在一把椅子上。他随意看了一眼，或是朦朦胧胧地感到了责任，或是赞叹两位太太的高贵而淡雅的装束，他注意到忏悔室内并没有教士。“这就怪了，”他想，“她们若是虔诚的，就该跪在祭坛前；若是上流社会中人，就该赫然置身某个阳台的第一排。这连衣裙剪裁得多好！多雅致！”他放慢了脚步，想看看她们。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The one who was  kneeling in the confessional turned her head slightly on hearing the sound of  Julien's step amid the prevailing silence. All at once she gave a little cry,  and fainted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>于连的脚步声在深邃的寂静中响起，跪在忏悔座里的女人听见了，略微偏了偏头。突然，她轻轻叫了一声，晕过去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  her strength left her, this kneeling lady fell back; her friend, who was close  at hand, hastened to the rescue. At the same time Julien caught sight of the  shoulders of the lady who had fallen back. A rope of large seed pearls, well  known to him, caught his eye. What was his state when he recognised the hair of  Madame de Renal! It was she. The lady who was trying to hold up her head, and  to arrest her fall, was Madame Derville. Julien, beside himself with emotion,  sprang forward; Madame de Renal's fall would perhaps have brought down her  friend if he had not supported them. He saw Madame de Renal's head, pale,  absolutely devoid of consciousness, drooping upon her shoulder. He helped  Madame Derville to prop that charming head against the back of a straw chair;  he was on his knees. 

<p>Madame Derville turned and recognised him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这跪着的女人没了力气，向后一仰；她的朋友，紧挨在她身边，跳起来扶住她。就在这时，于连看见了向后跌倒的女人的肩膀。一条用精  美的大颗珍珠串成的绞形项链引起他的注意，他很熟悉啊。当他认出德·莱纳夫人的头发时，他是多么激动啊！正是她。试着扶住她的头不让她跌倒的那位太太是德尔维夫人。于连不顾一切地冲上去，若不是他扶住她们，德·莱纳夫人倒下去，还会拖上她的朋友。德·莱纳夫人面无血色，毫无知觉，头软绵绵地靠在他的肩上。他帮着德尔维夫人让这迷人的头靠在一把草垫椅子的背上。他跪下了。</p>

<p>德尔维夫人转过头，认出了他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Fly, Sir, fly!' she said to him in accents  of the most burning anger. 'On no account must she see you again. The sight of  you must indeed fill her with horror, she was so happy before you came! Your  behaviour is atrocious. Fly; be off with you, if you have any shame left.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“走开，先生，走开！”她对他说，口气中带着最强烈的愤怒。“特别是不要让她再见到您。见到您只会使她感到厌恶，她在见到您之前  是那样的幸福！您的手段太残忍了。走开，走得远远的，如果您还有一点廉耻的话。”</p>

<p>This speech was uttered with such  authority, and Julien felt so weak at the moment, that he withdrew. 'She always hated me,' he said to himself,  thinking of Madame Derville.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这句话说得那么强硬，于连此时那么虚弱，不容他不离开。“她一直在恨我，”他想到德尔维夫人，自言自语道。</p>

<p>At that moment, the nasal chant of the  leading priests in the procession rang through the church; the procession was  returning. The abbe Chas Bernard called repeatedly to Julien, who at first did  not hear him: finally he came and led him by the arm from behind a pillar where  Julien had taken refuge more dead than alive. He wished to present him to the  Bishop.</p>

<p>这时，教堂里响起游行队伍前排的教士们哼哼呀呀的歌声，他们回来了。夏斯—贝尔纳神甫叫了于连好几声，他没有听见，他过去抓住他  的胳膊把他从一根大柱子后面拖了出来。于连躲在那里，半死不活。神甫想把他介绍给主教。</p>

<p>'You are feeling unwell, my child,' said  the abbe, seeing him so pale and almost unable to walk; 'you have been working  too hard.' The abbe gave him his arm. 'Come, sit down here, on the sacristan's  little stool, behind me; I shall screen you.' They were now by the side of the  main door. 'Calm yourself, we have still a good twenty minutes before  Monseigneur appears. Try to recover yourself; when he passes, I shall hold you  up, for I am strong and vigorous, in spite of my age.'</p>
</div>

<p>“您不舒服，我的孩子，”神甫见他那么苍白，几乎走不动路；“您干活儿太多了。”神甫把胳膊伸给他。“来，坐在这张洒圣水的小凳子上，在我背后，我挡着您。”此时他们正在大门一侧。“您放心，还有二十分钟主教大人才露面呢。努力恢复您的精神，他经过时，我扶您起来，我虽年老但还强壮有力。”</p>

<p>But when the Bishop passed, Julien was so  tremulous that the abbe Chas abandoned the idea of presenting him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>但是主教经过时，于连抖得那么厉害，夏斯神甫只好放弃引见他的打算。</p>

<p>'Do not worry yourself about it,' he told  him, 'I shall find another opportunity.'</p>
</div>

<p>“别太难过了，”他对他说，“我还会找到机会的。”</p>

<p>That evening, he sent down to the  chapel of the Seminary ten pounds of candles, saved, he said, by Julien's  efforts and the rapidity with which he extinguished them. Nothing could have  been farther from the truth. The poor boy was himself extinguished; he had not  had a thought in his head after seeing Madame de Renal.</p>

<p>晚上，他让人给神学院的小教堂送来十斤蜡烛，说是于连细心和熄灭蜡烛动作迅速节省下来的。根本不是那么回事。可怜的孩子自己也熄  灭了，自从见到德·莱纳夫人，他的脑海里已是一片空白。
