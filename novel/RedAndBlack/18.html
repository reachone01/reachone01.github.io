<p>Are you fit only to be flung down like the  corpse of a nation, its soul gone and its veins emptied of blood?</p>
<p>(From the Bishop's address, delivered in  the Chapel of Saint Clement)</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>难道你们只适于像没有灵魂、血管里不再有血的老百姓的尸体那样抛弃掉吗？</p>
<p>主教在圣克雷芒教堂发表的讲话</p></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>On  the third of September, at ten o'clock in the evening, a mounted constable  aroused the whole of Verrieres by galloping up the main street; he brought the  news that His Majesty the King of — was coming the following Sunday, and it was  now Tuesday. The Prefect authorised, that is to say ordered, the formation of a  Guard of Honour; he must be received with all the pomp possible. A courier was  sent to Vergy. M. de Renal arrived during the night and found the whole town in  a ferment. Every body was claiming a right to something; those who had no other  duty were engaging balconies to see the King enter the town.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>九月三日晚十点，一宪兵飞马奔上大街，惊醒了整个维里埃城；他带来消息，国王陛下将于下星期日到达，而现在已是星期二了。省长批准，也就是说要求组建一支仪仗队，要尽可能地铺张排场。一个急使被派往韦尔吉。德·莱纳先生连夜赶回，看见全城都动起来了。每一个人都有所要求，那些闲人则租用阳台以观看国王进城。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Who  was to command the Guard of Honour? M. de Renal saw at once how important it  was, in the interest of the houses that would have to be moved back, that M. de  Moirod should fill this post. It might be held to constitute a claim to the  place of Principal Deputy. There was nothing to be said against M. de Moirod's  devotion; it went beyond all comparison, but he had never ridden a horse in his  life. He was a man of six and thirty, timid in every way, and equally afraid of  falls and of being laughed at.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>谁将指挥仪仗队？德·莱纳先生立刻就看出，为了那些要往后缩的房屋的利益，让德·穆瓦罗先生来指挥是多么地重要。这可以成为取得第一助理职位的一种资格。德·穆瓦罗先生的虔诚无话可说，谁也比不了，可是他从来没有骑过马。此人三十六岁，胆子极小，既怕从马上摔下来，又怕惹人笑话。</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Mayor sent for him at five o'clock in the morning. .</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>早晨五点钟，市长就命人把他叫了去。</p>



</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You see, Sir, that I am  asking your advice, as though you already occupied the post in which all  right-minded people would gladly see youIn  this unfortunate town the manufacturers prosper, the Liberal Party are becoming  millionaires, they aspire to power, they will forge themselves weapons out of  everything. We must consider the King's interests, those of the Monarchy, and  above all those of our holy religion. To whom do you think, Sir, that we ought  to entrust the command of the Guard of Honour?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“您看得出来，先生，我征求您的意见，就好像您已经担任有教养的人都希望您担任的那个职务了。在这座不幸的城市里，制造业繁荣兴  旺，自由党成了百万富翁，并且渴望着权力，他们是什么都可以拿来作武器的。想想国王的利益、王朝的利益和我们神圣的教会的利益吧。先生，您想我们能把指挥仪仗队的重任交给谁呢？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  spite of the horrible fear that a horse inspired in him, M. de Moirod ended by  accepting this honour like a martyr. 'I shall manage to adopt the right  manner,' he told the Mayor. There was barely time to overhaul the uniforms  which had been used seven years before on the passage of a Prince of the Blood.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管怕马怕得要命，德·穆瓦罗先生还是像殉道者一样地接受了这个荣誉。“我会举止得体的，”他对市长说。时间不多了，他刚来得及让人把制服整理好，那还是七年前一位亲王路经时用过的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  seven, Madame de Renal arrived from Vergy with Julien and the children. She  found her drawing-room full of Liberal ladies who were preaching the union of  parties, and had come to implore her to make her husband find room in the Guard  of Honour for theirs. One of them asserted that if her husband were not chosen  he would go bankrupt from grief. Madame de Renal sent them all packing at once.  She seemed greatly occupied.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>七点钟，德·莱纳夫人和于连带着孩子们从韦尔吉回来了。她发现客厅里挤满了自由党人的太太，她们主张各党派联合一致，求她让丈夫把仪仗队里的位置给她们各自的丈夫一个。其中的一位还说，如果她的丈夫不能入选，他会因伤心而破产的。德·莱纳夫人很快把这些人打发走了。她显得十分忙碌。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was surprised and even more annoyed by her making a mystery to him of what was  disturbing her. 'I thought as much,' he told himself bitterly, 'her love is  eclipsed by the joy of receiving a King in her house. All this excitement  dazzles her. She will begin to love me again when her brain is no longer  troubled by ideas of caste.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连感到惊奇，更感到恼火，她竟神秘兮兮地，不告诉他是什么使她这样激动。“我早料到了，”他想，深感痛苦，“碰上在家里接待一位国王这样的幸福，她的爱情就无影无踪了。这一番喧闹搞得她眼花缭乱。要等到她那些等级观念不再搅乱她的头脑时，她才会再爱我。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  surprising thing was that he loved her all the more for this.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>真是怪事，他反而更爱她了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  upholsterers began to invade the whole house, he long watched in vain for an  opportunity of saying a word to her. At length he found her coming out of his  own room, carrying one of his coats. They were alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>屋子里到处都是干活的人，己经开始布置了。他等了好久，也没有抓到机会跟她说句话。终于，他看见她从他的房间里出来，拿着他的一  件衣服。周围没有人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  tried to speak to her. She made off, declining to listen to him. 'What a fool I  am to be in love with a woman like that, ambition makes her just as stupid as  her husband.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他想跟她说话。她不听，一溜烟跑了。“我真傻，竟爱上这样一个女人，野心使她变得和她的丈夫一样疯狂。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  was even more so: one of her great wishes, which she had never confessed to  Julien, for fear of shocking him, was to see him discard, if only for a day,  his gloomy black coat. With an ingenuity truly admirable in so natural a woman,  she secured, first from M. de Moirod, and then from the Sub-Prefect M. de  Maugiron, that Julien should be appointed to the Guard of Honour in preference  to five or six young men, sons of manufacturers in easy circumstances, at least  two of whom were of an exemplary piety. M. Valenod, who was reckoning on  lending his carriage to the prettiest women of the town, in order to have his  fine Norman horses admired, agreed to let Julien, the person he hated most,  have one of them. But each of the members of the Guard of Honour possessed or  had borrowed one of those sky-blue coats with a pair of colonel's epaulettes in  silver, which had shone in public seven years before.Madame  de Renal wanted a new coat, and she had but four days in which to send to  Besancon, and to procure from there the uniform, the weapons, the hat, and all  the other requisites for a Guard of Honour.>What  is rather amusing is that she thought it imprudent to have Julien's coat made  at Verrieres. She wished to take him by surprise, him and the town.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她可是疯得更厉害呢，她有一个强烈的愿望，就是看见于连脱下那阴沉的黑衣服，哪怕一天也好。这个如此天真朴实的女人使出的手段还真叫人佩服，她先后说服了德·穆瓦罗先生和专区区长德·莫吉隆先生，让于连当上了仪仗队员，挤掉了五、六个年轻人，他们都是很富有的制造商的子弟，其中两个在信教虔诚方面还堪称表率，瓦勒诺先生原打算把马车借给本城最漂亮的女人，炫耀一下他的诺曼底骏马，现在也同意借一匹给于连，这个他最恨的人。所有的仪仗队员都有自己的或借来的漂亮的天蓝色制服，这种有着银质上校肩章的制服七年前曾经风光过一回。德·莱纳夫人希望能有一套新的，她只有四天时间派人去贝藏松买回制服、武器、帽子等一个仪仗队员所需要的全部行头。有趣的是，她觉得在维里埃给于连做衣服是不郑重的。她想让于连和全城的人都大吃一惊。</p>


</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  work of organising the Guard of Honour and popular feeling finished, the Mayor  had next to deal with a great religious ceremony; the King of —— refused to  pass through Verrieres without paying a visit to the famous relic of Saint  Clement which is preserved at BrayleHaut, a hort league from the town. The  clergy must be present in full force, and this was the most difficult thing to  arrange; M. Maslon, the new cure, was determined, at any price, to keep M.  Chelan out. In vain did M. de Renal point out to him the imprudence of this  action. The Marquis de La Mole, whose ancestors for so long were Governors of  the Province, had been chosen to accompany the King of ——. He had known the  abbe Chelan for thirty years. He would be certain to inquire for him on  arriving at Verrieres, and, if he found that he was in disgrace, was quite  capable of going in search of him, to the little house to which he had retired,  accompanied by such of the procession as were under his orders. What a rebuff  that would be!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>组织仪仗队和鼓动人心的工作结束以后，市长就忙于筹备盛大的宗教仪式，因为国王想在路过维里埃时参拜圣克雷芒的遗骨，这遗骨是出了名的，保存在离城不到一法里的博莱－勒欧镇。参加的教士多多益善，不过安排起来却最难；新任本堂神甫马斯隆先生想尽力避免谢朗先生在场。德·莱纳先生向他指出这样做是不慎重的，然而没有用。德·拉莫尔侯爵先生的祖上有几位曾长期担任本省省督，这次他被指定陪同国王。他认识谢朗神甫已有三十年。他到维里埃时肯定会打听他的消息，如果发现他已失宠，他可是那种去他隐居的小房子里看他的那种人，而且还带着他能动用的所有随从。怎样的一记耳光啊！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am dishonoured here and at Besancon,' replied the abbe Maslon, 'if he appears  among my clergy. A Jansenist, great heavens!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是我在这里和在贝藏松就得丢脸了，”马斯隆神甫回答说，“如果他出现在我的教士中间的话。一个詹森派，伟大的天主！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Whatever  you may say, my dear abbe,' M. de Renal assured him, 'I shall not expose the  municipal government of Verrieres to the risk of an insult from M. de La Mole.  You don't know the man, he is sound enough at court; but here, in the country,  he has a satirical, mocking spirit, and likes nothing so much as to embarrass  people. He is capable, simply for his own amusement, of covering us with  ridicule in the eyes of the Liberals.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不管您能说什么，我亲爱的神甫，”德·莱纳先生反驳道，“我决不让维里埃的市政府冒这个险，让德·拉莫尔先生羞辱一番。您还不  了解他，他在宫里循规蹈矩，可在这里，在外省，却是个恶作剧者，喜欢挖苦讽刺，一心想使人难堪。他可以单单为了取乐就让我们在自由党人面前出丑。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was not until the night between Saturday and Sunday, after three days of  discussion, that the abbe Maslon's pride gave way before the Mayor's fear,  which had turned to courage. The next thing was to write a honeyed note to the  abbe Chelan, inviting him to be present at the veneration of the relic at  BrayleHaut, his great age and infirmities permitting.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过三天谈判，到了星期六的夜里，马斯隆神甫的傲慢才在市长那已然变成勇气的恐俱面前屈服，还得给谢朗神甫写一封甜言蜜语的信，请求他在高龄和体弱允许的情况下出席博莱—勒欧的遗骨瞻仰仪式。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  Chelan asked for and obtained a letter of invitation for Julien, who was to  accompany him in the capacity of sub-deacon.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>谢朗先生为于连求得一份请柬，于连将作为助祭陪伴他。</p>

<p>Early  on Sunday morning, thousands of peasants, arriving from the neighbouring  mountains, flooded the streets of Verrieres. It was a day of brilliant  sunshine. At length, about three o'clock, a tremor ran through the crowd; they  had caught sight of a beacon blazing on a rock two leagues from Verrieres. This  signal announced that the King had just entered the territory of the  Department. Immediately the sound of all the bells and the repeated discharge  of an old Spanish cannon belonging to the town proclaimed its joy at this great  event. Half the population climbed up on the roofs. All the women were on the  balconies. The Guard of Honour began to move. The brilliant uniforms were  greatly admired, each of the onlookers recognised a relative or friend. There was  general laughter at the alarm of M. de Moirod, whose cautious hand lay ready at  any moment to clutch hold of his saddle. But one thing made them forget all the  others: the left-hand man in the ninth section was a handsome lad, very  slender, who at first was not identified. Presently a cry of indignation from  some, the astonished silence of others announced a general sensation.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>星期天一早，成千上万邻近山里的农民就到了，涌进维里埃的街道。天气极好。终于，将近三点钟，人群骚动起来，有人看见距维里埃两法里的一座悬崖上燃起了大火。这个信号宣布国王刚刚踏上本省地界，立刻，钟声齐鸣，一尊属于本城的古老的西班牙大炮频频发射，表示对这件大事的喜悦。女人们都在阳台上。仪仗队开始动作。光彩夺目的制服受到称赞，人人都认出了一个亲戚，—个朋友。大家嘲笑德·穆瓦罗先生的胆怯，他那小心翼翼的手随时都准备抓住马鞍架。可是他们突然注意到一件事，其余的都不顾了：第九排的第一名骑士是个很漂亮的小伙子，身材瘦削，开始大家没认出他是谁。很快，有人发出愤怒的喊叫，有人惊讶得说不出话来，出现了普遍的轰动。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The onlookers recognised in this young  man, riding one of M. Valenod's Norman horses, young Sorel, the carpenter's  son.There was one unanimous outcry against the Mayor, especially among the  Liberals. What, because this young labourer dressed up as a priest was tutor to  his brats, he had the audacity to appoint him to the Guard of Honour, to the  exclusion of M. This and M. That, wealthy manufacturers! 'Those gentlemen,'  said a banker's wife, 'ought really to offer an affront to the little upstart,  born in the gutter.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>人们认出这个骑在瓦勒诺先生的诺曼底马上的年轻人就是小索莱尔，木匠的儿子。大家齐声谴责市长，特别是那些自由党人。怎么，这个装扮成神甫的小工人做了他的小崽子们的家庭教师，他就敢把他选作仪仗队员，而把某某先生和某某先生排除在外，这些人可都是有钱的制造商啊！“这些先生，”一位银行家的太太说，“应该当众羞辱一番这个粪堆里出生的、傲慢无礼的小东西。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  has a wicked temper and he is wearing a sabre,' replied her companion; 'he  would be quite treacherous enough to slash them across the face.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“他很阴险，而且带着刀，”旁边一个男人说，“得提防着点，他会拿刀砍他们的脸的。”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  comments made by the aristocratic element were more dangerous. The ladies asked  themselves whether the Mayor alone was responsible for this grave breach of  etiquette. On the whole justice was done to his contempt for humble birth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>贵族圈子里的议论更危险。太太们寻思，这种极端的失礼是不是市长一个人的事。一般来说，他们还是承认他对出身不好是蔑视的。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While  he was giving rise to so much comment, Julien was the happiest man alive. Bold  by nature, he had a better seat on a horse than most of the young men of this  mountain town. He saw in the eyes of the women that they were talking about  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连引起纷纷议论之际，正是他感到最为幸福之时。他生来胆子大，骑在马上比这座山城大部分年轻人都来得好。他从女人们的眼睛里看  出她们说的是他。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  epaulettes were more brilliant because they were new. At every moment his horse  threatened to rear; he was in the seventh heaven of joy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的肩章比别人的亮，因为是新的。他的马每每直立，他达到了快乐的顶点。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  happiness knew no bounds when, as they passed near the old rampart, the sound  of the small cannon made his horse swerve out of the ranks. By the greatest  accident, he did not fall off; from that moment he felt himself a hero. He was  Napoleon's orderly officer and was charging a battery.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>行至古城墙附近，那门小炮的响声惊了马，马出了列，这时他的幸福简直没了边儿了。大出意外，他竟没有摔下来，他从此觉得自己是个  英雄。他是拿破仑的副官，正向敌人的炮兵阵地冲锋。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  was one person happier than he. First of all she had watched him pass from one  of the windows of the town hall; then, getting into her carriage, and rapidly  making a wide detour, she was in time to tremble when his horse carried him out  of the ranks. Finally, her carriage passing out at a gallop through another of  the gates of the town, she made her way back to the road along which the King  was to pass, and was able to follow the Guard of Honour at a distance of twenty  paces, in a noble cloud of dust. Ten thousand peasants shouted: 'Long live the  King' when the Mayor had the honour of addressing His Majesty. An hour  later,when, having listened to all the speeches, the King was about to enter  the town, the small cannon began to fire again with frenzied haste. But an  accident occurred, not to the gunners who had learned their trade at Leipsic  and Montmirail, but to the future Principal Deputy, M. de Moirod. His horse  dropped him gently into the one puddle to be found along the whole road, which  created a scandal, because he had to be pulled out of the way to enable the  King's carriage to pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一个人比他更幸福。她先是从市政厅的一个窗口看见他经过，然后登上敞篷四轮马车，飞快地绕个大弯儿，于连的马出列时，她正赶到，吓得一阵哆嗦。最后，她的马车出另一座城门，一路飞奔，赶到国王要经过的大路上，在二十步外，裹在一片高贵的尘土中，跟着仪仗队。市长荣幸地向陛下致词，一万农民高呼：“国王万岁！”一小时之后，国王听完所有的致词要进城了，那门小炮又开始急速发射。可是紧接着出事了，出事的不是那些在莱比锡和蒙米拉伊经受过考验的炮手们，而是未来的市长第一助理德·穆瓦罗先生。他的马把他轻轻地搁进了大路上仅有的一个泥坑里，一片混乱由此而起，因为必须把他从泥坑里拉出来，好让国王的车子通过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  Majesty alighted at the fine new church, which was decked out for the occasion  with all its crimson hangings. The King was to halt for dinner, immediately  after which he would take the road again to go and venerate the famous relic of  Saint Clement. No sooner was the King in side the church than Julien went off  at a gallop to M. de Renal's. There he discarded with a sigh his fine sky-blue  coat, his sabre, his epaulettes, to resume the little threadbare black coat. He  mounted his horse again, and in a few minutes was at BrayleHaut, which stands  on the summit of an imposing hill. 'Enthusiasm is multiplying these peasants,'  thought Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>国王陛下在美丽的新教堂下车，这一天教堂把它所有的深红色幔帐都挂上了。国王要用晚餐，餐毕立即登车去瞻仰圣克雷芒的遗骨，国王一到教堂，于连就飞马奔向德·莱纳先生的府邸。在那儿，他叹着气换下那漂亮的天蓝色制服、刀和肩章，穿上已经磨损的小黑衣服。他又骑上马，不一刻便到了座落在一座极美丽的小丘顶上的博莱—勒欧。“狂热使这些农民的人数越来越多了，”于连想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  cannot move at Verrieres, and here there are more than ten thousand of them  round this old abbey.' Half ruined by the vandalism of the Revolution, it had  been magnificently restored since the Restoration, and there was already some  talk of miracles. Julien joined the abbe Chelan,who scolded him severely, and  gave him a cassock and surplice. He vested himself hurriedly in these and  followed M. Chelan, who was going in search of the youthful Bishop of Agde.  This was a nephew of M. de La Mole, recently appointed to the See, who had been  selected to exhibit the relic to the King. But the Bishop was not to be found.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“维里埃挤得寸步难行，这座古老的修道院周围也有一万多人。”修道院有一半毁于革命时期对文物的破坏，复辟后重新修复，显得更加壮丽，而且人们已经开始谈论奇迹了。于连找到谢朗神甫，神甫狠狠责备了他一顿，交给他一件黑道袍和一件白法衣。他急忙穿上，跟着谢朗先生去见年轻的阿格德主教。这主教是德·拉莫尔先生的一个侄儿，新近才任命，负责带领国王瞻仰遗骨。可是到处也找不到这位主教。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  clergy were growing impatient. They awaited their leader in the sombre, gothic  cloister of the ancient abbey. Four and twenty parish priests had been  collected to represent the original chapter?  of Brayle Haut which prior to 1789 had consisted of four and twenty  canons. Having spent three quarters of an hour in deploring the youthfulness of  the Bishop, the priests decided that it would be a good thing if their Dean  were to go and inform His Lordship that the King was on his way, and that it was  time they were in the choir. M. Chelan's great age had made him Dean; despite  the anger he showed with Julien, he made a sign to him to follow him. Julien  carried his surplice admirably. By some secret process of the ecclesiastical  toilet-table, he had made his fine curly hair lie quite flat; but, by an  oversight which intensified the anger of M.Chelan, beneath the long folds of  his cassock one could see the spurs of the Guard of Honour.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>教士们等得不耐烦了。他们在旧修道院阴暗的、哥特式的回廊里等着他们的首领。一共召集了二十四位本堂神甫，用来代表一七八九年以前由二十四位议事司铎组成的博莱—勒欧的教务会。主教的年轻让本堂神甫们慨叹了三刻钟，然后他们想应该让教长先生先去找主教大人，提醒他国王即将驾到，是到祭坛去的时候了。谢朗先生的高龄使他成为教长，他虽然还在生于连的气，还是示意他跟上。于连的法衣非常合身。我不知道他用了什么样的教士梳理方法，他那—头美丽的卷发居然变得又平又直；可是由于一时疏忽，他那道袍的长褶下面露出了仪仗队员的马刺，这使谢朗先生更加恼怒。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  they reached the Bishop's apartment, the tall lackeys smothered in gold lace  barely condescended to inform the old cure that His Lordship could not be seen.  They laughed at him when he tried to explain that in his capacity as Dean of  the Noble chapter? of BrayleHaut, it was  his privilege to be admitted at all times to the presence of the officiating  Bishop.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>到了主教的套房，几个身材高大、打扮得花里胡哨的仆从爱搭不理地回答老本堂神甫，主教大人不见客。他想解释一下，作为博莱—勒欧的尊贵的教务会的教长，他有特权随时面见负责主祭的主教，可他们根本不当回事儿。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  proud spirit was offended by the insolence of the lackeys. He set off on a tour  of the dormitories of the old abbey, trying every door that he came to. One  quite small door yielded to his efforts and he found himself in a cell in the  midst of His Lordship's body-servants, dressed in black with chains round their  necks. Seeing his air of haste, these gentlemen supposed that the Bishop had  sent for him and allowed him to pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>仆从的无礼激起了于连的傲气。他开始沿老修道院的宿舍一间间地跑，遇门便推。有一扇很小的门，他一使劲，开了。他进了一个小房间，里面有几位身着黑衣、脖子上挂着链子的主教大人的随身仆人，这些先生们见他神色匆匆，以为是主教叫来的，就放他过去。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  went a little way and found himself in an immense gothic chamber, very dark and  panelled throughout in black oak; with a single exception, its pointed windows  had been walled up with bricks. There was nothing to conceal the coarse surface  of this masonry, which formed a sorry contrast to the venerable splendour of  the woodwork. Both sides of this room, famous among the antiquarians of  Burgundy, which the Duke Charles the Bold built about the year 1470 in  expiation of some offence, were lined with wooden stalls, richly carved. These displayed,  inlaid in wood of different colours, all the mysteries of the Apocalypse.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他走了几步，进入一间哥特式大厅，厅内极阴暗，墙上全铺着黑色橡木的护壁板；尖拱形的窗户，除了一扇之外，全部用砖头堵死。砖砌得很粗糙，没有一点遮掩，与护壁板的古色古香形成可悲的对比。这间大厅在勃艮第的考古学家中很有名，它是大胆夏尔公爵于一四七０年为了赎一桩什么罪而修建的，它的宽大的两侧布满雕刻精细的木质神职祷告席。那上面还可以后到用各种颜色的木头镶嵌的图画，表现出《启示录》中所有神秘的事情。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  melancholy splendour, degraded by the intrusion of the bare bricks and white  plaster, impressed Julien. He stood there in silence. At the other end of the  room, near the only window through which any light came, he saw a portable  mirror framed in mahogany. A young man, robed in violet with a lace surplice,  but bareheaded, was standing three paces away from the mirror. This article  appeared out of place in such a room, and had doubtless been brought there from  the town. Julien thought that the young man seemed irritated; with his right  hand he was gravely giving benedictions in the direction of the mirror.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>裸露的砖，依旧很白的灰，破坏了大厅的富丽，令人伤感，深深地触动了于连。他默默地站住了。大厅的另一端，唯一的一扇漏进光线的窗子旁，他看见一架桃花心木框的活动镜子。一个年轻人，身着紫袍和镶花边的白法衣，但光着头，站在离镜子三步远的地方。这家具出现在这样的地方，显得很怪，无疑是从城里运来的。于连发现这个年轻人面有愠色，他用右手朝着镜子的方向庄严地做着降福的动作。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  can this mean?' he wondered. 'Is it a preliminary ceremony that this young  priest is performing? He is perhaps the Bishop's secretary…he will be rude like  the lackeys … but what of that, let us try him.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>“这能说明什么？”于连想，“这年轻人是在为仪式作准备吗？也许是主教的秘书……他会像那些仆从一样无礼的……我的天，管它呢，让我来试试。”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  went forward and passed slowly down the length of the room, keeping his eyes  fixed on that solitary window and watching the young man who continued to give  benedictions, with a slow motion but in end less profusion, and without pausing  for a moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>他向前走去，从这头到那头，走得相当慢，眼睛盯着那扇唯一的窗户，同时望着那个年轻人。这年轻人继续降福。动作很慢，但次数多得没个完，而且一刻也不停。</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  he drew nearer he was better able to see the other's look of annoyance. The  costliness of his lace-bordered surplice brought Julien to a standstill some  distance away from the magnificent mirror.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他越来越近，更加看清了他那不悦的脸色。饰有花边的法衣很华丽，于连不由自主地在距离那面豪华的镜子几步远的地方停住了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is my duty to speak,' he reminded himself at length; but the beauty of the room  had touched his feelings and he was chilled in anticipation by the harsh words  that would be addressed to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我有责任说话，”他终于对自已说；然而大厅的美丽使他心情激动，他已经事先对人家将对他说的粗暴的话感到气愤了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  young man caught sight of him in the glass, turned round, and suddenly  discarding his look of irritation said to him in the pleasantest tone:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>年轻人在镜子里看见他，转过身，不悦的脸色立刻变了，以最温和的口气对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well,  Sir, is it ready yet?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊，先生，终于把它弄好了吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  remained speechless. As this young man turned towards him,Julien saw the  pectoral cross on his breast: it was the Bishop of Agde. 'So young,' thought  Julien; 'at the most, only six or eight years older thanmyself!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连大吃一惊。这年轻人朝他转过身的那当儿，于连看见了挂在他胸前的十字架：原来他就是阿格德主教。“这么年轻，”于连想：“顶  多比我大六岁或八岁……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  he felt ashamed of his spurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他为他的马刺感到差愧。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monseigneur,'  he replied timidly. 'I am sent by the Dean of the chapter , M. Chelan.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“主教大人，”他畏畏缩缩地回答道，“我是教务会的教长谢朗先生派来的。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  I have an excellent account of him,' said the bishop in a courteous tone which  left Julien more fascinated than ever. 'But I beg your pardon,Sir, I took you  for the person who is to bring me back my mitre. It was carelessly packed in  Paris; the silver tissue has been dreadfully frayed at the top. It will create  a shocking effect,' the young Bishop went on with a sorrowful air, 'and they  are keeping me waiting too.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“啊！有人向我大力举荐过他，”主教说，客客气气的口吻使于连喜出望外。“不过我得请您原谅，先生，我把您当成应该把主教冠送回  来的那个人了。在巴黎时没有包装好，上面的银丝纱网损坏得很历害。那会给人留下极糟糕的印象，”年轻的主教愁眉不展地说，“他们还让我在这儿等着！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Monseigneur,  I shall go and find the mitre, with Your Lordship's permission.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“大人，我去找主教冠，如果阁下允许的话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  fine eyes had their effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的漂亮眼睛产生了效果。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Go,  Sir,' the Bishop answered with exquisite courtesy; 'I must have it at once. I  am sorry to keep the gentlemen of the chapter?  waiting.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“去吧，先生，”主教彬彬有礼地答道，“我立刻就要。让教务会的先生们等着，我很抱歉。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  Julien was halfway down the room, he turned to look at the Bishop and saw that  he was once more engaged in giving benedictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当于连走到大厅中央的时候，回头看了看，主教又开始降福了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  can that be?' Julien asked himself; 'no doubt, it is a religious preparation  necessary to the ceremony that is to follow.' When he came to the cell in which  the servants were waiting, he saw the mitre in their hands. These gentlemen,  yielding in spite of themselves to Julien's imperious glance, surrendered it to  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“这是什么意思？”于连想，“这大概是教士在将要开始的仪式前的一种  必要的准备吧。”他走进随身仆人们的那个小房间，看见主教冠正在他们手中。这些先生们见于连目光专断，不由自主地把主教冠交给了他。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  felt proud to be carrying it: as he crossed the room, he walked slowly; he held  it with respect. He found the Bishop seated before the glass; but, from time to  time, his right hand, tired as it was, still gave the benediction. Julien  helped him to put on the mitre. The Bishop shook his head.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他能送主教冠，颇感自豪，穿越大厅时，他放慢了脚步，毕恭毕敬地捧着。他看见主教坐在镜子前，可是右手还不顾疲劳，时不时地做着降福的动作。于连帮助他把冠戴上。主教晃了晃脑袋。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  It will keep on,' he said to Julien with a satisfied air. 'Will you go a little  way off?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

</div>
<p>“啊，很稳，”他对于连说，看来很满意。“您站得稍远一点，好吗？</p>
</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Whereupon  the Bishop walked at a smart pace to the middle of the room, then returning  towards the mirror with a slow step, he resumed his air of irritation and went  on solemnly giving benedictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教这时快步走到大厅中央，然后慢慢地走近镜子，又作出生气的样子，开始庄严地降福。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was spell-bound with astonishment; he was tempted to guess what this meant, but  did not dare. The Bishop stopped, and looking at him with an air from which the  solemnity rapidly vanished:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连惊奇得一动不动，他真想弄明白，可是不敢。主教站住了，望着他，神情很快缓和下来：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  do you say to my mitre, Sir, does it look right?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您觉得我的冠如何，先生？合适吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Quite  right, Monseigneur.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“非常合适，大人。”</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is not too far back? That would look rather silly; but it does not do, either,  to wear them pulled down over one's eyes like an officer's shako.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“不太朝后吗？太朝后会显得傻乎乎的；不过也不应该太低，压在眼睛上，像军官的筒帽。”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  seems to me to be quite right.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我觉得非常合适。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  King of —— is accustomed to venerable clergy who are doubtless very solemn. I  should not like, especially in view of my age, to appear too frivolous.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“国王见惯了德高望重当然也是非常严肃的教士。我不想，特别是由于我的年龄，显得过于轻浮。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  the Bishop once more began to walk about the room scattering benedictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教说着又开始走动，一边做着降福的动作。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is quite clear,' said Julien, at last venturing to understand, 'he is  practising the benediction.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“现在清楚了，”于连终于明白，“他是在练习降福的动作。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  few moments later: 'I am ready,' said the Bishop. 'Go, Sir, and inform the Dean  and the gentlemen of the chapter .' </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>过了一会儿，主教说：“我准备好了。先生，去通知教长先生和教务会的先生们吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Presently  M. Chelan, followed by the two oldest of the cures, entered by an immense door,  magnificently carved, which Julien had not noticed. But this time he remained  in his place in the extreme rear, and could see the Bishop only over the  shoulders of the ecclesiastics who crowded towards this door.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>很快，谢朗先生带着两位最年长的本堂神甫从一扇雕刻华美的很大的门进来，这扇门于连竟没有看见。这一回，于连呆在他的位置上，即  最后一个；教士们挤在门口，他只能越过他们的肩膀看见主教。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Bishop crossed the room slowly; when he came to the threshold the cures formed  in processional order. After a momentary confusion the procession began to  move, intoning a psalm. The Bishop came last, between M. Chelan and another  cure of great age. Julien found a place for himself quite close to His  Lordship, as being attached to the abbe Chelan. They moved down the long  corridors of the abbey of Brayle Haut; in spite of the brilliant sunshine,  these were dark and damp. At length they arrived at the door of the cloister.  Julien was speechless with admiration of so fine a ceremony. His heart was  divided between the ambition aroused by the Bishop's youthfulness, and the  sensibility and exquisite manners of this prelate. His courtesy was of a very  different kind from M. de Renal's, even on his good days. 'The  more one rises towards the highest rank of society,' thought Julien, 'the more  one finds these charming manners.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教缓步穿过大厅；他行至门口时，本堂神甫们正在排仪式队伍。一阵短时间的混乱，仪式队伍开始唱着圣诗行进。主教走在最后，夹在谢朗先生和一位很老的本堂神甫中间。于连作为谢朗神甫的助手，紧贴着主教大人。队伍沿着博莱－勒欧修道院那些长长的走廊行进，外面阳光灿烂、走廊里仍旧阴暗潮湿，终于到了内院门口的柱底下。如此壮丽的仪式使于连赞叹不己，直发愣。主教的年轻所激起的野心，这位高级神职人员的敏感和温文尔雅，互相争夺着于连的心。这种礼貌与德·莱纳先生的完全不同，包括他心情好的时候。“越是靠近社会的最上层，”于连心里说，“越是能遇到这种迷人的风度。”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p> They entered the church by a side door;  suddenly an appalling crash made its ancient vaults resound; Julien thought  that the walls were collapsing. It was again the small cannon; drawn by eight  horses at a gallop, it had just arrived; and immediately on its arrival,  brought into action by the gunners of Leipsic, it was firing five rounds a  minute, as though the Prussians had been in front of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>队伍从边门进入教堂，突然，一声可怕的巨响震得古老的拱顶发出回声；于连以为拱顶坍了。还是那门小炮，八匹奔马拖着，刚刚到达，莱比锡的炮手们迅即架好，每分钟五响，仿佛前面是普鲁士人。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  this stirring sound no longer had any effect upon Julien, he dreamed no more of  Napoleon and martial glory. 'So young,' he was thinking, 'to be Bishop of Agde!  But where is Agde? And how much is it worth? Two or three hundred thousand  francs, perhaps.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>不过，这令人赞叹的巨响对于连已不再起作用，他不再想拿破仑，不再想从军的荣耀了。“这么年轻就当了阿格德的主教！”于连想，“可阿格德在哪儿？能有多少收入？也许有二、三十万法郎吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  Lordship's servants appeared, carrying a magnificent dais; M. Chelan took one  of the poles, but actually it was Julien that bore it. The Bishop took his  place beneath it. He had really succeeded in giving himself the air of an old  man; our hero's admiration knew no bounds. 'What cannot one do if one is  clever!' he thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教大人的仆从们带着一顶富丽堂皇的华盖来了，谢朗先生举着其中的一根竿子，实际上是于连替他举着。主教站在下面。真的，他果然使自己显出一副老相；我们的主人公简直佩服得五体投地。“机灵真是无所不能啊！”他想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  King made his entry. Julien was so fortunate as to see him at close range. The  Bishop addressed him with unction, and did not forget to include a slight touch  of confusion, extremely flattering to His Majesty. </p>

<p>We shall not repeat the  account of the ceremonies at BrayleHaut; for a fortnight they filled the  columns of all the newspapers of the Department. Julien learned, from the Bishop's  speech, that the King was descended from Charles the Bold.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>国王进来了。于连有福气，能够就近看到他。主教满怀热忱地向国王致词，同时没有忘记带点儿面对陛下的那种极为得体的诚惶诚恐。</p>

<p>我们不重复那些有关博莱—勒欧的仪式的描绘了，一连半个月全省各报的篇幅都被它占满了。于连从主教的致词中得知，国王乃大胆查理之后。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Later  on it was one of Julien's duties to check the accounts of what this ceremony  had cost. M. de La Mole, who had secured a bishopric for his nephew, had chosen  to pay him the compliment of bearing the whole of the expense himself. The  ceremony at BrayleHaut alone cost three thousand eight hundred francs.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">




<p>后来，于连的职责之一就是核对这次仪式费用的帐目。德·拉莫尔先生为他的侄儿谋到一个主教职位，为了表示大方，就承担了全部费用。单单博莱—勒欧的宗教仪式就花费了三千八百法郎。</p>
</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  the Bishop's address and the King's reply, His Majesty took his place beneath  the dais; he then knelt down most devoutly upon a cushion close to the altar.  The choir was enclosed with stalls, and these stalls were raised two steps  above the pavement. It was on the second of these steps that Julien sat at the  feet of M. Chelan, not unlike a trainbearer at the feet of his Cardinal, in the  Sistine Chapel, in Rome. There were a Te Deum, clouds of incense, endless  volleys of musketry and artillery; the peasants were frantic with joy and  piety. Such a day undoes the work of a hundred numbers of the Jacobin papers.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>主教致词和国王答词之后，国王陛下站到华盖下，极虔诚地跪在祭坛旁的一张垫子上。祭台同围是高出地面两个台阶的神职祷告席。于连坐在台阶的第二级上，在谢朗先生脚旁，差不多像罗马西斯廷教堂①中拉长袍后据的人靠近红衣主教一样。有感恩赞美诗，有缭绕的香烟，有频频发射的火枪火炮，农民们陶醉在幸福和虔诚之中。这样的—天足以毁掉雅各宾派的报纸一百期的工作。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was within six paces of the King, who was praying with genuine fervour. He  noticed for the first time a small man of intelligent appearance, whose coat  was almost bare of embroidery. But he wore a sky-blue riband over this  extremely simple coat. He was nearer to the King than many other gentlemen,  whose coats were so covered with gold lace that, to use Julien's expression,  one could not see the cloth. He learned a minute later that this was M. de La  Mole. He decided that he wore a haughty, indeed an insolent air.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连离国王六步远，国王确实在诚心诚意地祈祷。他第一次注意到一个人，身材矮小，目光敏慧，穿着一件几乎没有绣花的衣服。不过这件很朴素的衣服上有一枚天蓝色缓带。他比许多贵人离国王都近，而那些贵人的衣服上绣了那么多金线，用于连的说法，连料子都看不见了。过了一会儿，他知道那人就是德·拉莫尔先生。他觉得他神情高傲，甚至蛮横无礼。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  Marquis would not be polite like my dear Bishop,' he thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这位侯爵不会像我那漂亮主教一样有礼貌，”他想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!  The career of a churchman makes one gentle and wise. But the King has come to  venerate the relic, and I see no relic. Where can Saint Clement be?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“啊，教士的身份使人温和又聪明。不过国王是来瞻仰遗骨的，可我看不见遗骨。丝克雷芒在哪儿呢？”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  little clerk, who was next to him, informed him that the venerable relic was in  the upper part of the building, in a chapelle ardente.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>身旁的一个小教士告诉他，可敬的遗骨放在这个建筑物高处的一个火焰殿里。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  is a chapelle ardente?' Julien asked himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“火焰殿是什么？”于连想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  he would not ask for an explanation of the words. He followed the proceedings with  even closer attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而他不想多问。他的注意力更加集中了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  the occasion of a visit from a sovereign prince, etiquette requires that the  canons shall not accompany the Bishop. But as he started for the chapelle  ardente His Lordship of Agde summoned the abbe Chelan; Julien ventured to follow  him. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在君王参拜的时候，按照礼节规定，议事司烽不陪伴主教。可是在向火焰败走去的时候，阿格德主教大人叫上了谢朗神甫，于连大着胆子  跟了上去。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  climbing a long stair, they came to a very small door, the frame of which was  sumptuously gilded. This work had a look of having just been completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>登上一段很长的楼梯之后，他们来到一扇门前，门极小，但哥特式的门框涂得流金溢彩，看上去仿佛昨天才完工。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Outside  the door were gathered on their knees four and twenty girls, belonging to the  most distinguished families of Verrieres. Before opening the door, the Bishop  sank on his knees in the midst of these girls, who were all pretty. While he  was praying aloud, it seemed as though they could not sufficiently admire his  fine lace, his charm, his young and pleasant face. This spectacle made our hero  lose all that remained of his reason. At that moment, he would have fought for  the Inquisition, and in earnest. Suddenly the door flew open. The little chapel  seemed to be ablaze with light. One saw upon the altar more than a thousand  candles arranged in eight rows, separated from one another by clusters of  flowers. The sweet odour of the purest incense rose in clouds from the gate of  the sanctuary. The newly gilded chapel was quite small, but very lofty. Julien  noticed that there were on the altar candles more than fifteen feet long. The  girls could not restrain a cry of admiration. No one had been admitted to the  tiny antechapel save the twenty-four girls, the two priests and Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>门前跪着二十四位少女，她们都来自维里埃最显贵的家庭。开门之前，主教先跪在这些个个都很漂亮的姑娘中间。他高声祷告的时候，她  们欣赏着他的美丽的花边、温文尔雅的风采、如此年轻又如此温和的面孔，好像没个够。这场面让我们的主人公那仅存的一点理智丧失殆尽。这时，他可以为宗教裁判去战斗，而且出自真心实意。突然，门开了。小小的殿堂一片光明、如在火中。祭台上可以看见一千多枝蜡烛，分成八排，中间用花束隔开。质地最纯的乳香散发出好闻的香气，一团团从圣殿的门口涌出。新涂了金的殿堂极小，但是位置很高。于连注意到祭台上的蜡烛高过十五尺。少女们禁不住发出赞叹的叫声。殿堂的小门厅里只准这二十四位少女、两位本堂神甫和于连进去。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Presently  the King arrived, followed only by M. de La Mole and his Great Chamberlain. The  guards themselves remained outside, on their knees, presenting their arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>很快，国王到了，身后跟着德·拉莫尔先生和侍从长。侍卫们都留在外面，跪在地上，同时举起武器致敬。</p>

</div></div>

<p>His  Majesty flung himself rather than knelt down on the faldstool. It was then only  that Julien, pressed against the gilded door, caught sight, beneath a girl's  bare arm, of the charming statue of Saint Clement. It was hidden beneath the  altar, in the garb of a young Roman soldier. He had in his throat a large wound  from which the blood seemed to be flowing.The  artist had surpassed himself; the eyes, dying but full of grace, were half  closed. A budding moustache adorned the charming mouth, which being slightly  open had the effect of being still engaged in prayer. At the sight of this  statue, the girl nearest to Julien wept hot tears; one of her tears fell upon  Julien's hand.</p>

<p>国王陛下快步上前，简直是扑倒在跪凳上。于连紧贴在涂金的门上，只是在这时才通过一位姑娘的裸臂下看见可爱的圣克雷芒雕像。他藏  在祭台底下，身着年轻的罗马士兵的服装。脖子上有一道很大的伤口，好像在流血。垂死的眼睛半闭着，但是很美；艺术家使出了浑身解数。初生的唇髭，一张迷人的嘴半张着，好像还在祈祷。于连身边的一位姑娘见状不禁热泪盈眶，一滴泪落在于连的手上。</p>

<p>After  an interval of prayer in the most profound silence, disturbed only by the  distant sound of the bells of all the villages within a radius of ten leagues,  the Bishop of Agde asked the King's permission to speak. He concluded a brief  but highly edifying discourse with these words, simple in themselves, but  thereby all the better assured of their effect.</p>

<p>万籍俱寂，无比深沉，只有遥远的钟声从方圆十法里内的村庄传来。祈祷了一会儿，阿格德主教方才请求国王准许他讲话。他的讲话短而动人，结尾的几句话很简单，但效果反而更好。</p>

<p>'Never forget, young Christian women, that  you have seen one of the great Kings of the earth upon his knees before the  servants of this all powerful and terrible God. These servants, frail,  persecuted, martyred upon earth, as you can see from the still bleeding wound  of Saint Clement, are triumphant in heaven. All your lives, I think, young  Christians, you will remember this day. You will detest impiety. Always you  will remain faithful to this God who is so great, so terrible, but so good.'</p>

<p>“永远不要忘记，年轻的女基督徒们，你们看见了尘世上最伟大的国王之一跪倒在万能而可怕的天主的这些仆人面前。正如你们从圣克雷芒的还在流血的伤口中看到的那样，这些仆人是弱小的，在尘世间受到折磨和杀害，然而他们在天上得到了胜利。年轻的女基督徒们，你们将永远记住这一天，是不是？你们要憎恨亵渎宗教的人。你们要永远忠于这位如此伟大、如此可怕、然而如此仁慈的天主啊。”</p>

<p>At  these words, the Bishop rose with authority. 'You promise me?' he said,  extending his arm with an air of inspiration.</p>

<p>The  King himself was in tears. It was not until long afterwards that Julien was  calm enough to inquire where were the bones of the Saint, sent from Rome to  Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. He was told that they were embodied in the  charming wax figure.</p>

<p>M.  de La Mole ordered ten thousand bottles of wine to be distributed among the  peasants. That evening, at Verrieres, the Liberals found an excuse for  illuminating their houses a hundred times more brilliantly than the Royalists.  Before leaving the town, the King paid a visit to M. de Moirod.</p>
