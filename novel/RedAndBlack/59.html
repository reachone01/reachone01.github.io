  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>After  having read without pleasure at first Julien's long letters, Madame de  Fervaques began to take an interest in them; but one thing distressed her:  'What a pity that M. Sorel is not really a priest! One could admit him to a  sort of intimacy: with that Cross and what is almost a layman's coat, one is  exposed to cruel questions, and how is one to answer them?' She did not  complete her thought: 'some malicious friend may suppose and indeed spread the  report that he is some humble little cousin, one of my father's family, some  tradesman decorated by the National Guard.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·费瓦克夫人读于连的那些长信，初时并不感到快乐，可是渐渐地她开始上心了；但有一件事情令她不快：“多可惜，索莱尔先生并非真是个教士！否则就可以跟他建立某种亲密的关系了；有了这枚十字勋章和这身近乎市民的衣服，可要招来残酷的问题了，怎么回答呢？”她想不下去了，“某个狡猾的女友会猜疑，甚至散布说他是我娘家方面的小表弟，地位低下，是个得过国民自卫军的勋章的商人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Until  the moment of her first meeting Julien, Madame de Fervaques's greatest pleasure  had been to write the word Marechale before her own name. Thenceforward the  vanity of an upstart, morbid and easily offended, had to fight a nascent  interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>直到德·费瓦克夫人看见于连之前，她的乐趣一直是在自己的名字旁边写上元帅夫人这几个字。现在，一种暴发户病态的、动辄觉得受了冒犯的虚荣跟刚刚产生的兴趣展开了搏斗。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  would be so easy for me,' the Marechale said to herself, 'to make a  Vicar-General of him in some diocese not far from Paris! But M. Sorel by  itself, and to add to that a mere secretary of M. de La Mole! It is  deplorable.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“让他当上巴黎附近某个教区的代理主教，”元帅夫人对自己说，“在我是多么容易的事！可是索莱尔先生连个头衔也没有，还是德·拉莫尔先生的小秘书！真扫兴。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  the first time, this spirit which dreaded everything was stirred by an interest  apart from its own pretensions to rank and to social superiority.Her  old porter noticed that, when he brought her a letter from that handsome young  man, who wore such a melancholy air, he was certain to see vanish the  distracted and irritated expression which the Marechale always took care to  assume when any of her servants entered the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这颗什么都害怕的心第一次被一种与她对身份和优越的社会地位的追求无关的利益所打动。她的老门房注意到，他把那位神情如此忧郁的英俊的青年的信送来时，准能看见元帅夫人脸上的心不在焉和不满一下子消失，而那种神情她一见有下人来到总是立刻就挂在脸上的。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  boredom of a mode of life whose sole ambition was to create an effect on the  public, without there being at the bottom of her heart any real enjoyment of  this kind of success, had become so intolerable since she had begun to think of  Julien, that, if her maids were not to be ill-treated throughout the whole of a  day, it was enough that during the previous evening she should have spent an  hour with this strange young man. His growing credit survived anonymous  letters, very well composed. In vain did little Tanbeau supply MM. de Luz, de  Croisenois, de Caylus, with two or three most adroit calumnies which those  gentlemen took pleasure in spreading abroad, without stopping to consider the  truth of the accusations. The Marechale, whose mind was not framed to withstand  these vulgar methods, reported her doubts to Mathilde, and was always  comforted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这种一心渴望着哗众取宠的生活方式，即便有所成功也不能在内心深处引起实实在在的快乐，而它带未的烦闷，自她想念于连以来却变得不堪忍受了，只要头天晚上她与这个奇特的行轻人共同度过一个钟头，女仆们就能一整天不受虐待。他初步获得的信任己能顶住一些写得很巧妙的匿名信了。小唐博向德·吕兹先生、德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生、德·凯吕斯先生提供了两、三件巧妙的诽谤材料，但是徒劳，尽管这些先生乐于散布而不大问真假。元帅夫人的智力是顶不住这种庸俗的手段的，就把她的疑惑讲给玛蒂尔德听，并且总是能得到安慰。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  day, after having inquired three times whether there were any letters, Madame  de Fervaques suddenly decided to write to Julien. This was a victory gained by  boredom. At the second letter, the Marechale was almost brought to a standstill  by the unpleasantness of writing with her own hand so vulgar an address as: 'a  M. Sorel, chez M. le Marquis de La Mole'.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天，德·费瓦克夫人问了三次有无信来，就突然决定给于连回信。此乃烦恼的一次胜利。到了第二封信，她要亲手写上：德·拉莫尔府索莱尔先生收，这姓名地址太俗，有失身份，她几乎停笔不写了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  must,' she said to Julien that evening in the driest of tones, 'bring me some  envelopes with your address written on them.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您应该给我带几个信封来，”晚上她冷冷地对他说，“上面有您的姓名地址。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  now I am to combine the lover and the flunkey,' thought Julien,and bowed,  amusing himself by screwing up his face like Arsene, the Marquis's old footman.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我这是情夫男仆集于一身了，”于连想，他鞠了一个躬，高兴地装出一副老态，活像德·拉莫尔先生的老仆阿尔塞纳。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  same evening he brought a supply of envelopes, and next day, early in the  morning, he received a third letter: he read five or six lines at the  beginning, and two or three towards the end. It covered four pages in a small  and very close script.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当晚，他就送去几个信封；第二天一大早，他收到第三封信，他看了开头的五、六行和结尾的两、三行。信有四页，字很小，也很密。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Gradually  she formed the pleasant habit of writing almost every day.Julien  replied with faithful copies of the Russian letters, and, such is the advantage  of the emphatic style, Madame de Fervaques was not at all surprised by the want  of connection between the replies and her own letters.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>渐渐地，她养成了甜蜜的习惯，差不多每天都给他写信。于连的回信仍是俄国人的信的忠实抄件，这是夸张风格的一大好处：德·费瓦克  夫人对回信和她的信甚少关系丝毫不觉惊奇。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>What  would have been the irritation to her pride if little Tanbeau, who had  appointed himself a voluntary spy upon Julien's actions, had been able to tell  her that all these letters, with their seals unbroken, were flung pellmell into  Julien's drawer!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>小唐博自愿充当密探，监视于连的行动，他要是告诉她，那些信都原封未动，随手扔在了于连的抽屉里，她的自尊心会受到多大的伤害啊！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One morning, the porter brought to him in the  library a letter from theMarechale; Mathilde met the man, saw the letter, and  read the address in Julien's hand. She entered the library as the porter left  it; the letter was still lying on the edge of the table; Julien, busily engaged  in writing, had not placed it in his drawer.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天早晨，门房去图书室送一封元帅夫人的来信；玛蒂尔德碰上了，看见了信和于连亲笔写的地址。门房出来后，她进去了；信放在桌子边上；于连正忙着写东西，没有把信放进抽屉。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  is what I cannot endure,' cried Mathilde, seizing the letter; 'you are  forgetting me entirely, me who am your wife. Your conduct is appalling, Sir.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不能容忍这个，”玛蒂尔德抓起那封信，嚷道，“您把我完全忘了，我是您的妻子呀。您的行为真可怕，先生。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>With  these words, her pride, astonished by the fearful impropriety of her action,  stifled her; she burst into tears, and a moment later appeared to Julien to be  unable to breathe.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>说到这里，她的傲慢一下子被可怕的举止失当惊醒，使她说不出话来；她泪流满面，很快于连就觉得她喘不过气来了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Surprised,  confounded, Julien did not clearly distinguish all the admirable and happy  consequences which this scene foreboded for himself. He helped Mathilde to a  seat; she almost abandoned herself in his arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连惊讶，慌乱，竟看不出这一幕对他多么美妙，多么幸运。他扶玛蒂尔德坐下，她几乎倒在他怀里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  first instant in which he perceived this relaxation was one of extreme joy. His  second thought was of Korasoff: 'I may ruin everything by a single word.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>开始，他看到这一动作还感到大喜过望，紧接着，他想到了科拉索夫：“我可能因一句话而丧失一切。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  arms ached, so painful was the effort imposed on him by policy. 'I ought not  even to allow myself to press to my heart this supple and charming form, or she  will despise and abuse me. What a frightful nature!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的胳膊僵直了，策略迫使他做出的努力何其艰巨。“我甚至不能把这个柔软迷人的躯体贴紧我的心口，否则她会蔑视我，虐待我。多可  怕的性格！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  as he cursed Mathilde's nature, he loved her for it a hundred times more; he  felt as though he were holding a queen in his arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他一边诅咒玛蒂尔德的性格，一边更百倍地爱她，他觉得拥在怀里的是一位王后。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien's  unfeeling coldness intensified the misery of wounded pride which was tearing  the heart of Mademoiselle de La Mole. She was far from possessing the necessary  coolness to seek to read in his eyes what he was feeling for her at that  moment. She could not bring herself to look at him; she trembled lest she  should meet an expression of scorn.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐的自尊受到伤害，深感不幸撕扯着她的心灵，于连无动于衷的冷淡更加剧了她的不幸。她太不冷静，想不到从他的眼睛里  看看他此刻对她是什么感情。她下不了决心朝他看，她怕遇到轻蔑的表情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Seated  on the divan in the library, motionless and with her head turned away from  Julien, she was a prey to the keenest suffering that pride and love can make a  human heart feel. Into what a frightful course of action had she fallen!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她坐在图书室的长沙发上，纹丝不动，头转过去背着于连，正受着自尊和爱情可能使一个人的灵魂感受到的痛苦折磨。她刚才的举动多可怕，羞死人了！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  was reserved for me, wretch that I am, to see the most indelicate advances  repulsed! And repulsed by whom?' added a pride mad with suffering, 'by one of  my father's servants.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我多么不幸啊！我活该看见自己最有失身份的奉迎遭到拒绝！而且遭到谁的拒绝？”她的自尊痛苦得发了狂，“我父亲的一个仆人！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is what I will not endure,' she said aloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不能容忍这个”，她大声说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And,  rising with fury, she opened the drawer of Julien's table, which stood a few  feet away from her. She remained frozen with horror on seeing there nine or ten  letters unopened, similar in every respect to the letter which the porter had  just brought in. On all the envelopes, she recognised Julien's hand, more or  less disguised.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她狂怒地站起来，前面两步远就是于连的书桌，她拉开抽屉。她惊呆了，眼前八、九封没有拆开的信，和门房刚送来的那一封完全一样。  她认出姓名地址都是于连的笔迹，多少有些变换。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  so,' she cried, beside herself with rage, 'not only have you found favour with  her, but you despise her. You, a man of nought, to despise Madame la Marechale  de Fervaques!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这么说，”她怒不可遏，叫起来，“您不仅仅跟她好，您还蔑视她。您，一个微不足道的人，居然蔑视德·费瓦克元帅夫人！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah,  forgive me, my dear,' she went on, flinging herself at his feet,'despise me if  you wish, but love me, I can no longer live deprived of your love.' And she  fell to the ground in a dead faint.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！宽恕我，我的朋友，”她一下子跪倒，说，“如果你愿意，就蔑视我吧，但是要爱我啊，没有你的爱情我活不了了。”她真地昏过  去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  there she is, that proud creature, at my feet!' thought Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个骄傲的女人，终于跪倒在我的脚下了！”于连心里说。
