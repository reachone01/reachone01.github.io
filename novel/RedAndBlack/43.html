  <div class="left"><p>On  the following day he again surprised Norbert and his sister, who were talking  about him. On his arrival, a deathly silence fell, as on the day before. His  suspicions knew no bounds. 'Can these charming young people be planning to make  a fool of me? I must own, that is far more probable, far more natural than a  pretended passion on the part of Mademoiselle de La Mole, for a poor devil of a  secretary. For one thing, do these people have passions? Mystification is their  specialty. They are jealous of my wretched little superiority in language.  Being jealous, that is another of their weaknesses. That explains everything.  Mademoiselle de La Mole hopes to persuade me that she is singling me out,  simply to offer me as a spectacle to her intended.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>第二天，他又撞见诺贝尔和她妹妹正在谈论他。他一到，又是像昨天一样，一片死一般的沉默。他的疑心没了边际。“这些可爱的年轻人是在想办法嘲弄我吗？应该承认，这比德·拉莫尔小姐对一个穷秘书的所谓激情要可能得多，自然得多。首先，这些人能有激情吗？愚弄是他们的拿手好戏。他们嫉妒我那点可怜的口才。善妒又是他们的弱点之一。他们那一套完全可以这样解释。德·拉莫尔小姐想让我相信她看中了我，仅仅是为了让我在她的未婚夫面前出丑。”</p>

<p>This  cruel suspicion completely changed Julien's moral attitude. The idea  encountered in his heart a germ of love which it had no difficulty in  destroying. This love was founded only upon Mathilde's rare beauty, or rather  upon her regal manner and her admirable style in dress. In this respect Julien  was still an upstart. A beautiful woman of fashion is, we are assured, the  sight that most astonishes a clever man of peasant origin when he arrives amid  the higher ranks of society. It was certainly not Mathilde's character that had  set Julien dreaming for days past. He had enough sense to grasp that he knew  nothing about her character.Everything  that he saw of it might be only a pretence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一残忍的怀疑完全改变了于连的精神状态。这个念头在他心中发现了爱情的萌芽，轻而易举地把它扼杀了。这种爱情仅仅建立在玛蒂尔德罕见的美貌上，或者更建立在她王后般的举止和令人赞叹的打扮上。就这一点而言，于连还是个暴发户。可以肯定地说，一个聪明的乡下人攀上社会上层，最使他感到惊异的莫过于贵旅社会的漂亮女人了。使于连前几天想入非非的，根本不是玛蒂尔德的性格。他有足够的理智，知道自己还不了解这种性格。他所看到的可能只是一种表象。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For instance, Mathilde would not  for anything in the world have failed to hear mass on a Sunday; almost every  day she went to church with her mother. If, in the drawing-room of the Hotel de  La Mole, some impudent fellow forgot where he was and allowed himself to make  the remotest allusion to some jest aimed at the real or supposed interests of  Throne or Altar, Mathilde would at once assume an icy severity. Her glance,  which was so sparkling, took on all the expressionless pride of an old family  portrait.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>例如，玛蒂尔德无论如何也不会错过礼拜天的弥撒的，几乎每天都要陪母亲去教堂。如果在德·拉莫尔府的客厅里，有人冒冒失失，忘了他是在什么地方，敢胆哪怕最间接地影射一个针对王座或祭坛的真实或假想利益的笑话，玛蒂尔德立刻就变得冰一样地严肃。她那如此尖利的目光也流露出一种彻底的、无情的高傲，像她们家里一幅古老的肖像上的那种目光一样。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  Julien knew for certain that she always had in her room one or two of the most  philosophical works of Voltaire. He himself frequently abstracted a volume or  two of the handsome edition so magnificently bound. By slightly separating the  other volumes on the shelf, he concealed the absence of the volume he was  taking away; but soon he discovered that someone else was reading Voltaire. He  had recourse to a trick of the Seminary, he placed some little pieces of  horsehair across the volumes which he supposed might interest Mademoiselle de  La Mole.They  vanished for weeks at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而于连确信，她的房间里总是放有伏尔泰的一、两卷最具哲学性的著作。他自己也常偷几本回去，这个版本很漂亮，装订得极豪华。他把旁边的几本挪一挪，拿走一本也就看不出来了，但是他很快发现，另有一人也在读伏尔泰。他使用神学院的一种诡计，把几小段马鬃放在他认为可能引起德·拉莫尔小姐兴趣的那几卷书上。这几卷书旋即失踪了好几个礼拜。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de La Mole, losing patience with his bookseller, who kept sending him all the  sham Memoirs, gave Julien orders to buy every new book that was at all  sensational. But, so that the poison might not spread through the household,  the secretary was instructed to place these books in a little bookcase that  stood in the Marquis's own room. He soon acquired the certainty that if any of  these books were hostile to the interests of Throne and Altar, they were not  long in vanishing. It was certainly not Norbert that was reading them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔先生对他的书商很恼火，所有的假回忆录都给他送了来，就命令于连把所有略具刺激性的新书都买回来。但是，为了不让毒素在家里传播，秘书遵命把这些书放进一个小书橱，就摆在侯爵的卧室里。他很快就确信，只要这些新书与王座或祭坛的利益相敌对，很快便不翼而飞。肯定不是诺贝尔在读。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien,  exaggerating the importance of this discovery, credited Mademoiselle de La Mole  with a Machiavellian duplicity. This feigned criminality wa a charm in his  eyes, almost the only moral charm that she possessed. The tediousness of hypocrisy  and virtuous conversation drove him to this excess.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连过于相信他的试验了，以为德·拉莫尔小姐是个马基雅维里那样的两面派。这种硬栽在她头上的邪恶，在他后来，倒几乎成了她唯一的精神魅力。对虚伪和说教的厌倦使他走上了极端。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  excited his imagination rather than let himself be carried away by love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他激发自己的想象力，更甚于受到爱情的驱使。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was after he had lost himself in dreams of the elegance of Mademoiselle de La  Mole's figure, the excellent taste of her toilet, the whiteness of her hand,  the beauty of her arm, the disinvoltura of all her movements, that he found  himself in love. Then, to complete her charm, he imagined her to be a Catherine  de' Medici. Nothing was too profound or too criminal for the character that he  assigned to her. It was the ideal of the Maslons, the Frilairs and Castanedes  whom he had admired in his younger days. It was, in short, the ideal, to him,  of Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>正是对德·拉莫尔小姐身材的优雅、衣着的精致趣味、手的白皙、胳膊的美和举手投足的从容神魂颠倒了一番之后，他发现自己爱上了她。为使其魅力臻于极致，他把她想象成卡特琳·德·美第奇。对于他所设想的她的性格来说，深则不厌其深，恶则不厌其恶。这是他年轻时钦佩的马斯隆们、福利莱们、卡斯塔奈德们的典型，一句话，他认为这就是巴黎人的典型。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Was  ever anything so absurd as to imagine profundity or criminality in the Parisian  character?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>还有什么比相信巴黎人城府深广和性情邪恶更可笑的吗？</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'It  is possible that this trio may be making a fool of me,' he thought.The  reader has learned very little of Julien's nature if he has not already seen  the sombre, frigid expression that he assumed when his eyes met those of Mathilde.  A bitter irony repulsed the assurances of friendship with which Mademoiselle de  La Mole in astonishment ventured on two or three occasions, to try him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“很可能这个三人帮在嘲弄我，”于连想。如果没有看见他的目光回答玛蒂尔德的目光时所流露出的阴郁冷漠的表情，那对他的性格就会了解得很肤浅。德·拉莫尔小姐感到惊讶，有两、三次大着胆于让他相信她的友谊，却都被一种辛辣的讽刺顶了回去。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Piqued  by his sudden eccentricity, the heart of this girl, naturally cold, bored,  responsive to intelligence, became as passionate as it was in her nature to be.  But there was also a great deal of pride in Mathilde's nature, and the birth of  a sentiment which made all her happiness dependent upon another was attended by  a sombre melancholy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个女孩子的心素来冷漠，厌倦，对精神的东西很敏感，受到这种突如其来的古怪态度的刺激，一变而为热情洋溢，流露出自然的本性。然而玛蒂尔德的性格中也有许多的骄傲，一种感情的萌生使她全部的幸福依赖于另一个人，这就同时带来了一种阴沉的忧郁。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  had made sufficient progress since his arrival in Paris to discern that this  was not the barren melancholy of boredom. Instead of being eager, as in the  past, for parties, shows and distractions of every kind, she avoided them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连自到了巴黎之后，已经有了相当的阅历，能够看出那不是厌倦所产生的干枯的忧郁。她不像从前那样贪恋晚会、看戏和种种消遣，反倒逃而避之。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Music  performed by French singers bored Mathilde to death, and yet Julien, who made  it his duty to be present at the close of the Opera, observed that she made her  friends take her there as often as possible. He thought he could detect that  she had lost a little of the perfect balance which shone in all her actions.  She would sometimes reply to her friends with witticisms that were offensive in  their pointed emphasis. It seemed to him that she had taken a dislike to the  Marquis de Croisenois. 'That young man must have a furious passion for money,  not to go off and leave a girl like that, however rich she may be!' thought  Julien. As for himself, indignant at the insults offered to masculine dignity,  his coldness towards her increased. Often he went the length of replying with  positive discourtesy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>法国人唱的歌让玛蒂尔德厌烦得要死，然而把歌剧院散场时露面当作职责的于连注意到，只要她能，她就让人带她上歌剧院。他自认为看出她已经失去了一些原本闪耀在她各种活动中的那种完美的分寸感。有几次回答她的朋友时，她的玩笑尖酸刻薄，几至伤人。他觉得她拿德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵当了出气筒。“这年轻人一定是爱钱爱得发了疯，不然早把她甩了，不管她多么有钱！”于连想。而他呢，他对她污辱男性的尊严感到愤怒，愈发对她冷淡了。他常常甚至很不礼貌地回答她。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>However  determined he might be not to be taken in by the signs of interest shown by  Mathilde, they were so evident on certain days, and Julien, from whose eyes the  scales were beginning to fall, found her so attractive, that he was at times  embarrassed by them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连决心不为玛蒂尔德感兴趣的表示所骗，然而有些日子里这种表示毕竟是很明显的，他的眼睛已经开始睁开了，发现她是那样地漂亮，有时不免心慌意乱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  skill and forbearance of these young men of fashion will end by triumphing over  my want of experience,' he told himself; 'I must go away, and put an end to all  this.' The Marquis had recently entrusted to him the management of a number of  small properties and houses which he owned in lower Languedoc. A visit to the  place became necessary: M. de La Mole gave a reluctant consent. Except in  matters of high ambition, Julien had become his second self.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“上流社会这些年轻人的机敏和耐心最终会战胜我的缺乏经验，”他对自己说，“我得走，让这一切有个了结。”侯爵在下朗格多克有不少小块地产和房产，刚刚交给他管理。去一趟是有必要的，德·拉莫尔先生勉强同意了。除了与他那勃勃野心有关的事务外，于连已经成了另一个他了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'When  all is said and done, they have not managed to catch me,' Julien told himself  as he prepared for his departure. 'Whether the jokes which Mademoiselle de La  Mole makes at the expense of these gentlemen be real, or only intended to  inspire me with confidence, I have been amused by them.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说到底，他们没有让我上钩，”于连想，一边做着出门的准备。“德·拉莫尔小姐对这些先生开的玩笑，无论是真实的，还是仅仅为了取得我的信任，反正我是开心解闷了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  there is no conspiracy against the carpenter's son, Mademoiselle de La Mole is  inexplicable, but she is just as much so to the Marquis de Croisenois as to me.  Yesterday, for instance, her ill humour was quite genuine, and I had the  pleasure of seeing discomfited in my favour a young man as noble and rich as I  am penniless and plebeian. That is my finest triumph. It will keep me in good  spirits in my post-chaise, as I scour the plains of Languedoc.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果没有针对木匠儿子的阴谋，德·拉莫尔小姐就无法理解了，不过，在我她是无法理解的，至少在德·克龄瓦泽努瓦侯爵她也是同样地无法理解。例如昨天，她真的生了气，我很高兴她为了对我好而强迫一个年轻人做他不服做的事，他是既高贵又富有，而我是既贫穷又卑贱，恰应对比。这是我打的最漂亮的—次胜仗；它可以让我快快活活地坐在驿车里的椅子上，在朗格多克平原上奔驰。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  had kept his departure secret, but Mathilde knew better than he that he was  leaving Paris next day, and for a long time. She pleaded a splitting headache,  which was made worse by the close atmosphere of the drawing-room. She walked  for hours in the garden, and so pursued with her mordant pleasantries Norbert,  the Marquis de Croisenois, Caylus, de Luz and various other young men who had  dined at the Hotel de La Mole, that she forced them to take their leave. She  looked at Julien in a strange fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连对他的动身保密，但是玛蒂尔德比他知道得还清楚，他第二天将离开巴黎，而且时间很长。她推说头疼得厉害，客厅里空气太闷，更加剧了她的头疼。她在花园里散步很久，用尖酸刻薄的玩笑对诺贝尔、德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵、凯吕斯、德·吕兹和其他几个在德，拉莫尔府吃晚饭的年轻人穷追不舍，逼得他们离开。她用一种古怪的目光望着于连。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  look is perhaps a piece of playacting,' thought he; 'but her quick breathing,  all that emotion! Bah!' he said to himself, 'who am I to judge of these  matters? This is an example of the most consummate, the most artificial  behaviour to be found among the women of Paris. That quick breathing, which so  nearly proved too much for me, she will have learned from Leontine Fay, whom  she admires so.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这目光也许是在演戏，”于连想，“可这急促的呼吸呢，还有这心慌意乱的种种表现呢！算了吧：“他对自己说，“我是什么人，居然想判断这些事？那是巴黎女人的最高明最狡猾的把戏呀。这种急促的呼吸几乎要碰到我了，她大概是从她那么喜爱的莱昂蒂娜·费伊那儿学来的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>They  were now left alone; the conversation was plainly languishing.'No!  Julien has no feeling for me,' Mathilde told herself with genuine distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>花园里就剩他们俩了，谈话显然已无法进行。“不！于连对我毫无感觉，”她对自己说，真的感到了不幸。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  he took leave of her, she clutched his arm violently:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他向她告辞，她使劲儿抓住他的胳膊：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  will receive a letter from me this evening,' she told him in a voice so  strained as to be barely audible.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您今晚会收到我的一封信，”她说话的声音都走了样，认不出来了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  had an immediate effect on Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>此情此景立刻感动了于连。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  father,' she went on, 'has a most natural regard for the services that you  render him. You must not go tomorrow; find some excuse.' And she ran from the  garden.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的父亲，”她继续说，“对您的效劳有公正的评价。明天必须不走，找一个借口。”她说完就跑了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Her  figure was charming. It would have been impossible to have a prettier foot, she  ran with a grace that enchanted Julien; but guess what was his second thought  when she had quite vanished. He was offended by the tone of command in which  she had uttered the words, you must.Similarly  Louis XV, as he breathed his last, was keenly annoyed by the words you must  awkwardly employed by his Chief Physician, and yet Louis XV was no upstart.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她的身材真迷人。她的脚也最漂亮，跑起来姿态优雅，把于连都看傻了；然而，谁能猜得到，她的身影完全消失之后，于连又想了些什么？她说必须这两个字时的那种命令的口气冒犯了他。路易十五临终时，也曾对他的首席医生笨拙地使用必须这两个字深感不快，不过路易十五可不是暴发户。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>An  hour later, a footman handed Julien a letter; it was nothing less than a  declaration of love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个钟头以后，仆人把一封信交给于连；这封信干脆就是爱情的表白。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  style is not unduly affected,' he said to himself, seeking by literary  observations to contain the joy that was contorting his features and forcing  him to laugh in spite of himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“文笔还不太做作，”于连心想，他想用文字的评论控制喜悦，然而他的脸已经抽紧，禁不住笑了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  so I,' he suddenly exclaimed, his excitement being too strong to be held in  check, 'I, a poor peasant, have received a declaration of love from a great  lady!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“终于，”他突然大声叫起来，激情太强烈，已经无法控制，“我，可怜的乡下人，我终于得到了一位贵妇人的爱情表白！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'As  for myself, I have not done badly,' he went on, controlling his joy as far as  was possible. 'I have succeeded in preserving the dignity of my character. I have  never said that I was in love.' He began to study the shapes of her letters;  Mademoiselle de La Mole wrote in a charming little English hand. He required  some physical occupation to take his mind from a joy which was bordering on  delirium.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“至于我，干得还不坏，”他想，尽可能压住心头的喜悦。“我知道如何保持我的性格的尊严。我从未说过我爱她。”他开始研究字体，德·拉莫尔小姐写得一手漂亮的英国式小字。他需要做点体力上的事，好从那快要使他发狂的喜悦中解脱出来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Your  departure obliges me to speak… It would be beyond my endurance not to see you  any more.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您要走了，我不能不说了……见不到您，我实在受不了……”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  sudden thought occurred to strike Julien as a discovery, interrupt the  examination that he was making of Mathilde's letter, and intensify his joy. 'I  am preferred to the Marquis de Croisenois,' he cried, 'I, who never say  anything that is not serious! And he is so handsome! He wears moustaches, a  charming uniform; he always manages to say, just at the right moment, something  witty and clever.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>一个想法突然袭上他的心头，仿佛一大发现，打断了他对玛蒂尔德的信的研究，使他感到加倍的快乐。“我战胜了德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵，”他喊道，“我，一个只说些正经事的人！而他是那么漂亮！他留着小胡子，有迷人的军装；他总是能在合适的时候找到又聪明又巧妙的话来说。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was an exquisite moment for Julien; he roamed about the garden, mad with  happiness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连有了美妙的一刻，他在花园里信步来去，幸福得发狂。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Later,  he went upstairs to his office, and sent in his name to the Marquis de La Mole,  who fortunately had not gone out. He had no difficulty in proving to him, by  showing him various marked papers that had arrived from Normandy, that the  requirements of his employer's lawsuits there obliged him to postpone his  departure for Languedoc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>稍后，他上楼来到自己的办公室，让人去通报德·拉莫尔侯爵，幸好他没有出门。他让侯爵看几份标明来自诺曼底的文件，很容易地证明了诺曼底的诉讼要处理，他不得不推迟到朗格多克的行期。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am very glad you are not going,' the Marquis said to him, when they had  finished their business, 'I like to see you.' Julien left the room; this speech  disturbed him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您不走我很高兴，”侯爵谈完事务以后对他说，“我喜欢见到您。”于连退下，这句话使他感到别扭。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  I am going to seduce his daughter! To render impossible, perhaps, that marriage  with the Marquis de Croisenois, which is the bright spot in his future: if he  is not made Duke, at least his daughter will be entitled to a tabouret.' Julien  thought of starting for Languedoc in spite of Mathilde's letter, in spite of  the explanation he had given the Marquis.This  virtuous impulse soon faded.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“而我呢，我却要去引诱他的女儿！而且可能还要便和德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵的婚事告吹，这可是他的未来最迷人的一件事啊，如果他当不了公爵，至少他的女儿会有一个凳子。于连打算不顾玛蒂尔德的信，也不顾已向侯爵做过的解释，动身去朗格多克。不过，这道德的光辉一闪即逝。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  generous I am,' he said to himself; 'I, a plebeian, to feel pity for a family  of such high rank! I, whom the Duc de Chaulnes calls a domestic!How  does the Marquis increase his vast fortune? By selling national securities,  when he hears at the Chateau that there is to be the threat of a Coup d' Etat  next day. And I, cast down to the humblest rank by a step motherly Providence,  I, whom Providence has endowed with a noble heart and not a thousand francs of  income, that is to say not enough for my daily bread, literally speaking, not  enough for my daily bread; am I to refuse a pleasure that is offered me? A  limpid spring which wells up to quench my thirst in the burning desert of  mediocrity over which I trace my painful course! Faith, I am no such fool;  everyone for himself in this desert of selfishness which is called life.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我真善良，”他对自己说，“我，一介平民，居然可怜起一个这种地位的人家了！我，一个被肖纳公爵称为仆人的人！侯爵是如何增加他那巨大的家产的？他在宫里得知第二天可能会发生政变，立刻就把公债卖掉。可我呢，后娘般的苍天把我抛到社会的最底层，给了我一颗高贵的心，却没给我一千法郎的年金，也就是说没给我面包，不折不扣地没给我面包；而我却拒绝送上门来的快乐！我如此艰难地穿越这片充斥着平庸的灼热沙漠，却要拒绝能够解除我的干渴的一泓清泉！真的，别这么傻了；在人们称为生活的这片自私自利的沙漠里，人人为自己。”</p>

<p>And  he reminded himself of several disdainful glances aimed at him by Madame de La  Mole, and especially by the ladies, her friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他想起了德·拉莫尔夫人，特别是她的朋友，那些贵妇们向他投来的满含着轻蔑的目光。</p>

<p>The  pleasure of triumphing over the Marquis de Croisenois completed the rout of  this lingering trace of virtue.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>战胜德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵的喜悦终于使这种道德的回忆败下阵来。</p>

<p>'How  I should love to make him angry!' said Julien; 'with what assurance would I now  thrust at him with my sword.' And he struck a sweeping blow at the air. 'Until  now, I was a smug, basely profiting by a trace of courage. After this letter, I  am his equal.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我多么希望看见他发火！”于连说，“我现在多么有把握给他一剑啊。”他摆了个姿式，作二次进攻状。“在此之前，我是个村学究，不光彩地自恃还有点儿勇气。这封信之后，我和他平等了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,'  he said to himself with an infinite delight, dwelling on the words, 'our  merits, the Marquis's and mine, have been weighed, and the poor carpenter from  the Jura wins the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“是的，”他怀着无限的欣喜悦悠悠地对自己说，“侯爵和我，我们俩的价值已经衡量过了，汝拉山区的可怜木匠占了上风。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Good!'  he cried, 'here is the signature to my reply ready found. Do not go and  imagine, Mademoiselle de La Mole, that I am forgetting my station. I shall make  you realise and feel that it is for the son of a carpenter that you are  betraying a descendant of the famous Guy de Croisenois, who followed Saint  Louis on his Crusade.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“好，”他叫道，“我在回信上就这样落款，您别以为，德·拉莫尔小姐，我忘了自己的身份。我要让您明白并且清楚地感觉到，您是为了一个木匠的儿子而背弃了曾经跟随圣跳易出参加十字军东征的大名晶晶的居伊·德·克鲁瓦绎努瓦的一个后裔。”</p>

<p>Julien  was unable to contain his joy. He was obliged to go down to the garden. His  room, in which he had locked himself up, seemed too confined a space for him to  breathe in.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连喜不自胜。他不得不下楼到花园里去。他把自己锁在里面的那间屋子，他觉得太狭小，喘不过气来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I,  a poor peasant from the Jura,' he kept on repeating, 'I, I condemned always to  wear this dismal black coat! Alas, twenty years ago, I should have worn uniform  like them! In those days a man of my sort was either killed, or a General at  six and thirty.' The letter, which he kept tightly clasped in his hand, gave him  the bearing and pose of a hero.'Nowadays,  it is true, with the said black coat, at the age of forty, a man has emoluments  of one hundred thousand francs and the Blue Riband, like the Bishop of  Beauvais.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我，汝拉山区的穷乡下人，”他不断他重复着，“我，注定一辈子穿这身惨兮兮的黑衣服！唉，早二十年，我会像他们一样穿军装，那时候一个像我这样的人，要么阵亡，要么三十六岁当上将军。”他紧紧握在手里的那封信，给了他一个英雄的个头儿和姿态。“现在，确实如此，穿上这身冕衣服，到了四十岁，也可以像博韦的主教先生那样有一万法郎的薪水和蓝绶带。”</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  well!' he said to himself, laughing like Mephistopheles, 'I have more sense  than they; I know how to choose the uniform of my generation.' And he felt an  intensification of his ambition and of his attachment to the clerical habit.  'How many Cardinals have there been of humbler birth than mine, who have risen  to positions of government! My fellow countryman Granvelle, for instance.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“好吧！”他像摩非斯特那样笑着对自己说，“我比他们有更多的聪明才智，我知道怎么选择我这个时代的制服。”他觉得他的野心和对法衣的眷恋膨胀起来。“有多少红衣主教出身比我还低，而他们掌过大权！例如我的同乡朗倍维尔。”</p>

<p>Gradually  Julien's agitation subsided; prudence rose to the surface. He said to himself,  like his master Tartuffe, whose part he knew by heart:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连的激动渐渐平静，谨慎又冒了出来。他暗自诵读达尔杜弗的台词，他对这位老师的角色可是牢记在心：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  might suppose these words an honest artifice… Nay, I shall not believe so  flattering a speech Unless some favour shown by her for whom I sigh Assure me  that they mean all that they might imply.' (Tartuffe, Act IV, Scene V)</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Tartuffe  also was ruined by a woman, and he was as good a man as most … My answer may be  shewn… a mishap for which we find this remedy,' he went on, pronouncing each  word slowly, and in accents of restrained ferocity, 'we begin it by quoting the  strongest expressions from the letter of the sublime Mathilde.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“达尔杜弗也是毁于一个女人，他并不比别人坏……我的回信也可能被出示……我们找到了下面这种办法来对付，”他用强压住的残忍口气慢慢地补充说，“我们要在回信的开头引述崇高的玛蒂尔德的来信中最热情的句子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yes,  but then four of M. de Croisenois's flunkeys will spring upon me, and tear the  original from me.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“就这么办，不过德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生的四个仆人会朝我扑过来，把原信夺走。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No,  for I am well armed, and am accustomed, as they know, to firing on flunkeys. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不会，因为我武装得很好，谁都知道我有朝仆人开枪的习惯。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very  well! Say, one of them has some courage; he springs upon me.He  has been promised a hundred napoleons. I kill or injure him, all the better,  that is what they want. I am flung into prison with all the forms of law; I  appear in the police court, and they send me, with all justice and equity on  the judges' part, to keep MM. Fontan and Magalon company at Poissy. There, I  lie upon straw with four hundred poor wretches, pellmell … And I am to feel  some pity for these people,' he cried, springing impetuously to his feet. 'What  pity do they show for the Third Estate when they have us in their power?' These  words were the dying breath of his gratitude to M. de La Mole which, in spite  of himself, had tormented him until then.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“就让他们来吧！其中有一个胆子大，朝我扑过来。有人答应赏他一百拿破仑。我把他杀死或者打伤，好极了，他们正求之不得。我被完全合法地投入监狱；我在轻罪法庭受审，经法官们公平合理地判决，把我送往普瓦西监狱和丰唐先生、马加隆先生作伴。我在那儿跟四百个乞丐胡乱睡在一起……而我居然会怜悯这些人，”他猛地站起来，高声嚷道，“他们怜悯落在他们手里的第三等级的人吗？”这句话埋葬了他对德·拉莫尔先生的感激之情，在此之前，他一直不由自主地受其折磨。</p>

<p>'Not  so fast, my fine gentlemen, I understand this little stroke of  Machiavellianism; the abbe Maslon or M. Castanede of the Seminary could not  have been more clever. You rob me of my incitement, the letter, and I become  the second volume of Colonel Caron at Colmar.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“且慢，贵族先生们，我知道这种马基雅维里式的小伎俩；马斯隆神甫或者神学院的卡斯塔奈德神甫不会干得更漂亮。你们把这封挑衅的信抢走，我就会变成科尔马的卡隆上校第二了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  moment, gentlemen, I am going to send the fatal letter in a carefully sealed  packet to the custody of M. l'abbe Pirard. He is an honest man, a Jansenist,  and as such out of reach of the temptations of the Budget. Yes, but he opens  letters… it is to Fouque that I must send this one.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“等一等，先生们，我要把这封要命的信装在小包里封好，托彼拉神甫保管。他是个正直的人，詹森派，因此他是不受金钱的诱惑的。是的，不过他总是拆别人的信……这一封我要送到富凯那儿去。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  must be admitted the glare in Julien's eyes was ghastly, his expression  hideous; it was eloquent of unmitigated crime. He was an unhappy man at war  with the whole of society.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>应该承认，于连的目光是残暴的，脸上的表情是丑恶的，显示出纯粹的罪恶。这是一个正在和整个社会作战的不幸的人。</p>

<div class="left">

<p>'To  arms!' cried Julien. And he sprang with one bound down the steps that led from  the house. He entered the letter-writer's booth at the street corner; the man  was alarmed. 'Copy this,' said Julien, giving him Mademoiselle de La Mole's  letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“拿起武器：“于连喊道。他一步跳下府邱的台阶。他走进街角一个代书人的铺子，那人害怕了。“抄下来，”他把德·拉莫尔小姐的信递绘他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>While  the writer was thus engaged, he himself wrote to Fouque; he begged him to keep  for him a precious article. 'But,' he said to himself, laying down his pen,  'the secret room in the post office will open my letter, and give you back the  one you seek; no, gentlemen.' He went and bought an enormous Bible from a  Protestant bookseller, skilfully concealed Mathilde's letter in the boards, had  it packed up with his own letter, and his parcel went off by the mail,  addressed to one of Fouque's workmen, whose name was unknown to anybody in  Paris.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>代书人抄，他自己则给富凯写信：他求他保存一样珍贵的东西。“但是，”他停下笔，对自己说，“邮局的书信检查处会拆开我的信，把你们要找的那封信给你们……不，先生们。”他到一家新教徒开的书店里买了一本很大的《圣经》，非常巧妙地把玛蒂尔德的信藏在封面里，然后打包，由邮车送走，收件人是富凯的一个工人，巴黎没有人知道他的名字。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  done, he returned joyful and brisk to the Hotel de La Mole. 'It is our turn,  now,' he exclaimed, as he locked himself into his room, and flung off his coat:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这件事办完之后，他轻松愉快地回到德·拉莫尔府。“该我们了！现在，”他大声嚷道，把自己锁在房里，脱掉了外衣。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What,  Mademoiselle,' he wrote to Mathilde, 'it is Mademoiselle de La Mole who, by the  hand of Arsene, her father's servant, transmits a letter couched in too  seductive terms to a poor carpenter from the Jura, doubtless to play a trick  upon his simplicity … ' And he transcribed the most unequivocal sentences from  the letter he had received.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！小姐，”他给玛蒂尔德写信，“是德·拉莫尔小姐经她父亲的仆人阿尔塞纳之手，把一封太有诱惑力的信交给汝拉山区的一个可怜的木匠，无疑是为了玩弄他的单纯……”然后，他转抄刚才收到的那封信中含义最明显的句子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  own would have done credit to the diplomatic prudence of M. le Chevalier de  Beauvoisis. It was still only ten o'clock; Julien, intoxicated with happiness  and with the sense of his own power, so novel to a poor devil like himself,  went off to the Italian opera. He heard his friend Geronimo sing. Never had  music raised him to so high a pitch. He was a god.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他这封信真可以为德·博瓦西骑士先生的外交谨慎增光了。此刻刚刚十点钟；于连陶醉在幸福和对自己的力量的感觉之中，这预感觉对一个穷光蛋来说是那样地新奇，他走进意大利歌剧院。他听他的朋友热罗尼莫唱歌。音乐从未让他兴奋到这种程度。他成了一个神。</p>
