<p>But  if I take this pleasure with so much prudence and circumspection, it ceases to  be a pleasure for me.</p>
<p>LOPE DE VEGA</p></div>

<p>但是，如果我这样谨慎小心地享受这种快乐，那它对我来说就不成其为一种快乐了。</p>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>Immediately  on his return to Paris, and on leaving the study of the Marquis de La Mole, who  appeared greatly disconcerted by the messages that were conveyed to him, our  hero hastened to find Conte Altamira. With the distinction of being under  sentence of death, this handsome foreigner combined abundant gravity and had  the good for tune to be devout; these two merits and, more than all, the  exalted birth of the Count were entirely to the taste of Madame de Fervaques,  who saw much of him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>刚刚回到巴黎，我们的英雄就去见德·拉莫尔侯爵，侯爵对他带回的答复显得大惑不解。于连走出他的办公室，立刻跑去见阿尔塔米拉伯爵。这位漂亮的外国人，占了被判死刑的好处，又兼有颇为庄重的仪态和信教度诚的福气，加上伯爵这样高贵的出身，十分地中德·费瓦克夫人的意，因此她常常见他。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  confessed to him gravely that he was deeply in love with her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连郑重其事地向他承认，他很爱她。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'She  represents the purest and loftiest virtue,' replied Altamira, 'only it is a  trifle Jesuitical and emphatic. There are days on which I understand every word  that she uses, but I do not understand the sentence as a whole. She often makes  me think that I do not know French as well as people say. This acquaintance  will make you talked about; it will give you a position in society. But let us  go and see Bustos,' said Conte Altamira, who had an orderly mind; 'he has made  love to Madame la Marechale.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她是个最纯洁、最高尚的有道德的女人。”阿尔塔米拉回答道，—只是有点儿伪善和夸张。有时候，她用的词我都懂，可是连成句子我就不懂了。她常常让我觉得我的法国话不像别人认为的那么好。认识她，可以使您出名，加重您在社交界的份量。不过，我们去找比斯托斯吧，”阿尔塔米拉伯爵说，他可是个头脑有条理的人，“他曾经追求过元帅夫人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Don  Diego Bustos made them explain the matter to him in detail,without saying a  word, like a barrister in chambers. He had a plump, monkish face, with black  moustaches, and an unparalleled gravity; in other respects, a good carbonaro.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>唐·迭戈·比斯托斯让他们把事情的原委详加解释，自己一言不发，俨然一位坐在事务所里的律师。他有着一张修道士的大脸，留着小黑胡子，无比地庄重；此外，他还是一个很好的烧炭党人。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  understand,' he said at length to Julien. 'Has the Marechale de Fervaques had  lovers, or has she not? Have you, therefore, any hope of success? That is the  question. It is as much as to say that, for my own part, I have failed. Now  that I am no longer aggrieved, I put it to myself in this way: often she is out  of temper, and, as I shall shortly prove to you, she is nothing if not  vindictive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我明白了，”最后他对于连说，“德·费瓦克夫人有过情夫吗？还是不曾有过？因而您有成功的希望吗？问题就在这里。我应该对您说，我嘛，我失败了。现在我不再感到恼火，我这样说服自己：她常常发脾气，我很快就跟您讲，她还挺爱报复。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  do not find in her that choleric temperament which is a mark of genius and  covers every action with a sort of glaze of passion. It is, on the contrary, to  her calm and phlegmatic Dutch manner that she owes her rare beauty and the  freshness of her complexion.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我不认为她是胆汁质的气质，此种气质是天才的气质，是涂在一切行动上的一层激情的光泽。相反，她那稀世的美和鲜丽的颜色来自荷兰人的粘液质的、沉静的气质。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was growing impatient with the deliberateness and imperturbable phlegm of the  Spaniard; now and again, in spite of himself, he gave vent to a monosyllabic  comment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>西班牙人的慢性子和不可动摇的冷漠，让于连急得慌，时不时从嘴里不由自主地蹦出几个单音节的词来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Will  you listen to me?' Don Diego Bustos inquired gravely.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您愿意听我说吗？”唐·迭戈·比斯托斯严肃地对他说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Pardon  the furia francese; I am all ears,' said Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“请原谅法国人的急性子，我洗耳恭听，”于连说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Well,  then, the Marechale de Fervaques is much given to hatred; she is pitiless in  her pursuit of people she has never seen, lawyers, poor devils of literary men  who have written songs like Colle, you know?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“德·费瓦克元帅夫人因此非常喜欢憎恨，她毫不留情地控告一些她从未见过的人，律师啦，写像科莱那样的歌词的穷文人啦，您知道吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>&quot;J'ai  la marotte D'aimer Marote,&quot; etc.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“‘喜欢玛罗特是我的癖好……’”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>And  Julien was obliged to listen to the quotation to the end. The Spaniard greatly  enjoyed singing in French.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连得把整首歌听完。西班牙人用法文唱得津津有味。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  divine song was never listened to with greater impatience. When he had  finished: 'The Marechale,' said Don Diego Bustos, 'has ruined the author of the  song:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这首绝妙的歌还从未被这么不耐烦地听过。唐·迭戈·比斯托斯唱完了歌，说：“元帅夫人让人把这首歌的作者解雇了：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>&quot;Un  jour l'amant au cabaret … &quot;'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一天情人在酒馆……”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was in an agony lest he should wish to sing it. He contented himself with  analysing it. It was, as a matter of fact, impious and hardly decent.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连真害怕他又要唱下去。还好，他只是分析了歌词。这首歌确实亵渎宗教，有伤风化。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'When  the Marechale flew into a passion with that song,' said Don Diego, 'I pointed  out to her that a woman of her rank ought not to read all the stupid things  that are published. Whatever progress piety and gravity may make, there will  always be in France a literature of the tavern. When Madame de Fervaques had  the author, a poor devil on half pay, deprived of a post worth eighteen hundred  francs: &quot;Take care,&quot; said I to her, &quot;you have attacked this  rhymester with your weapons, he may reply to you with his rhymes: he will make  a song about virtue. The gilded saloons will be on your side; the people who  like to laugh will repeat his epigrams.&quot; Do you know, Sir, what answer the  Marechale made me? &quot;In  the Lord's service all Paris would see me tread the path of martyrdom; it would  be a novel spectacle in France. The people would learn to respect the quality.  It would be the happiest day of my life.&quot; Never were her eyes more  brilliant.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“元帅夫人对这首歌发怒的时候，”唐·迭戈说，“我提醒她，她这种地位的女人根本就不应该读眼下出版的那些无聊玩艺儿。不管宗教的虔诚和风气的严肃如何发展，在法国总会有一种酒馆文学。当德·费瓦克夫人让人把作者，一个领半饷的穷鬼的一千八百法郎的职位撤掉的时候，我对她说：‘您用您的武器攻击了这个拙劣的诗人，他会用他的诗回击您：他会写一首关于道德高尚的女人的歌的。金碧辉煌的客厅会支持您，可是喜欢笑的人却会把他那些俏皮话到处传唱。’您知道元帅夫人怎么回答我吗，先生？‘整个巴黎将会看见我为了天主的利益而不惜殉道，这将是法国的一大奇观。民众将学会尊重品德。那将是我一生最美好的日于。’此刻，她的眼睛比什么时候都美。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  she has superb eyes,' exclaimed Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“她的眼睛真是美极了，”于连叫道。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  see that you are in love… Very well, then,' Don Diego Bustos went on gravely,  'she has not the choleric constitution that impels one to vengeance. If she  enjoys injuring people, nevertheless, it is because she is unhappy, I suspect  inward suffering. May she not be a prude who has grown weary of her calling?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我看得出您爱她……总之，”唐·迭戈·比斯托斯很庄重地说，“她并没有那种驱使人进行报复的多胆汁体质。如果说她喜欢伤害人，那是因为她感到不幸，我疑心那是一种内心的不幸，这是不是一个对以卫道为己任感到厌倦的正经女人呢？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Spaniard gazed at him in silence for fully a minute.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>西班牙人望着他整整一分钟，不说话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is the whole question,' he went on gravely, 'and it is from this that you may  derive some hope. I gave it much thought during the two years in which I  professed myself her most humble servant. Your whole future, you, Sir, who are  in love, hangs on this great problem. Is she a prude, weary of her calling, and  malicious because she is miserable?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“全部问题就在这里，”他郑重其事地说，“从这里您可以得到一点儿希望。在我充当她的谦卑的仆人的两年中，我对此想了很多。您的整个前途，恋爱中的先生，取决于这一重大问题：她是一个对以卫道为己任感到厌倦、并且因感到不幸而变得凶恶的正经女人吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Or  rather,' said Altamira, emerging at last from his profound silence,'can it be  what I have said to you twenty times? Simply and solely French vanity; it is  the memory of her father, the famous cloth merchant, that causes the  unhappiness of a character naturally morose and dry.There  could be only one happiness for her, that of living in Toledo, and being  tormented by a confessor, who every day would show her hell gaping for her.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“或者，”阿尔塔米拉说，终于打破了沉默，“就像我跟您说过二十遍那样，干脆就是出于法国人的虚荣心？是对她父亲，著名的呢绒商的回忆造成了这个生性阴郁冷酷的人的不幸。她只可能有一种幸福，就是住在托菜多，受一位仟悔师的折磨，他每天都让她看见洞开的地狱。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  Julien rose to leave: 'Altamira tells me that you are one of us,' Don Diego  said to him, graver than ever. 'One day you will help us to reconquer our  freedom, and so I wish to help you in this little diversion. It is as well that  you should be acquainted with the Marechale's style; here are four letters in  her hand.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连离开时，唐·迭戈·比斯托斯说，神色更加庄重：“阿尔塔米拉告诉我，您是自己人。有朝一日您会帮助我们重获自由的，因此我愿意在这小小的消遣中助您一臂之力。了解一下元帅夫人的风格对您有好处，这是她的四封亲笔信。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  shall have them copied,' cried Julien, 'and return them to you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我去抄下来，”于连叫道，“再还给您。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  no one shall ever learn from you a single word of what we have been saying?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“绝不会有人从您那里知道我们说的一个字吧？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Never,  upon my honour!' cried Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“绝不会，”于连高声道，“以名誉担保！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Then  may heaven help you!' the Spaniard concluded; and he accompanied Julien and  Altamira in silence to the head of the stair.This  scene cheered our hero somewhat; he almost smiled. 'And here is the devout  Altamira,' he said to himself, 'helping me in an adulterous enterprise.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那就愿天主助您！”西班牙人说，默默地把阿尔塔米拉和于连送到楼梯口。这一幕使我们的英雄略微有了点喜气，差不多要微笑了。“看这个虔诚的阿尔塔米拉，”他心里说，“竟帮助我与人通奸！”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Throughout  the whole of the grave conversation of Don Diego Bustos, Julien had been  attentive to the stroke of the hours on the clock of the Hotel d'Aligre.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在跟唐·迭戈·比斯托斯进行这场严肃的谈话的过程中，于连一直注意德·阿利格尔府中的大钟报时。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  dinner hour was approaching, he was to see Mathilde again! He went home, and  dressed himself with great care.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚饭的时间快到了，他又要看见玛蒂尔德了！他回去仔细穿好衣服。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  first blunder,' he said to himself, as he was going downstairs; 'I must carry  out the Prince's orders to the letter.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“开始就干蠢事，”他下楼时心想，“应该严格遵守亲王的医嘱。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  returned to his room, and put on a travelling costume of the utmost simplicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他又回到房里，换上一件简而又简的旅行装。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Now,'  he thought, 'I must consider how I am to look at her.' It was only half past  five, and dinner was at six. He decided to go down to the drawing-room, which  he found deserted. The sight of the blue sofa moved him to tears; soon his  cheeks began to burn. 'I must get rid of this absurd sensibility,' he said to  himself angrily; 'it will betray me.' He took up a newspaper to keep himself in  countenance, and strolled three or four times from the drawing-room to the  garden.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“现在，”他想，“要注意目光。”这时才到五点半，晚饭是六点钟，他想去客厅看看，没有人。看见蓝色长沙发，他心头一热，眼泪就上来了，随即脸颊也热得烫手，“必须打掉这种愚蠢的敏感，”他生气地对自己说，“它会出卖我的。”他拿起一份报纸，想静下心来，从客厅到花园走了三、四个来回。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was only in fear and trembling and safely concealed behind a big oak tree that  he ventured to raise his eyes to the window of Mademoiselle de La Mole's room.  It was fast shut; he nearly fell to the ground, and stood for a long time  leaning against the oak; then, with a tottering step,he went to look at the  gardener's ladder.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他浑身发抖，在一棵大橡树后藏好，才大着胆子看德·拉莫尔小姐的窗户。窗户关着，颇神秘，他几乎要晕倒，久久地靠在橡树上；然后，他踉踉跄跄地去看园丁的那架梯子。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  link of the chain, forced open by him in circumstances, alas, so different, had  not? been mended. Carried away by a mad  impulse, Julien pressed it to his lips.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>先前被他拧断的那个链环还没修好。唉，事过境迁了！一阵疯狂的冲动，于连不能自持，把它压在了嘴唇上。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  a long course of wandering between drawing-room and garden,he found himself  horribly tired; this was an initial success which pleased him greatly. 'My eyes  will be dull and will not betray me!' Gradually, the guests arrived in the drawing-room;  the door never opened without plunging Julien in mortal dread.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>从客厅到花园，于连来回走了很久，感到极为疲倦；这是他强烈地感到的第一个成功。“我的目光将是暗淡的，不会出卖我！”渐渐地，吃饭的人进了客厅，每—次开门都在于连的心里引起一阵要命的慌乱。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">


<p>They  sat down to table. At length Mademoiselle de La Mole appeared, still faithful  to her principle of keeping the others waiting. She blushed a deep red on  seeing Julien; she had not been told of his arrival. Following Prince  Korasoff's advice, Julien looked at her hands; they were trembling. Disquieted  himself, beyond all expression, by this discovery, he was thankful to appear to  be merely tired.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>大家入座。终于，德·拉莫尔小姐露面了，让人等的老习惯坚持不误。她看见了于连，脸腾地红了。人家没告诉她于连已经回来。根据科拉索夫亲王的嘱咐，他看她的手；那双手在抖。这个发现也使他慌乱得无法形容，他相当高兴，他只显得疲倦。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de La Mole sang his praises. The Marquise addressed him shortly afterwards, and  expressed concern at his appearance of fatigue. Julien kept on saying to  himself: 'I must not look at Mademoiselle de La Mole too much, but I ought not  either to avoid her eye. I must appear to be what I really was a week before my  disaster… ' He had occasion to be satisfied with his success, and remained in  the drawing-room. Attentive for the first time to the lady of the house, he  spared no effort to make the men of her circle talk, and to keep the conversation  alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔先生称赞他。过了一会儿，侯爵夫人也跟他说话，对他那疲倦的神色安慰了几句。于连时时刻刻对自己说：“我不应该多看德·拉莫尔小姐，但是我的目光也不应该躲着她。我在不幸发生前一个礼拜是什么样子，现在就应该是什么样子……”他有理由对成功感到满意，留在客厅不动。他头一次向女主人献殷勤，尽力让她那个圈子里的男人说话，并让谈话保持活跃。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  politeness was rewarded: about eight o'clock, Madame la Marechale de Fervaques  was announced. Julien left the room and presently reappeared, dressed with the  most scrupulous care. Madame de La Mole was vastly flattered by this mark of respect,  and sought to give him a proof of her satisfaction by speaking of his travels  to Madame de Fervaques. Julien took his seat beside the Marechale, in such a  way that his eyes should not be visible to Mathilde. Thus placed, and following  all the rules of the art, he made Madame de Fervaques the object of the most  awed admiration. It was with an outburst on this sentiment that the first of  the fifty-three letters of which Prince Korasoff had made him a present began.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的礼貌得到了酬报：将近八点钟，仆人通报德·费瓦克元帅夫人到。于连溜出去，很快重新露面。十分用心地打扮了一番。德·拉莫尔夫人很感激他这种尊敬的表示，她想证明她的感激之情，就向德·费瓦克夫人谈起他的旅行。于连在元帅夫人身旁坐下，正好让玛蒂尔德看不见他的眼睛。这样坐定，他完全按照那门艺术的规定，把德·费瓦克夫人当成了痴心爱恋的对象。科克索夫亲王送给他的那五十三封信中的第一封，开始就是关于这种感情的大段文字。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marechale announced that she was going on to the OperaBouffe.Julien  hastened there; he found the Chevalier de Beauvoisis, who took him to the box  of the Gentlemen of the Household, immediately beside that of Madame de  Fervaques. Julien gazed at her incessantly. 'I must,' he said to himself, as he  returned home, 'keep a diary of the siege; otherwise I should lose count of my  attacks.' He forced himself to write down two or three pages on this boring  subject, and thus succeeded (marvel of marvels!) in hardly giving a thought to  Mademoiselle de La Mole.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>元帅夫人说她要去喜歌剧院。于连也急忙赶去。在那儿看见了德·博瓦西骑士。骑士把他带进宫内侍从先生们的包厢，正好挨着德·费瓦克夫人的包厢。于连一个劲儿地看她。“我得记围攻日记，”他回府后对自己说，“否则我会忘记进攻的。”他强迫自己就这个乏味的主题写下两、三页，这样他才几乎不去想德·拉莫尔小姐了，岂不妙哉！</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  had almost forgotten him during his absence. 'After all, he is only a common  person,' she thought, 'his name will always remind me of the greatest mistake  of my life. I must return in all sincerity to the recognised standards of prudence  and honour; a woman has everything to lose in forgetting them.' She showed  herself ready to permit at length the conclusion of the arrangement with the  Marquis de Croisenois, begun so long since. He was wild with joy; he would have  been greatly astonished had anyone told him that it was resignation that lay at  the root of this attitude on Mathilde's part, which was making him so proud.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在他旅行其间，玛蒂尔德差不多已把他忘了。“说到底，不过是一个常人罢了，”她想，“他的名字将永远让我记住我一生中最大的错误。应该诚心诚意地回到一般人所谓的明智和名誉上去，一个女人要是忘了这些，就会失去一切。”她表示她和德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦侯爵之间准备已久的婚约终于可以定下来了。他高兴得发狂，如果有人跟他说，在玛蒂尔德的态度深处有一种屈从的味道，他一定感到非常惊讶，她是那样地让他感到自豪。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>All  Mademoiselle de La Mole's ideas changed at the sight of Julien. 'In reality,  that is my husband,' she said to herself; 'if I return in sincerity to the  standards of prudence, it is obviously he that I ought to marry.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐一看见于连，想法又都变了。“真的，这才是我的丈夫，”她对自己说，“如果我诚心诚意地回到明智的观念上去，我要嫁给的显然是他呀。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  was prepared for importunities, for an air of misery on Julien's part; she  prepared her answers: for doubtless, on rising from table, he would endeavour  to say a few words to her. Far from it, he remained fixed in the drawing-room,  his eyes never even turned towards the garden, heaven knows with how great an  effort! 'It would be better to get our explanation over at once,' Mademoiselle  de La Mole told herself; she went out by herself to the garden, Julien did not  appear there. Mathilde returned and strolled past the drawing-room windows; she  saw him busily engaged in describing to Madame de Fervaques the old ruined  castles that crown the steep banks of the Rhine and give them so distinctive a  character. He was beginning to acquit himself none too badly in the use of the  sentimental and picturesque language which is called wit in certain  drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>她预料于连会纠缠，会显出不幸的样子；她已准备好她的回答，因为吃罢晚饭，他肯定试图跟她说几句话。恰恰相反，他坚决待在客厅里，甚至不朝花园看一眼，天知道这有多难！“最好是立刻解释清楚，”德·拉莫尔小姐想；她独自去了花园，于连根本不露面。玛蒂尔德到客厅的落地长窗附近走来走去，见他正忙着向德·费瓦克夫人描绘莱茵河畔山丘上倾圮的古堡，这些古堡为山丘增色不少。对于一些客厅称为才智的那种感伤的、别致的句子，他已开始用得不错了。</p>

<p>Prince  Korasoff would indeed have been proud, had he been in Paris: the evening was  passing exactly as he had foretold.</p>

<p>An  intrigue among those constituting the Power behind the Throne was about to  dispose of several Blue Ribands; Madame la Marechale de Fervaques insisted that  her great uncle should be made a Knight of the Order. The Marquis de La Mole  was making a similar claim for his father-in-law; they combined their efforts,  and the Marechale came almost every day to the Hotel de La Mole. It was from  her that Julien learned that the Marquis was to become a Minister: he offered  the Camarilla a highly ingenious plan for destroying the Charter, without any  fuss, in three years' time.</p>

<p>秘密政府的成员们密谋颁发几条蓝绶带；德·费瓦克元帅夫人坚持她的叔祖要有一条。德·拉莫尔侯爵也为岳父提出同样的要求；他们于是共同努力，德·费瓦克夫人几乎每天都到德·拉莫尔府上来。从她那儿，于连知道侯爵快当部长了。他向王党提出了一个非常巧妙的计划，三年内取消宪章而又不至引起震动。</p>

<p>Julien  might expect a Bishopric, if M. de La Mole entered the Ministry; but to his  eyes all these important interests were as though hidden by a veil. His  imagination perceived them now only vaguely, and so to speak in the distance.  The fearful misery which was driving him mad made him see every interest in  life in the state of his relations with Mademoiselle de La Mole. He calculated  that after five or six years of patient effort, he might succeed in making her  love him once again.</p>

<p>如果德·拉莫尔先生当了部长，于连可望得到一个主教的职位；然而，在他眼里，这些重大的利益都仿佛蒙着一重薄纱，他只能在想象中模模糊糊地看到，而且可以说还离得很远。可怕的不幸把他弄得疯疯癫癫的，生活的全部利益都在他和德·拉莫尔小姐的关系之中。他估计经过五、六年的细心呵护，他会重新被她爱上。</p>

<p>This  coolest of heads had, as we see, sunk to a state of absolute unreason. Of all  the qualities that had distinguished him in the past, there remained to him  only a trace of firmness. Faithful to the letter to the plan of conduct  dictated to him by Prince Korasoff, every evening he took his place as near as  possible to the armchair occupied by Madame de Fervaques, but found it  impossible to think of a word to say to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>人们看到，这个那么冷静的头脑已经跌进完全丧失理智的状态。曾经使他卓尔不群的种种长处中，如今只剩下一点儿坚定了。他切切实实地执行科拉索夫亲王制定的行动计划，每晚坐在离德·费瓦克夫人的椅子相当近的地方，可是他找不出一句话跟她说。</p>

<p>The  effort that he was imposing on himself to appear cured in the eyes of Mathilde  absorbed all his spiritual strength, he remained rooted beside the Marechale  like a barely animate being; his eyes even, as in the extremity of physical  suffering, had lost all their fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他强迫自己，努力在玛蒂尔德眼中显出已经痊愈的样子，这使他的全部精力消耗殆尽。他待在元帅夫人身旁，没有一点几活气；甚至他的眼睛也失去了全部的光芒，仿佛处在极端的肉体痛苦之中。</p>

<p>Since  Madame de La Mole's attitude towards the world was never anything more than a  feeble copy of the opinions of that husband who might make her a Duchess, for  some days she had been lauding Julien's merits to the skies.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔夫人例来只是反证她那能让她成为公爵夫人的丈夫的看法，因此几天来，她把于连的好处捧上了天。 </p>
