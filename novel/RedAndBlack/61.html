<p>So  this is the fine miracle of your civilisation! You have turned love into an  ordinary matter.</p>

<p>喏，这就是你们的文明的伟大奇迹！你们把爱情变成了一件极其平常的事。</p>
<p>巴纳夫</p></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>Julien  hurried to Madame de La Mole's box. His eyes met first the tearful eyes of  Mathilde; she was weeping without restraint, there was no one present but  people of minor importance, the friend who had lent them the box and some men  of her acquaintance. Mathilde laid her hand upon Julien's; she seemed to have  forgotten all fear of her mother. Almost stifled by her sobs, she said nothing  to him but the single word:'Guarantees!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连匆匆进入德·拉莫尔夫人的包厢。他的眼睛首先遇见的是玛蒂尔德的泪水模糊的眼睛；她毫无节制地哭着，包厢里只有些地位低下的人，借给她们包厢的那个女友和她的几个熟识的男人。玛蒂尔德把手放在于连的手里，好像忘了对母亲的恐惧。她几乎被泪水哽噎住了，只对他说了这两个字：“保证！”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Whatever  I do, I must not speak to her,' thought Julien, greatly moved himself, and  covering his eyes as best he could with his hand, ostensibly to avoid the  lustre that was blazing into the boxes on the third tier. 'If I speak, she can  no longer doubt the intensity of my emotion, the sound of my voice will betray  me, all may be lost once more.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“至少，我不跟她说话，”他心想，他也非常激动，勉强用手挡住眼睛，说是吊灯晃得第三层包厢的人睁不开眼睛。“如果我说话，她就会知道我非常激动，因为我说话的声音会出卖我，我还可能失去一切。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  struggles were far more painful than in the morning, his spirit had had time to  grow disturbed. He was afraid of seeing Mathilde's vanity wounded. Frantic with  love and passion, he pledged himself not to speak to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的心己经激动了一整天，此刻，内心的斗争更加艰难。他害怕看见玛蒂尔德又上来那股虚荣劲儿。他陶醉于爱情和快乐，却极力克制，不跟她说话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  is, to my mind, one of the finest traits of his character; a person capable of  such an effort to control himself may go far, si fata sinant.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>依我看，这是他的性格的最出色的特点之一，一个人能作出这样的努力克制自己，是能有大出息的。如果命运允许的话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mademoiselle  de La Mole insisted upon taking Julien home. Fortunately it was raining in  torrents. But the Marquise made him sit facing herself, talked to him  continuously, and prevented his saying a word to her daughter. One would have  thought that the Marquise was concerned for Julien's happiness; no longer  afraid of destroying everything by the intensity of his emotion, he abandoned  himself to it with frenzy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·拉莫尔小姐坚持要带于连回府。幸亏雨下得很大。候爵夫人让他坐在自己对面，跟他说个不停。他根本不能跟她女儿说话。人们真可  以认为侯爵夫人在小心呵护于连的幸福；他不再害怕会因过度激动而毁掉一切，就索性疯狂地沉湎其中了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Dare  I say that on entering his own room Julien threw himself on his knees and  covered with kisses the love letters given him by Prince Korasoff?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我敢说吗？”于连回到房间，立刻跪倒在地，不住地亲吻科拉索夫亲王给他的情书。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  you great man! What do I not owe to you?' he cried in his frenzy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“伟大的人啊！我什么不是你给的呢？”他在疯狂中大叫。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Gradually  a little coolness returned to him. He compared himself to a general who had  just won the first half of a great battle. 'The advantage is certain, immense,'  he said to himself; 'but what is going to happen to morrow? An instant may ruin  everything.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>渐渐地，他冷静了些。他把自己比作一位将军，刚刚赢得了一场大战役的一半。“优势是肯定的，巨大的，”他暗自想道，“可明天会发  生什么事呢？一切仍可毁于一瞬。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  opened with a passionate impulse the Memoirs dictated at Saint Helena by  Napoleon, and for two solid hours forced himself to read them;his eyes alone  read the words, no matter, he forced himself to the task.During  this strange occupation, his head and heart, rising to the level of everything  that is most great, were at work without his knowledge. 'This is a very  different heart from Madame de Renal's,' he said to himself, but he went no  farther.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的手激动得发抖，打开了拿破仑在圣赫勒布岛口授的《回忆录》；长长的两个钟头，他强迫自己读；他只是眼睛在看，管它呢，他仍然强迫自己读下去，在这种奇特的阅读中，他的头脑和他的心灵进人至高至上的境界，不停地活动着，连他自己都不知道。“这颗心和德·莱纳夫人的心很不一样，”他对自己说，可是他不往下想了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Make  her afraid,' he cried of a sudden, flinging the book from him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“让她害怕，”他突然喊道，把书远远地一抛。“我只有让敌人害怕，敌人才会服从我。那时候敌人就不敢蔑视我了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  enemy will obey me only so long as I make him fear me, then he will not dare to  despise me.'He  paced up and down his little room, wild with joy. To be frank, this happiness  was due to pride rather than love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他在小房间里来回走着，沉醉在欢乐之中。实际上，这种幸福是骄傲多于爱情。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Make  her afraid!' he repeated proudly to himself, and he had reason to be proud.  'Even in her happiest moments, Madame de Renal always doubted whether my love  were equal to hers. Here, it is a demon that I am conquering, I must therefore  conquer.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“让她害怕！”他自豪地重复道，而他是有理由自豪的。“就是在她最幸福的时刻，德·莱纳夫人也总是怀疑我的爱情和她的爱情相等。  这里，我制服的是一个恶魔，因此必须制服。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  knew well that next morning, by eight o'clock, Mathilde would be in the  library; he did not appear there until nine, burning with love, but his head  controlled his heart. Not a single minute passed, perhaps, without his  repeating to himself: 'Always keep her mind occupied with the great  uncertainty: &quot;Does he love me?&quot; Her privileged position, the flattery  she receives from all who speak to her make her a little too much inclined to  self-assurance.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他知道，第二天早晨八点钟，玛蒂尔德就会到图书室；他九点钟才去，怀着炽热的爱情，可头脑还控制着心。他也许没有一分钟不对自己说：“要让她老是怀着这个巨大的疑团：‘他爱我吗？’她那辉煌的地位，包围着她的种种阿谀奉承，都使她有些过于自信。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  found her pale, calm, seated upon the divan, but incapable, apparently, of  making any movement. She offered him her hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他发现她苍白，平静，坐在沙发上，不过看上去似乎动都不能动了。她向他伸出手：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Dear,  I have offended you, it is true; you are perhaps vexed with me?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“朋友，我冒犯了您，是的；您大概生我的气了吧？……”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was not expecting so simple a tone. He was on the point of betraying himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>于连没有料到她的口气这样平常。他就要泄露内心的秘密了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  wish for guarantees, dear,' she went on after a silence which she had hoped to  see broken; 'that is only fair. Carry me off, let us start for London. I shall  be ruined for ever, disgraced… ' She found the courage to withdraw her hand  from Julien so as to hide her eyes with it. All the sentiments of modesty and  feminine virtue had returned to her heart…'Very  well! Disgrace me,' she said at length with a sigh, 'it is a guarantee.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您要保证，我的朋友，”一阵沉默之后，她又说，她真希望打破这沉默呀，“这是公正的。把我拐走吧，我们去伦敦……我将永远地毁  了，身败名裂……”她鼓起勇气把手从于连的手里抽回，捂住了自己的眼睛。所有持重的感情和女性贞操的感情又回到这个心灵之中……“好吧！让我丢脸吧！”她终于叹了口气说，“这就是保证。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Yesterday  I was happy, because I had the courage to be severe with myself,' thought  Julien. After a brief interval of silence, he gained sufficient mastery over  his heart to say in an icy tone:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“昨天我是幸福的，因为我有勇气严厉地对待我自己，”于连想。他沉默了片刻，他还能控制他的心，就以一种冷冰冰的口吻说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Once  we are on the road to London, once you are disgraced, to use your own words,  who can promise me that you will love me? That my company in the postchaise  will not seem to you an annoyance? I am not a monster, to have ruined your  reputation will be to me only an additional grief. It is not your position in  society that is the obstacle, it is unfortunately your own nature. Can you  promise yourself that you will love me for a week? '(Ah! Let her love me for a  week, for a week only,' Julien murmured to himself, 'and I shall die of joy.  What do I care for the future, what do I care for life itself? And this divine  happiness may begin at this moment if I choose, it depends entirely upon myself!)'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“一旦踏上去伦敦的路，用您的话说，一旦丢了脸，谁向我保证您还爱我？谁向我保证我坐在驿车里不让您觉得讨厌？我不是一个怪物，  让您名誉扫地，我只是又多了一个不幸。成为障碍的不是您的社会地位，真不幸，是您的性格。您能向您自己保证爱我一个礼拜吗？”（“啊！让她爱我一个礼拜，仅仅一个礼拜，”于连低声对自己说，“然后我就幸福地死去。未来于我何干？生命于我何干？如果我愿意，这幸福立刻就能开始，完全取决于我！”）</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Mathilde saw him turn pensive.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德看见他在沉思。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>'So  I am altogether unworthy of you,' she said, clasping his hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“这么说，我完全配不上您了，”她握着他的手说。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  embraced her, but at once the iron hand of duty gripped his heart. 'If she sees  how I adore her, then I lose her.' And, before with drawing himself from her  arms, he had resumed all the dignity that befits a man.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连抱住了她，然而就在这时，责任的铁手抓住了他的心。“如果她看出来我多么崇拜她，我又会失去她。”于是，他又拿出了一个男子  汉应有的全部尊严，推开了她的胳膊。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  that day and the days that followed, he managed to conceal the intensity of his  bliss; there were moments in which he denied himself even the pleasure of  clasping her in his arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当天和以后的许多天里，他知道如何把他那过度的幸福藏住，有时候，他甚至放弃了把她抱在怀里的快乐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  other moments, the frenzy of happiness swept aside all the counsels of  prudence. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>但是有时候，幸福的狂热又压倒了谨慎发出的种种告诫。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was beside a bower of honeysuckle arranged so as to hide the  ladder, in the garden, that he was accustomed to take his stand in order to  gaze at the distant shutters of Mathilde's window and lament her inconstancy.  An oak of great size stood close by, and the trunk of this tree prevented him  from being seen by indiscreet persons.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>花园里有一个藏梯子的金银花廊，他常去那儿远望玛蒂尔德的百叶窗，悲叹她的变化无常。旁边有一株很大的橡树，树干正好挡住他，不  让那些好事之徒看见。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  he passed with Mathilde by this spot which recalled to him so vividly the  intensity of his grief, the contrast between past despair and present bliss was  too strong for him; tears flooded his eyes, and, carrying to his lips the hand  of his mistress: 'Here I lived while I thought of you; from here I gazed at  that shutter, I awaited for hours on end the fortunate moment when I should see  this hand open it… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他和玛蒂尔德走过这个使他如此清晰地回想起他那极度不幸的地方，往日的绝望和眼下的幸福对比太强烈了，他的性格实在受不了，泪水不禁涌上了眼睛，他把女友的手拉近嘴唇，说：“这里，我曾思念着您度过我的时光；这里，我曾望着那扇百叶窗，几个钟头地等待着我能看见这只手打开它的那个幸运的时刻……”</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  gave way completely. He portrayed to her, in those true colours which one does  not invent, the intensity of his despair at that time. In spasmodic utterances  he spoke of his present happiness which had put an end to that cruel suffering…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>他的心完全地软了。他用绝非臆造的色彩向她描绘他当时的极度绝望。简短的感叹证明了眼下的幸福，这幸福结束了那残酷的痛苦……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  am I doing, Great God!' said Julien, coming suddenly to his senses. 'I am  destroying everything.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我在干什么呀，伟大的天主！”于连突然醒了过来。“我完了。”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  the height of his alarm he thought he already saw less love in the eyes of  Mademoiselle de La Mole. This was an illusion; but Julien's face changed  rapidly and was flooded with a deathly pallor. His eyes grew dull for a moment,  and an expression of arrogance not devoid of malice succeeded that of the most  sincere, the most wholehearted love.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>在这种过分的警觉中，他相信已经看见德·拉莫尔小姐眼中的爱情正在减弱。那是幻觉，然而，于连迅速地变了脸，蒙上了一重死一般的  苍白。他的眼睛一下子暗淡了，一种不无恶意的高傲的表情很快取代了最真实、最自然的爱的表情。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Why,  what is the matter with you, dear?' Mathilde tenderly, anxiously inquired.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您怎么了，我的朋友？”玛蒂尔德温柔而不安地问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am lying,' said Julien savagely, 'and I am lying to you. I reproach myself for  it, and yet God knows that I respect you sufficiently not to lie.You  love me, you are devoted to me, and I have no need to make fine speeches in  order to please you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我在说谎，”于连恼怒地说，“我在对您说谎。我谴责我自己，但是天主知道我尊敬您，不应该说谎。您爱我，您忠于我，我不需要花  言巧语讨您喜欢。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Great  God! They were only fine speeches, all the exquisite things you have been  saying to me for the last ten minutes?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“伟大的天主！您刚才对我说的那些令人心醉的话都是花言巧语？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  I reproach myself for them strongly, dear friend. I made them up long ago for a  woman who loved me and used to bore me… That is the weak spot in my character,  I denounce myself to you, forgive me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我强烈地谴责这些话，亲爱的朋友。那都是我过去为了一个爱我却讨厌的女人编造出来的……这是我的性格的缺点，我向您坦白，饶恕  我吧。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Bitter  tears streamed down Mathilde's cheeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>痛苦的泪水流满了玛蒂尔德的脸颊。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Whenever  some trifle that has shocked me sets me dreaming for a moment,' Julien went on,  'my execrable memory, which I could curse at this moment, offers me a way of  escape, and I abuse it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“只要有一点点小事让我不快，我就不由自主地再想一阵，”于连说，“我那可恶的记忆力，我现在诅咒它，就向我提供一个理由，而我  也就加以滥用。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'So  I have unconsciously done something that has displeased you?' said Mathilde  with a charming simplicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“难道我刚刚无意中做了让您不高兴的事吗？”玛蒂尔德带着可爱的天真说道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  day, I remember, as you passed by these honeysuckles, you plucked a flower, M.  de Luz took it from you, and you let him keep it. I was close beside you.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我记得，有一天，您走过这金银花廊时摘了一朵花，德·吕兹先生从您的手里拿过去，您就让他拿了。我正在两步之外。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'M.  de Luz? It is impossible,' replied Mathilde with the dignity that came so  naturally to her: 'I never behave like that.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“德·吕兹先主？不可能，”玛蒂尔德带着她那如此自然的高傲说，“我绝不会那样做。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am certain of it,' Julien at once rejoined.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我肯定，”于连激烈地反驳道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah,  well! Then it must be true, dear,' said Mathilde, lowering her eyes sadly. She  was positive that for many months past she had never allowed M. de Luz to take  any such liberty.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“那好吧！的确如此，我的朋友，”玛蒂尔德难过地垂下眼睛。她明明知道，几个月以来，她不曾允许德·吕兹先生有这样的举动。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  gazed at her with an inexpressible tenderness:'No,'  he said to himself, 'she does not love me any the less.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连怀着一种无法形容的温情望着她：“不，”他对自己说，“她还是那样爱我。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  rebuked him that evening, with a laugh, for his fondness for Madame de  Fervaques: a bourgeois in love with a parvenue. 'Hearts of that class are  perhaps the only ones that my Julien cannot inflame. She has turned you into a  regular dandy,' she said, playing with his hair.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上，她笑着责备他对德·费瓦克夫人的兴趣：“一个市民爱一个新贵！也许只有此种人的心，我的于连不能使之发疯。她把您变成了一  个真正的浪荡子，”她一边说，一边玩着他的头发。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>During  the period in which he supposed himself to be scorned by Mathilde, Julien had  become one of the best-dressed men in Paris. But he had an additional advantage  over the other men of this sort; once his toilet was performed, he never gave  it another thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连在自认受到玛蒂尔德蔑视的那段时间里，成了巴黎穿戴最讲究的男人之一。即便如此，他仍然胜过此类人一筹；他一旦打扮好，就不再想了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  thing still vexed Mathilde. Julien continued to copy out the Russian letters,  and to send them to the Marechale.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有一件事仍令玛蒂尔德恼火，于连还在抄俄国人的信，并送给元帅夫人。
