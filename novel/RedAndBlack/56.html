<p>There  also was of course in Adeline That calm patrician polish in the address, Which  ne'er can pass the equinoctial line Of anything which nature would express;  Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine, At least his manner suffers not to guess  That anything he views can greatly please.</p>
<p>Don Juan, XIII. 34</p></div>

<p>当然有阿得玲身上也有一种在说话时不慌不忙的贵族式的圆滑，她决不会超过大自然愿意再现出来的任何事物的平分线，正如清朝官吏觉得什么东西不好，至少他的态度不让人猜出他所看到的东西能使他感到极大的欢喜。</p>
<p>《唐璜》，第十三歌，三十四节</p></div>

  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left"><p>'There  is a trace of madness in the way the whole of this family have of looking at  things,' thought the Marechale; 'they are infatuated with their little abbe,  who can do nothing but sit and stare at one; it is true, his eyes are not  bad-looking.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“这家人看人看事的方式有点儿疯狂，”元帅夫人想，“他们都迷上了他们的年轻神甫，他就知道听，眼睛倒真地挺美。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien,  for his part, found in the Marechale's manner an almost perfect example of that  patrician calm which betokens a scrupulous politeness and still more the  impossibility of any keen emotion. Any sudden out-burst, a want of selfcontrol,  would have shocked Madame de Fervaques almost as much as a want of dignity  towards one's inferiors. The least sign of sensibility would have been in her  eyes like a sort of moral intoxication for which one ought to blush, and which  was highly damaging to what a person of exalted rank owed to herself. Her great  happiness was to speak of the King's latest hunt, her favourite book the  Memoires du ducde Saint Simon, especially the genealogical part.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连呢，他在元帅夫人的态度中找到了贵族的沉静的近乎完美的典型，透出一种准确无误的礼貌，还有任何强烈的感情之不可能。意外的情绪波动，缺乏自制，几乎都会使德·费瓦克夫人感到愤慨，如同对下人没有威严一样。同情心的最微小的表示，在她看来，都是一种应该脸红的精神醉态，会大大损害一个有地位的人的尊严。她的最大幸福是谈论国王最近的一次狩猎，最喜欢的书是《德·圣西蒙公爵回忆录》，尤其是家系部分。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  knew the place in the drawing-room which, as the lights were arranged, suited  the style of beauty of Madame de Fervaques. He would be there waiting for her,  but took great care to turn his chair so that he should not be able to see  Mathilde. Astonished by this persistence in hiding from her, one evening she  left the blue sofa and came to work at a little table that stood by the  Marquise's armchair. Julien could see her at quite a close range from beneath  the brim of Madame de Fervaques's hat.Those  eyes, which governed his destiny, frightened him at first, seen at such close  range, then jerked him violently out of his habitual apathy; he talked, and  talked very well.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连知道，根据光线的分布，哪个位置对欣赏德·费瓦克夫人那种类型的美最为适宜。他先占了那个位置，但是细心地转动椅子，直到看不见玛蒂尔德。她很奇怪他这样一直躲着她，有一天，她离开蓝色长沙发，到挨着元帅夫人的扶手椅的一张小桌子旁做女红。于连可以从德·费瓦克夫人的帽榆底下相当近地看见她。那双决定他命运的眼睛，起初使他害怕，接着猛地把他从平时的冷漠中拖了出来；他说话了，而且谈锋极健。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  addressed himself to the Marechale, but his sole object was to influence the  heart of Mathilde. He grew so animated that finally Madame de Fervaques could  not understand what he said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他跟元帅夫人说话，但他唯一的目的是对玛蒂尔德的心灵产生影响。他那么兴奋，直说得德·费瓦克夫人听了莫明其妙。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  was so much to the good. Had it occurred to Julien to follow it up with a few  expressions of German mysticism, religious fervour and Jesuitry, the Marechale  would have numbered him straightway among the superior persons called to  regenerate the age.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>这算是初步的成绩。如果于连灵机一动，加上点几德国神秘主义，高超的宗教信仰和耶稣会教义，元帅夫人就会立刻把他列入被召来改造  时代的高人之中了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p> 'Since  he shows such bad taste,' Mademoiselle de La Mole said to herself, 'as to talk  for so long and with such fervour to Madame de Fervaques, I shall not listen to  him any more.' For the rest of the evening she kept her word, albeit with  difficulty.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“既然他的趣味这样低劣，”德·拉莫尔小姐心想，“竟跟德·费瓦克夫人说得这么久，这么热烈，我就再也不听他说话了。”这天晚上直到人散，她居然说到做到了，尽管费了点劲儿。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At  midnight, when she took up her mother's candlestick, to escort her to her room,  Madame de La Mole stopped on the stairs to utter a perfect panegyric of Julien.  This completed Mathilde's ill humour; she could not send herself to sleep. A  thought came to her which soothed her: 'The things that I despise may even be  great distinctions in the Marechale's eyes.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>夜半，她替母亲端着蜡烛盘，送她回卧房，到了门口，德·拉莫尔夫人站住了，盛赞于连。玛蒂尔德终于恼了，她睡不着觉了，她想了想，又平静下来：“我蔑视的东西依然可以造就元帅夫人眼中的出类拔萃之人。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As  for Julien, he had now taken action, he was less wretched; his eyes happened to  fall on the Russia leather portfolio in which Prince Korasoff had placed the  fifty-three love letters of which he had made him a present. Julien saw a note  at the foot of the first letter: 'Send No. 1 a week after the first meeting.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>至于于连，他行动了，不那么痛苦了；他的目光无意间落在那个俄罗斯羊皮文件包上，里面放着科拉索夫亲王送给他的五十三封情书。于连看见第一封信下端有一注：第—次见面后一个礼拜送出一号信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am late!' exclaimed Julien, 'for it is ever so long now since I first met  Madame de Fervaques.' He set to work at once to copy out this first love  letter; it was a homily stuffed with phrases about virtue, and of a deadly  dullness; Julien was fortunate in falling asleep over the second page.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我已经晚了！”于连叫起来，“我看见德·费瓦克夫人已经很长时间了。”他立即动手抄第一封情书，那是一篇说教，充满卫道的陈辞滥调，讨厌得要命；于连抄到第二页就呼呼地睡着了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Some  hours later the risen sun surprised him crouching with his head on the table. One  of the most painful moments of his life was that in which, every morning, as he  awoke, he discovered his distress. This morning, he finished copying his letter  almost with a laugh. 'Is it possible,' he asked himself, 'that there can ever  have been a young man who could write such stuff?' He counted several sentences  of nine lines. At the foot of the original he caught sight of a pencilled note.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>几个种头之后，大太阳把他照醒，他还趴在桌子上呢。他一生中最难受的时刻之一，就是这每天早晨醒来的时候，这时他又意识到自已的不幸，这一天，他却几乎是笑着把信抄完。他对自己说：“难道可能有年轻人这样写信吗？”他数了数，长达九行的句子有好几个。在原信下方，他看见有一铅笔写的注：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'One  delivers these letters oneself: on horseback, a black cravat, a blue greatcoat.  ????? One hands the letter to the porter  with a contrite air; profound melancholy in the gaze. If one should see a  lady's maid, wipe the eyes furtively. Address a few words to the maid.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>本人亲自送信：骑马，黑领带，蓝色常礼服。带着悔恨的神情将信交给门房；目光要含着深深的忧郁。若看见贴身女仆，要愉偷地抹眼泪，跟贴身女仆说话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>All  these instructions were faithfully carried out.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一切都照办无误。<br />
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  I am doing is very bold,' thought Julien, as he rode away from the Hotel de  Fervaques, 'but so much the worse for Korasoff. To dare write to so notorious a  prude! I am going to be treated with the utmost contempt, and nothing will  amuse me more. This is, really, the only form of comedy to which I can respond.  Yes, to cover with ridicule that odious being whom I call myself will amuse me.  If I obeyed my instincts I should commit some crime for the sake of  distraction.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

　　
“我真是胆大妄为，”于连走出德·费瓦克府时想，“活该科拉索夫倒霉。竟敢给一个如此著名的有德女人写信！我将受到她极端的轻蔑  ，不过倒是再没有比这更让我开心的了。实际上，我能够有所感觉的也就是这种喜剧了。是的，这个丑恶的家伙，我称之为我，让他成为笑柄，会令我开心的。我要是自以为了不起，为了消愁破闷，我会去犯罪的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  a month past, the happiest moment in Julien's day had been that in which he  brought his horse back to the stables. Korasoff had expressly forbidden him to  look, upon any pretext whatsoever, at the mistress who had abandoned him. But  the paces of that horse which she knew so well, the way in which Julien rapped  with his whip at the stable door to summon a groom, sometimes drew Mathilde to  stand behind her window curtain. The muslin was so fine that Julien could see  through it. By looking up in a certain way from under the brim of his hat, he  caught a glimpse of Mathilde's form without seeing her eyes. 'Consequently,' he  told himself, 'she cannot see mine, and this is not the same as looking at  her.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一个月以来，于连生活中最美好的时刻，就是他把马牵回马厩的时候。科拉索夫明确禁止他在任何借口下看离他而去的情妇。然而她熟悉那匹马的蹄声，熟悉于连用马鞭敲马厩的门叫人的方式，这有时就把玛蒂尔德吸引到窗帘后面来。细布窗帘很薄，于连可以看过去。从帽根底下想个办法，他可以看看她的身体而不看她的眼睛。“这样，”他对自己说，“她看不见我的眼睛，就不是我看她啦。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>That  evening, Madame de Fervaques behaved to him exactly as though she had not  received the philosophical, mystical and religious dissertation which, in the  morning, he had handed to her porter with such an air of melancholy. The  evening before, chance had revealed to Julien the secret springs of eloquence;  he arranged himself so as to be able to see Mathilde's eyes. She, meanwhile, immediately  after the arrival of the Marechale, rose from the blue sofa: this was a  desertion of her regular company. M. de Croisenois showed consternation at this  new caprice; his evident distress relieved Julien of the keenest pangs of his  own sufferings.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上，德·费瓦克夫人看见他，就好像她根本没收到他早晨神情忧郁地交给门房的那篇哲学的、神秘的、宗教的论文。头天晚上，于连偶然发现了侃侃而谈的诀窍，他于是安排好自己的位置，能够看见玛蒂尔德的眼睛。她呢，则在元帅夫人到后不久，离开了蓝色长沙发：这是从她那个平时的小圈子里开小差啊。德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦看到这种新的任性举动，不免灰心丧气；他的显而易见的痛苦把于连残酷的不幸一扫而光。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  unexpected turn in his affairs made him talk like an angel; and as self-esteem  finds its way even into hearts that serve as temples to the most august virtue:  'Madame de La Mole is right,' the Marechale said to herself, as she stepped  into her carriage, 'that young priest has distinction. My presence must, at  first, have frightened him. Indeed, everything that one finds in that house is  very frivolous; all the virtue I see there is the result of age, and stood in  great need of the congealing hand of time.That  young man must have seen the difference; he writes well; but I am much afraid  that the request that I should enlighten him with my advice,which he makes in  his letter, is in reality only a sentiment unaware of itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他生活中出现的这一意外，使他说起话来像个天使；即便一个人的心作了最严峻的道德的殿堂，自尊心也能溜进去，所以，元帅夫人上车时心想：“德·拉莫尔夫人有道理，这小教士与众不同。开头几天，大概是我的在场把他吓着了。事实上，在这个家里遇见的人都很轻浮；我只看见一些因年老色衰才变得有道德的女人，她们很需要年龄结成的冰块。这个年轻人该能看出区别；他的信写得很好，但是我很担心，他在信中求我指点迷津，实际上不过是一种不自知的感情罢了。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  yet, how many conversions have begun in this way! What leads me to augur well  of this one is the difference in his style from that of the young men whose  letters I have had occasion to see. It is impossible not to recognise unction,  a profound earnestness and great conviction in the prose of this young Levite;  he must have the soothing virtue of Massillon.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“然而多少人皈依天主就是这样开始的啊！这个人的情况我觉得有希望，他的风格和有些年轻人的风格不同，我曾有机会见过他们写的信。不能不承认这年轻教士的文章中有热忱、深刻的严肃和坚定的信念，他会有马西庸的温和的美德的。”
