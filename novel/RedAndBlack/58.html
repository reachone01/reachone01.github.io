  <div class="left"><p>The  Russian instructions laid down categorically that one must never contradict in  speech the person with whom one corresponded.

<p>One  evening, at the Opera, in Madame de Fervaques's box, Julien praised to the  skies the ballet in Manon Lescaut.His  sole reason for doing so was that he found it insipid.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>一天晚上，在歌剧院，在德·费瓦克夫人的包厢里，于连把《曼侬·莱斯戈》捧上了天。他这样说的唯一理由乃是因为他觉得这出戏一钱不值。</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  Marechale said that this ballet was greatly inferior to abbe Prevost's novel.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>元帅夫人说这出芭蕾舞剧比普列服神甫的小说差得远。</p>
　　

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!'  thought Julien, with surprise and amusement, 'a person of such extreme virtue  praise a novel!' Madame de Fervaques used to profess, two or three times  weekly, the most utter scorn for the writers, who, by means of those vulgar  works, sought to corrupt a younger generation only too prone to the errors of  the senses.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！”于连想，又惊讶，又开心，“一个道德如此高尚的女人竟吹捧一本小说！”德·费瓦克夫人每礼拜总有两三次对作家极尽轻蔑  之能事，说他们企图借助此等平庸的作品腐蚀青年，这些青年，唉！太容易犯肉欲方面的错误了。</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  that immoral and pernicious class, Manon Lescaut,' the Marechale went on,  'occupies, they say, one of the first places. The frailties and well merited  sufferings of a thoroughly criminal heart are, they say, described in it with a  truth that is almost profound; which did not prevent your Bonaparte from  declaring on Saint Helena that it was a novel written for servants.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在这种不道德的、危险的体裁中，《曼依·莱斯戈》，”元帅夫人继续说，”据说是属于第一流的。一颗罪恶深重的心的软弱和理应感到的痛苦，据说被描写得很真实，而这种真实亦颇有深度；不过，您的波拿巴仍然在圣赫勒拿岛宣称这是一部写给仆人看的小说。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  speech restored all its activity to Julien's spirit. 'People have been trying  to damage me with the Marechale; they have told her of?? enthusiasm for Napoleon. This intelligence has stung her  sufficiently for her to yield to the temptation to let me feel her resentment.'  This discovery kept him amused for the rest of the evening and made him  amusing.As  he was bidding the Marechale good night in the vestibule of the Opera: 'Bear in  mind, Sir,' she said to him, 'that people must not love Napoleon when they love  me; they may, at the most, accept him as a necessity imposed by Providence.  Anyhow, the man had not a soul pliant enough to feel great works of art.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这句话让于连的精神紧张地活动起来。“有人想在元帅夫人面前毁掉我，有人告诉了她我对拿破仑的热情。这件事她很恼火，忍不住要让我有所感觉。”这个发现让他一个晚上都很开心，人也变得有趣了。他在歌剧院向元帅夫人告别时，她对他说：“记住，先生，一个人如果爱我，就不应该爱波拿巴；我们只能把他当作天意强迫我们接受的一件不可避免的事物。再说，这个人的心灵太僵硬，不能欣赏艺术杰作。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'When  they love me!' Julien repeated to himself; 'either that means nothing at all,  or it means everything. There is one of the secrets of language that are hidden  from us poor provincials.' And he thought incessantly of Madame de Renal as he  copied an immensely long letter intended for the Marechale.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“—个人如果爱我！”于连在心里重复道，“这句话要么毫无意义，要么一切尽在其中。我们可怜的外省人就是掌握不了这种语言的奥秘。”他深深地怀念德·莱纳夫人，一边抄写一封给元帅夫人的很长很长的信。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  is it,' she asked him the following evening, with an air of indifference which  seemed to him unconvincing, 'that you speak to me of London and Richmond in a  letter which you wrote last night, it appears,after leaving the Opera?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么搞的”，第二天她对他说，于连一眼就看出她假装冷淡，“您在咋天晚上，看来是离开歌剧院以后写的一封信里，怎么跟我谈起伦敦和里奇蒙来了？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Julien  was greatly embarrassed; he had copied the letter line for line, without  thinking of what he was writing, and apparently had forgotten to substitute for  the words London and Richmond, which occurred in the original, Paris and  SaintCloud. He began two or three excuses, but found it impossible to finish  any of them; he felt himself on the point of giving way to an outburst of  helpless laughter. At length, in his search for the right words, he arrived at the  following idea: 'Exalted by the discussion of the most sublime, the highest  interests of the human soul, my own, in writing to you, must have become  distracted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连很尴尬。他逐行地抄，没有想写的是什么，看来是忘了用巴黎和圣克鲁替换原信中的伦敦和里奇蒙。他开始了两个或三个句子，但怎么也结束不了，他觉得马上要发疯般大笑起来。最后，他搜索枯肠，好不容易来了个主意，说：“讨论人类灵魂的最崇高、最重大的利益，令我非常激动。写着写着，我的灵魂可能一时走神了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am creating an impression,' he said to himself, 'therefore I can spare myself  the tedium of the rest of the evening.' He left the Hotel de Fervaques in hot  haste. That evening, as he looked over the original text of the letter which he  had copied the night before, he very soon came to the fatal passage where the  young Russian spoke of London and Richmond.Julien  was quite surprised to find this letter almost tender.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我给她留下了印象，”他心想，“今晚可不必再受烦闷的罪了。”他一溜小跑，出了德·费瓦克府。回去后，他重读头天夜里抄的原信，很快找到俄国人谈伦敦和里奇激的那个要命的地方。于连发现这封信算得上柔情缱绻，颇感惊奇。</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was the contrast between the apparent frivolity of his talk and the sublime and  almost apocalyptic profundity of his letters that had marked him out. The  length of his sentences was especially pleasing to the Marechale; this was not  the cursory style brought into fashion by Voltaire, that most immoral of men!  Although our hero did everything in the world to banish any suggestion of  common sense from his conversation,it had still an antimonarchical and impious  colour which did not escape the notice of Madame de Fervaques. Surrounded by  persons who were eminently moral, but who often had not one idea in an evening,  this lady was profoundly impressed by everything that bore a semblance of  novelty; but, at the same time, she felt that she owed it to herself to be  shocked by it. She called this defect, 'retaining the imprint of the frivolity  of the age'.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的话表面上很轻浮，而他的信却具有崇高的、近乎启示录那样的深刻，这种对比使他不同凡响。长句子尤其令元帅夫人喜欢，“这不是伏尔奉那个如此不道德的人使之风行的那种一蹦一跳的风格！”尽管我们的主人公竭力把一切合乎常情常理的东西从谈话中消除出去，他的谈话仍有一种反王政、不信神的色彩，没有逃过德·费瓦克夫人的眼睛。这位夫人身边尽是极有道德的人，然而他们不是每天晚上都有新思想，所以，凡是有几分像新事物的东西都能给她留下强烈的印象；不过同时她又认为自己理应对这些东西感到愤慨。她把这种缺点称作“打上了这个轻浮时代的印记”……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  such drawing-rooms are worth visiting only when one has a favour to ask. All  the boredom of this life without interests which Julien was leading is  doubtless shared by the reader. These are the barren moorlands on our journey.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>但是这样的客厅，除非有事相求，否则不值一顾。于连的这种生活真是无趣，他所感到的厌倦想必读者亦有同感。此乃我们旅途中的一片荒原。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Throughout  the time usurped in Julien's life by the Fervaques episode, Mademoiselle de La  Mole had to make a constant effort not to think of him. Her heart was exposed  to violent combats: sometimes she flattered herself that she was despising this  gloomy young man; but, in spite of her efforts, his conversation captivated  her. What astonished her most of all was his complete insincerity; he never  uttered a word to the Marechale which was not a lie, or at least a shocking  travesty of his point of view, which Mathilde knew so perfectly upon almost  every subject. This Machiavellism impressed her. 'What profundity!' she said to  herself;'how different from the emphatic blockheads or the common rascals, like  M. Tanbeau, who speak the same language!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>在于连的生活中被费瓦克插曲占去的这段时间里，德·拉莫尔小姐一直需要克制自己，不去想他。她的灵魂中进行着激烈的搏斗，有时候，她庆幸能够蔑视这位如此愁苦的年轻人了；然而，她又身不由己地被他的谈话俘获了。尤其使她感到惊奇的，竟是他那十足的虚假。他对元帅夫人说的句句是谎言，或者至少是他的思想方式的一种丑恶的伪装，因为他在几乎所有问题上的看法，玛蒂尔德都一清二楚。这种马基雅维里主义令她感到震惊。“多么深刻啊！”她对自己说，“跟持有相同论调的唐博先生那样的夸夸其谈的傻瓜或者平庸粗俗的骗子相比，又是多么不同啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Nevertheless,  Julien passed some fearful days. It was to perform the most arduous of his  duties that he appeared each evening in the Marechale's drawing-room. His  efforts to play a part ended by sapping all his spiritual strength. Often, at  night, as he crossed the vast courtyard of the Hotel de Fervaques, it was only  by force of character and reason that he succeeded in keeping himself from  sinking into despair.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而，于连却有些可怕的日子。为了履行最艰难的职责，他每天都得在元帅夫人的客厅里露面。他为了扮演一个角色而付出的努力终于使他的心灵疲惫不堪。夜里，他穿过德·费瓦克府的巨大的院子时，常常是靠着性格的、理智的力量才免于陷入绝望。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  conquered despair at the Seminary,' he said to himself: 'and yet what an  appalling prospect I had before me then! I stood to make my fortune or to fail;  in either case, I saw myself obliged to spend my whole life in the intimate  society of all that is most contemptible and disgusting under heaven. The  following spring, when only eleven short months had passed, I was perhaps the  happiest of all the young men of my age.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我在神学院里战胜了绝望，”他对自己说，“而那时我的前景是多么可怕啊！我或是飞黄腾达，或是横遭厄运，无论是哪种情况，我都必须和天底下最可鄙、最可厌的人朝夕相处，度过我的一生。第二年春天，短短的十一个月以后，我成了也许是我那个年纪的年轻人中最幸福的一个。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  often enough all these fine arguments proved futile when faced with the  frightful reality. Every day he saw Mathilde at luncheon and at dinner. From  the frequent letters which M. de La Mole dictated to him, he knew her to be on  the eve of marrying M. de Croisenois. Already that amiable young man was  calling twice daily at the Hotel de La Mole: the jealous eye of an abandoned  lover did not miss a single one of his actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>但是，这些严密的推理碰上可怕的现实，往往不起作用。他每天都在吃午饭和吃晚饭的时候看见玛蒂尔德。从德·拉莫尔先生口授的许多信稿中，他知道她就要跟德·克鲁瓦泽努瓦先生结为夫妇了。这个可爱的年轻人已经每天两次来德·拉莫尔府上了；一个遭到冷落的情人的嫉妒的眼睛没有放过他的一举一动。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  he thought he had noticed that Mademoiselle de La Mole was treating her suitor  kindly, on returning to his room, Julien could not help casting a loving glance  at his pistols.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>当于连以为看出德·拉莫尔小姐善待她的未婚夫时，回到房里以后，他就情不自禁地深情地望着他的手枪。</p>


</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah,  how much wiser I should be,' he said to himself, 'to remove the marks from my  linen, and retire to some lonely forest, twenty leagues from Paris, there to  end this accursed existence! A stranger to the countryside, my death would  remain unknown for a fortnight, and who would think of me after a fortnight had  passed?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“啊！”他对自己说，“把内衣的标志去掉，到个距巴黎二十里远的什么僻静的森林里，结束我这可憎的一生，不是更明智吗！当地没有  人认识我，我的死半个月内不会有人知道，而半个月后谁会想到我呢！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  reasoning was extremely sound. But next day, a glimpse of Mathilde's arm, seen  between her sleeve and her glove, was enough to plunge our young philosopher in  cruel memories, which, at the same time, made him cling to life. 'Very well!'  he would then say to himself, 'I shall follow out this Russian policy to the  end. How is it going to end?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这番推理很明智。然而第二天，隐约看见玛蒂尔德的胳膊，只消袖口和手套之间那一段就足以把我们这位年轻的哲人投进残酷的回忆中去，而正是这回忆使他还留恋人生。“好吧！”他这时就对自己说，“我要把俄国人的策略坚持到底。那会怎样结束呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'As  for the Marechale, certainly, after I have copied these fiftythree letters, I  shall write no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“至于元帅夫人，抄完这五十三封信，我当然不会再写别的信了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'As  for Mathilde, these six weeks of such painful playacting, will either fail  altogether to appease her anger, or will win me a moment of reconciliation.  Great God! I should die of joy!' And he was unable to pursue the idea farther.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“至于玛蒂尔德，如此艰难地演了六个礼拜的戏，或是她的愤怒丝毫无改，或是我得到片刻的和解。伟大的天主啊！那我会高兴死了！”  他想不下去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When,  after a long spell of meditation, he succeeded in recovering the use of his  reason: 'Then,' he said to himself, 'I should obtain a day's happiness, after  which would begin again her severities, founded, alas, upon the scant power  that I have to please her, and I should be left without any further resource, I  should be ruined, lost for ever…</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>大梦之后，他又能推理了，就对自己说：“那么，我会得到一天的幸福，然后她的冷酷重新开始，唉！就是因为我不能讨得她的欢心；那我就什么办法也没有了，我毁了，永远地完了……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  guarantee can she give me, with her character? Alas, my scant merit is  responsible for everything. I must be wanting in elegance in my manners, my way  of speaking must be heavy and monotonous. Great God! Why am I myself?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“她有那样的性格，能给我什么保证呢？唉！我一无长处，这就回答了一切。我举止不高雅，我谈吐笨拙而单调。伟大的天主啊！为什么我是我呢？”
