<p>The country will remember this celebrated  trial for a long time to come. Interest in the accused reached fever pitch;  this was because his crime was astonishing and yet not atrocious. Even if it had  been, the young man was so handsome! His great destiny abruptly cut short  heightened the pity felt for him. Will he be condemned? the women would ask the  men of their acquaintance and one could see them grow pale as they awaited the  reply.</p>
<p>SAINTE BEUVE</p></div>
<div class="right quo1 ">
<p>当地的人将长久地记着这桩出名的诉讼案件。对被告的屿甚至引起了骚动，这是因为他的罪行是惊人的，但是并不残忍，可这个年轻要是那么漂亮啊！他的辉煌的前程即将结束，更增加了人们的同情。“他们会判他死刑吗？”妇女们问她们熟识的男人；可以看出，她们在等待回答时，脸色变得苍白。</p>

<p>At length the day dawned so dreaded by  Madame de Renal and Mathilde.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人和玛蒂尔德如此害怕的那一天终于来了。</p>


</div></div>  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">
<p>The strange appearance of the town increased their  terror, and did not leave even Fouque's stout heart unmoved. The whole Province  had swarmed into Besancon to witness the trial of this romantic case.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>城市的样子变得怪异，更增加了她们的恐惧，连富凯那颗坚强的心也不免为之所动。人们从全省的四面八方赶来贝藏松，观看如何审理这桩桃色案件。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  some days past there had not been a bed to be had in the inns. The President of  the Assize Court was assailed with requests for cards of admission; all the  ladies of the town wished to be present at the trial; Julien's portrait was  hawked through the streets, etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>几天前旅馆就都客满了。刑事法庭庭长先生受到讨旁听券的人包围，城里的女士们都想旁听审判，街上在叫卖于连的肖像，等等，等等。</p>

<p>Mathilde  was keeping in reserve for this supreme moment a letter written throughout in  the hand of the Lord Bishop of ——. This Prelate, who controlled the Church in  France and appointed Bishops, deigned to ask for the acquittal of Julien. On  the eve of the trial, Mathilde took this letter to the all-powerful Vicar-General.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德为了这关键时刻，还留了一封德·某某主教大人的亲笔信。这位领导法国天主教会，执掌任免主教大权的高级神职人员竟肯屈尊请求赦免于连。审判的前一天，玛蒂尔德把这封信交给了权力极大的代理主教。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>At the  close of the interview, as she was leaving the room in a flood of tears: 'I  answer for the verdict of the jury,' M. de Frilair told her, emerging at length  from his diplomatic reserve, and almost showing signs of emotion himself.  'Among the twelve persons charged with the duty of finding whether your  protege's crime is proven, and especially whether there was premeditation, I  number six friends devoted to my welfare, and I have given them to understand  that it rested with them to raise me to the episcopate. Baron de Valenod, whom  I have made Mayor of Verrieres, has entire control over two of his  subordinates, MM. de Moirod and de Cholin. To tell the truth, chance has given  us, for dealing with this affair, two jurors who are extremely disaffected;  but, although Ultra-Liberals, they loyally obey my orders on great occasions,  and I have sent word asking them to vote with M. Valenod. I learn that a sixth  juror of the industrial class, an immensely rich and garrulous Liberal, is  secretly hoping for a contract from the Ministry of War, and no doubt he would  not wish to vex me. I have let him know that M. Valenod has my last word.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>会晤结束，德·福利莱先生见她离开时泪流满面，就说：“我可以担保陪审团的裁决，”他终于抛掉他那外交家的含蓄，自己也几乎受了感动。“有十二个人负责审查您要保护的人的罪行是否确实，尤其是否有预谋，其中有六个是朋友，忠于我们的事业，我已暗示他们，我能不能当主教全靠他们了。瓦勒诺男爵是我让他当上维里埃的市长的，他完全控制着他的两个下属，德·莫瓦诺先生和德·肖兰先生。当然，抽签也为我们这桩案子弄出两个思想极不端正的陪审官，不过，他们虽然是极端自由党人，遇有重大场合，还是忠实执行我的命令的，我已让人请求他们投和瓦勒诺先生一样的票。我已获悉第六位陪审官是个工业家，非常有钱，是个饶舌的自由党人，暗中希望向陆军部供货，毫无疑问，他不想得罪我。我已让人告诉他，瓦勒诺先生知道我有话。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  who is this M. Valenod?' said Mathilde, anxiously.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这位瓦勒诺先生是谁？”玛蒂尔德不安地问。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If you  knew him, you would have no doubt of our success. He is a bold speaker,  impudent, coarse, a man made to be the leader of fools.1814 raised him from  penury, and I am going to make him a Prefect. He is capable of thrashing the  other jurors if they refuse to vote as he wishes.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“如果您认识他，您就不会对成功有所怀疑了。这个人能说会道，胆于大，脸皮厚，是个粗人，天生一块领导傻瓜的材料。一八一四年把他从贫困中救出来，我还要让他当省长。如果其他陪审官不随他的意投票，他能揍他们。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Mathilde  was somewhat reassured.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>玛蒂尔德略微放心了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>There  was another discussion in store for her that evening. In order not to prolong a  painful scene, the outcome of which appeared to him certain, Julien was  determined not to open his mouth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>晚上还有一番讨论等着她。于连不想推长一种令人难堪的场面，再说他认为其结局不容置疑，便决定不说话。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  counsel will speak, that is quite sufficient,' he said to Mathilde. 'As it is,  I shall be all too long exposed as a spectacle to my enemies. These provincials  are shocked by the rapid advancement which I owe to you,and, believe me, there  is not one of them that does not wish for my conviction, except that he will  cry like a fool when I am led to the scaffold.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的律师会说活的，这就很够了，”他对玛蒂尔德说，“我在所有这些敌人面前亮相的时间太长了。这些外省人对我靠您而迅速发迹感到恼怒，请相信我，他们没有一个不希望判我死刑的，尽管也可能在我被押赴刑场时像傻瓜似地痛哭流涕。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'They  wish to see you humiliated, it is only too true,' replied Mathilde,'but I do  not believe that they are cruel. My presence in Besancon and the spectacle of  my grief have interested all the women; your handsome face will do the rest. If  you say but one word before your judges, the whole court will be on your side,'  etc., etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他们希望看到您受辱，这是千真万确的，”玛蒂尔德回答道，“但我不相信他们是残酷的。我来到贝藏松，我的痛苦已经公开，这已经引起所有女人的关切，剩下的将由您那漂亮面孔来完成。只要您在法官面前说一句话，听众就都是您的了……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  following morning at nine o'clock, when Julien came down from his prison to  enter the great hall of the Law Courts, it was with the utmost difficulty that  the gendarmes succeeded  in clearing a passage through the immense crowd that packed the courtyard.  Julien had slept well, he was quite calm, and felt no other sentiment than one  of philosophical piety towards this crowd of envious persons who, without cruelty,  were ready to applaud his sentence of death. He was quite surprised when,  having been detained for more than a quarter of an hour among the crowd, he was  obliged to admit that his presence was inspiring a tender pity in the assembly.  He did not hear a single unpleasant remark. 'These provincials are less evil-minded  than I supposed,' he said to himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>第二天九点，于连从牢房下来，去法院的大厅，院子里人山人海，警察们费尽力气才从人群中挤过去。于连睡得很好，镇定自若，对这群嫉妒的人除了旷达的怜悯外，并无别的感情，而他们将为他的死刑判决鼓掌喝彩，但是并不残暴。他在人群中受阻一刻钟，他不能不承认，他的出现在公众中引起一种温柔的同情，这是他始料不及的。他没有听见一句刺耳的话。“这些外省人不像我想的那么坏，”他对自己说。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>On  entering the court, he was struck by the elegance of the architecture. It was  pure gothic, with a number of charming little pillars carved in stone with the  most perfect finish. He imagined himself in England.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>走进审判厅，建筑的优雅使他不胜惊讶。纯粹的哥特式，许多漂亮的小柱子，全部用石头精酸细刻出来。他恍惚到了英国。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>But  presently his whole attention was absorbed in twelve or fifteen pretty women  who, seated opposite the dock, filled the three galleries above the bench and  the jurybox. On turning round towards the public seats, he saw that the  circular gallery which overhung the well of the court was filled with women;  most of them were young and seemed to him extremely pretty; their eyes were  bright and full of interest. In the rest of the court, the crowd was enormous; people  were struggling at the doors, and the sentries were unable to preserve silence.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>然而很快，他的注意力被十二个到十五个漂亮女人吸引住了。她们正对着被告席，把法官和陪审官头顶上的三个包厢塞得满满的。他朝公众转过身，看见梯形审判厅高处的环形旁听席上也满是女人，大部分很年轻，他也觉得很漂亮；她们的眼睛闪闪发亮，充满了关切之情。大厅里剩下的部分更是拥挤不堪，门口已厮打起来，卫兵无法让人们安静。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>When  all the eyes that were looking for Julien became aware of his presence, on  seeing him take his place on the slightly raised bench reserved for the  prisoner, he was greeted with a murmur of astonishment and tender interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>所有的眼睛都在寻找于连，终于发现他来了，一直看着他坐在略高一些的被告的座位上，这时响起嗡嗡一片充满惊奇和温柔的关切的低语声。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  would have said that morning that he was not yet twenty; he was dressed quite  simply, but with a perfect grace; his hair and brow were charming; Mathilde had  insisted on presiding in person over his toilet.His  pallor was intense. As soon as he had taken his seat on the bench, he heard  people say on all sides: 'Lord, how young he is! … ' 'But he is a boy.' 'He is  far better looking than his portrait.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一天他看上去还不到二十岁，他穿着非常朴素，却又风度翩翩；他的头发和前额楚楚动人；玛蒂尔德坚持要亲自替他打扮。于连的脸色极其苍白。他刚在被告席上坐下，就听见四下里到外有人说：“天主！他多年轻！……可这是个孩子啊……他比画像上还要好看。”</p>

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Prisoner,'  said the gendarme seated on his right, 'do you see those six ladies who are on  that balcony?' The gendarme pointed to a little gallery which jutted out above  the amphitheatre in  which the jury was placed.'That  is the Prefect's lady,' the <a href="#" title="美 ['ʒɑn.dɑrm] 英 ['ʒɒn.dɑː(r)m] n.（法国的）警察
网络宪兵；冈达姆；警察在纽约
">gendarme</a> continued; 'next to her, Madame la Marquise  de M ——; that one loves you dearly. I heard her speak to the examining  magistrate. Next to her is Madame Derville.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“被告，”坐在他右边的警察对他说，“您看见那个包厢里的六位夫人吗？”他指给他看陪审官们落座的梯形审判厅上方突出的小旁听席。“那是省长夫人，”警察说，“旁边是德·Ｎ…候爵夫人，她很喜欢您；我听见她跟预审法官说过。再过去是德维尔夫人……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p> 'Madame Derville,' exclaimed  Julien, and a vivid blush suffused his brow. 'When she leaves the court,' he  thought, 'she will write to Madame de Renal.' He knew nothing of Madame de  Renal's arrival at Besancon.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“德维尔夫人！”于连叫了一声，脸胀得通红。“她从这儿出去，”他想，“会写信给德·莱纳夫人的。”他不知道德·莱纳夫人已到了贝藏松。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  witnesses were quickly heard. At the first words of the speech for the  prosecution made by the counsel for the prosecution, two of the ladies seated  on the little balcony burst into tears. 'Madame Derville is not so easily  moved,' thought Julien. He noticed, however, that she was extremely flushed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>证人的发言很快听毕。代理检察长念起诉书，刚念了几句，于连正面小旁听席上的两位夫人眼泪就下来了。“德维尔夫人的心不会这么软，”于连想。不过，他注意到她的脸红得厉害。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  counsel for the prosecution was labouring an emotional point in bad French  about the barbarity of the crime that had been committed; Julien noticed that  Madame Derville's neighbours showed signs of strong disapproval. Several of the  jury, evidently friends of these ladies, spoke to them and seemed to reassure  them. 'That can only be a good sign,' thought Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>代理检察长做悲天悯人状，用蹩脚的法语极力渲染所犯罪行如何野蛮；于连看到德维尔夫人左右几位夫人露出激烈反对的神色。好几位陪审官看来认识这几位夫人，跟她们说话，似乎在劝她们放心。“这不失为一个好兆头，”于连想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Until  then he had felt himself penetrated by an unmixed contempt for all the men who  were taking part in this trial. The insipid eloquence of the counsel for the  prosecution increased this sense of disgust. But gradually the sereneness of  Julien's heart melted before the marks of interest of which he was plainly the  object.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>直到这时，于连一直对参加审判的男人们怀有一种纯粹的轻蔑。代理检察长平庸的口才更增加了这种厌恶的感情。但是，渐渐地，于连内心的冷酷在显然以他为对象的关切表示面前消失了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He was  pleased with the firm expression of his counsel. 'No fine language,' he  murmured to him as he stood up to speak.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他对律师坚定的神情感到满意。“不要玩弄词藻，”他对律师说，律师就要发言了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'All  the emphasis stolen from Bossuet, which has been displayed against you, has helped  your case,' said the counsel. And indeed, he had not been speaking for five  minutes before almost all the ladies had their handkerchiefs in their hands.  The counsel, encouraged by this, addressed the jury in extremely strong  language. Julien shuddered, he felt that he was on the point of bursting into  tears. 'Great God! What will my enemies say?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他们用来对付您的全部夸张手法都是从博须埃那儿剽窃来的，这反而帮了您的忙，”律师说。果然，他还没说上五分钟，几乎所有的女人都拿起了手帕。律师受到鼓舞，对陪审官们说了些极有力的话。于连颤栗了，他觉得眼泪就要夺眶而出。“伟大的天主！我的敌人会说什么呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He was  about to yield to the emotion that was overpowering him,when, fortunately for  himself, he caught an insolent glance from M.Valenod.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他的心马上就要软下来了，幸亏这时候，他无意中看见了德·瓦勒诺男爵先生的傲慢无礼的目光。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  wretch's eyes are ablaze,' he said to himself; 'what a triumph for that vile  nature! Had my crime led to this alone, I should be bound to abhor it. Heaven  knows what he will say of me to Madame de Renal!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个混蛋的眼睛炯炯放光，”他暗想，“这个卑劣的灵魂获得了怎样的胜利啊！如果我的罪行造成了这种结果，我就该诅咒我的罪行。天知道他会对德·莱纳夫人说我些什么！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  thought obliterated all the rest. Shortly afterwards, Julien was recalled to  himself by sounds of approval from the public. His counsel had just concluded  his speech. Julien remembered that it was the correct thing to shake hands with  him. The time had passed quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个念头抹去了其它一切想法。随后，于连被公众赞许的表示唤醒。律师刚刚结束辩护。于连想起了他应该跟律师握握手。时间很快过去了。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Refreshments  were brought to counsel and prisoner. It was only then that Julien was struck  by a curious circumstance: none of the women had left the court for dinner.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>有人给律师和被告送来饮料。于连这时才注意到一个情况：没有一个女人离开座位去吃饭。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Faith,  I am dying of hunger,' said his counsel, 'and you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“说真的，我饿得要死，”律师说，“您呢？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I am  also,' replied Julien.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我也一样，”于连答道。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Look,  there is the Prefect's lady getting her dinner, too,' his counsel said to him,  pointing to the little balcony. 'Cheer up, everything is going well.' The trial  was resumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您看，省长夫人也在那儿吃饭呢，”律师指着小包厢对他说。“鼓起勇气来，一切都很顺利。”审判重又开始。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>As the  President was summing up, midnight struck. He was obliged to pause; amid the  silence of the universal anxiety, the echoing notes of the clock filled the  court.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>庭长作辩论总结时，午夜的钟声响了。庭长不得不暂停，寂静中浮动普遍的焦灼，大时钟的声音在大厅中回荡。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Here  begins the last day of my life,' thought Julien. Presently he felt himself  inflamed by the idea of duty. He had kept his emotion in check until then, and  maintained his determination not to speak; but when the President of the  Assizes asked him if he had anything to say, he rose. He saw in front of him  the eyes of Madame Derville, which, in the lamp light, seemed to shine with a  strange brilliance. 'Can she be crying, by any chance,' he wondered.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的最后一天从此开始，”于连想。很快，他想到了责任，感到周身在燃烧。到此刻为止，他一直挺住不心软，坚持不说话的决心。然而，当庭长问他有没有什么要补充时，他站了起来。他朝前看，看见了德尔维夫人的眼睛，在灯光的映照下，他觉得这双眼睛非常明亮。“莫非她也哭了？”他想。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Gentlemen  of the Jury,'My horror of the contempt which I believed that I could endure at  the moment of my death, impels me to speak. Gentlemen, I have not the honour to  belong to your class, you see in me a peasant who has risen in revolt against  the lowliness of his station.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“各位陪审官先生：我原以为在死亡临近的时刻，我能够无视对我的轻蔑，然而我仍然感到了厌恶，这使我必须说几句话。先生们，我本没有荣幸属于你们那阶级，你们在我身上看到的是一个农民，一个起来反抗他的卑贱命运的农民。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I ask  you for no mercy,' Julien went on, his voice growing stronger. 'I am under no  illusion; death is in store for me; it will be a just punishment. I have been  guilty of attempting the life of the woman most worthy of all respect, of all devotion.  Madame de Renal had been like a mother to me. My crime is atrocious, and it was  premeditated. I have, therefore, deserved death, Gentlemen of the Jury. But,  even were I less-guilty, I see before me men who, without pausing to consider  what pity may be due to my youth, will seek to punish in me and to discourage forever  that class of young men who, born in an inferior station and in a sense  burdened with poverty, have the good fortune to secure a sound education, and  the audacity to mingle with what the pride of rich people calls society.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我对你们不求任何的宽怒，”于连说，口气变得更加坚定有力。“我绝不存在幻想，等待我的是死亡，而死亡对我是公正的。我居然能够谋害最值得尊敬、最值得钦佩的女人的生命。德·莱纳夫人曾经像母亲那样对待我。我的罪行是残忍的，而且是有预谋的。因此我该当被判处死刑，陪审官先生们。但是，即便我的罪不这么严重，我看到有些人也不会因为我年轻值得怜悯而就此止步，他们仍想通过我来惩罚一个阶级的年轻人，永远地让一个阶级的年轻人灰心丧气，因为他们虽然出身于卑贱的阶级，可以说受到贫穷的压迫，却有幸受到良好的教育，敢于侧身在骄傲的有钱人所谓的上流社会之中。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is my crime, Gentlemen, and it will be punished with all the more severity  inasmuch as actually I am not being tried by my peers. I do not see, anywhere  among the jury, a peasant who has grown rich, but only indignant bourgeois… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这就是我的罪行，先生们，事实上，因为我不是受到与我同等的人的审判，它将受到更为严厉的惩罚。我在陪审官的座位上看不到一个富裕起来的农民，我看到的只是一些愤怒的资产者……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>For  twenty minutes Julien continued to speak in this strain; he said everything  that was in his heart; the counsel for the prosecution, who aspired to the  favour of the aristocracy, kept springing from his seat; but in spite of the  somewhat abstract turn which Julien had given the debate,all the women were  dissolved in tears. Madame Derville herself had her handkerchief pressed to her  eyes. Before concluding, Julien returned to the question of premeditation, to  his repentance, to the respect, the filial and unbounded adoration which, in  happier times, he had felt for Madame de Renal … Madame Derville uttered a cry  and fainted.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>二十分钟里，于连一直用这种口气说话；他说出了郁结在心中的一切；代理检察长企盼着贵族的青睐，气得从座位上跳了起来；尽管于连的用语多少有些抽象，所有的女人仍然泪如雨下。就是德维尔夫人也用手帕揩眼睛。在结束之前，于连又回过头来谈他的预谋、他的悔恨、他的尊敬，谈他在那些更为幸福的岁月里对德·莱纳夫人怀有的儿子般的、无限的崇拜……德维尔夫人大叫一声，昏了过去……</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  o'clock struck as the jury retired to their waiting-room. None of the women had  left their seats; several of the men had tears in their eyes.The  general conversation was at first most lively; but gradually, as the jury  delayed their verdict, the feeling of weariness spread a calm over the  assembly. It was a solemn moment; the lamps burned more dimly.Julien,  who was dead tired, heard them discussing round him whether this delay augured  well or ill. He noticed with pleasure that everyone was on his side; the jury  did not return, and still not a woman left the court.</p>
</div>

<p>陪审官退到他们的房间的时候，一点的钟声响了。没有一个女人离开座位，好几个男人眼里噙着泪。交谈开始时很热烈，但是陪审团的决定久候不至，渐渐地，普遍的疲倦使大厅里安静下来。这时刻是庄严的，灯光变得暗淡，于连很累，他听见身边有人在议论时刻不决是好的预兆还是坏的预兆。他高兴地看到大家的心都向着他。陪审团迟迟不回来，但是没有一个女人离开座位。</p>

<p>Just as  two o'clock had struck, a general stir was audible. The little door of the  juryroom opened. M. le Baron de Valenod advanced with a grave, theatrical step,  followed by the rest of the jury. He coughed, then declared that on his soul  and conscience the unanimous opinion of the jury was that Julien Sorel was  guilty of murder, and of murder with premeditation: this verdict inferred a  sentence of death; it was pronounced a moment later. Julien looked at his  watch, and remembered M. de Lavalette; it was a quarter past two. Today is  Friday,' he thought.</p>

<p>两点的钟声刚刚敲过，响起了一片巨大的骚动声。陪审官的房间的小门开了。德·瓦勒诺男爵迈着庄重而戏剧式的步子往前走，后面跟着其他陪审官。他咳嗽了一声。然后宣布说，他以灵魂和良心保证，陪审团一致意见是于连·索莱尔犯有杀人罪，而且是在预谋的杀人罪。这个宣告的结果必然是死刑，过了一会儿，死刑即被宣布。于连看了看他的表，想起了德·拉瓦莱特先生，此时是两点一刻。“今天是礼拜五，”他想。</p>

<p>'Yes,  but this is a lucky day for Valenod, who is sentencing me… I am too closely  guarded for Mathilde to be able to effect my escape, like Madame de Lavalette …  And so, in three days, at this same hour, I shall know what to think of the  great hereafter.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“是的，不过这一天对瓦勒诺这家伙是个好日子，他判了我死刑……我被看得太紧，玛蒂尔德无法像德·拉瓦莱特夫人那样救我……这样，三天以后，同一时刻，我将会知道该如何对待那个伟大的也许了。”</p>

<p>At that  moment, he heard a cry and was recalled to the things of this world. The women  round him were sobbing; he saw that every face was turned towards a little  gallery concealed by the capital of a gothic pilaster. He learned afterwards  that Mathilde had been hidden there. As the cry was not repeated, everyone  turned back to look at Julien, for whom the gendarmes were trying to clear a  passage through the crowd.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这时，他听见一声喊叫，被唤回到现实世界中来。他周围的女人哭哭啼啼，他看见所有的脸都转向一个开在哥特式墙柱顶饰上的小旁听席。他后来知道玛蒂尔德藏在里面。叫了一声就不叫了，人们又转过脸看于连，警察费力地拥着他穿过人群。</p>

<p>'Let us  try not to give that rascal Valenod any food for laughter,' thought Julien.  'With what a contrite and coaxing air he uttered the verdict that involved the  death penalty! Whereas that poor president, even though he has been a judge for  all these years, had tears in his eyes when he sentenced me. What a joy for  Valenod to have his revenge for our old rivalry for Madame de Renal! And so I  shall never see her any more! It is all finished… A last farewell is impossible  between us, I feel it… How happy I should have been to express to her all the  horror I feel for my crime!</p>

<p>“让我们尽量别让瓦勒诺这骗子笑话，”于连想。“他宣布导致死刑的声明时的表情是多么尴尬和虚假啊！而那个可怜的庭长，虽然当了多年法官，在宣判我死刑时眼里却含着泪。瓦勒诺那家伙多高兴啊，他终于报了我们旧时在德·莱纳夫人身边的竞争之仇！……我见不到她了！完了……我感觉到了，我们最后的告别已不可能……要是我能把我对我的罪行有多么厌恶告诉她，我该多么幸福啊！”</p>
