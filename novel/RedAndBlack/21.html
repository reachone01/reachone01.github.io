  <div class="left"><p>It  was with a childish pleasure that Julien spent an hour in pasting words  together. As he left his room he came upon his pupils and their mother; she  took the letter with a simplicity and courage, the calmness of which terrified  him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>于连快乐得像个孩子，把那些词凑在一起，整整用了一个钟头。他走出房间，正碰上他的学生和他们的母亲；她自然而勇敢地接过信，其镇静令于连害怕。</p>

<p>'Is  the gum quite dry?' she asked him.</p>

<p>“胶干了吗？”她问。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Can  this be the woman who was being driven mad by remorse?' he thought. 'What are  her plans at this moment?' He was too proud to ask her; but never, perhaps, had  she appealed to him more strongly.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这就是那个被悔恨搞得疯疯癫癫的女人吗？”他想。“她此刻有什么打算？”他太骄傲了，不屑于问她；然而，也许她从未像现在这样  讨他喜欢。</p>

<p>'If  things go amiss,' she went on with the same coolness, 'I shall be stripped of  everything. Bury this store somewhere in the mountains; it may some day be my  last resource.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这件事搞得不好，”她补充说，神情依旧那么冷静，“我就一无所有了。把这点积蓄埋在山上什么地方吧，说不定有朝一日这就是我唯一的指靠了。”</p>

<p>From  the moment of his opening the anonymous letter, M. de Renal's life had been a  burden to him. He had not been so agitated since a duel that he had nearly had  to fight in 1816, and, to do him justice, the prospect of receiving a bullet in  his person would now have distressed him ess. He examined the letter from every  angle. 'Is not this a woman's hand?' he asked himself. 'In that case, what  woman can have written it?'He  considered in turn all the women he knew at Verrieres, without finding a  definite object for his suspicions. Could a man have dictated the letter? If  so, what man? Here again, a similar uncertainty; he had earned the jealousy and  no doubt the hatred of the majority of the men he knew. 'I must consult my  wife,' he said to himself, from force of habit, as he rose from the armchair in  which he had collapsed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>从打开匿名信那一刻起，德·莱纳先生的日子就变得不堪忍受了。他从来没有这样激动过，还是在一八一六年，他差一点与人决斗，说句  公道话，他就是挨一抢也比现在好受些。他翻过来掉过去地察看那封信，心想：“这不是女人的笔迹吗？如果是，那会是哪个女人写的呢？”他把他在维里埃认识的女人—个个过了—遍，始终不能把疑心落在哪一个的头上。“也许是个男人口授了这封信？那是谁呢？”同样不能肯定；他认识的人大部分都嫉妒他，也许还恨他。“应该问问我妻子，”这是他的习惯，他一边想着，一边从深陷其中的椅子上站起来。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p> No sooner had he risen than 'Good God!' he exclaimed,  clapping his hand to his head, 'she is the one person whom I cannot trust; from  this moment she is my enemy.' And tears of anger welled into his eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他刚站直，“伟大的天主啊！他拍着脑袋说，“我首先要提防的就是她呀，她现在是我的敌人了。”他不由得大怒，眼泪都涌上来了。</p>



</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>It  was a fitting reward for that barrenness of heart in which practical wisdom in  the provinces is rooted, that the two men whom, at that moment, M. de Renal  most dreaded were his two most intimate friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>心肠硬构成了外省全部的人生智慧，由于一种恰如其分的补偿，此刻德·莱纳先生最怕的两个人正是他的两个最亲密的朋友。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Apart  from them, I have ten friends perhaps,' and he turned them over in his mind,  calculating the exact amount of comfort that he would be able to derive from  each. 'To all of them, to all of them,' he cried in his rage, 'my appalling  misfortune will give the most intense pleasure.' Happily for him, he supposed  himself to be greatly envied, and not without reason. Apart from his superb  house in town on which the King of ——had just conferred everlasting honour by  sleeping beneath its roof, he had made an admirable piece of work of his  country house at Vergy. The front was painted white, and the windows adorned  with handsome green shutters. He was comforted for a moment by the thought of  this magnificence. The fact of the matter was that this mansion was visible  from a distance of three or four leagues, to the great detriment of all the  country houses or socalled chateaux of the neighbourhood, which had been  allowed to retain the humble grey tones imparted to them by time.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“除了他们，我大概还有十个朋友，”他一个个地数了一遍，依次估计能从他们那里得到多少安慰。“所有这些人！所有这些人！”他发  狂地喊道，“都会从我这可怕遭遇中得到最大的快乐啊！”幸亏他觉得自己很受人嫉妒，这并非没有道理。他有全城最豪华的房子，最近更因国王在那里过夜而荣耀无比。此外，他在韦尔吉的别墅也修葺得很体面，正面刷成白色，窗户都装上了绿色的护窗板，很漂亮。想到别墅的豪华。他得到片刻的慰藉。的确，这座别墅三、四法里之外就能看见，周围那些乡下宅邸或所谓的别墅都任凭岁月侵蚀，—派灰暗寒酸的样子。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>M.  de Renal could reckon upon the tears and pity of one of his friends, the  churchwarden of the parish; but he was an imbecile who shed tears at  everything. This man was nevertheless his sole resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生可以指望一个朋友的眼泪和同情，此人是本堂区财务管理委员，可这是个动不动就哭的笨蛋。然而此君正是他唯一的依靠。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  misfortune is comparable to mine?' he exclaimed angrily. 'What isolation!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么样的不幸能与我的不幸相比！”他愤怒地喊道，“多么孤立啊：”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Is  it possible,' this truly pitiable man asked himself, 'is it possible that, in  my distress, I have not a single friend of whom to ask advice? For my mind is  becoming unhinged, I can feel it! Ah, Falcoz! Ah, Ducros!' he cried bitterly.  These were the names of two of his boyhood's friends whom he had alienated by  his arrogance in 1814. They were not noble, and he had tried to alter the terms  of equality on which they had been living all their lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这可能吗！”这个人真可怜，自语道，“这可能吗，在我倒霉的时候竟连一个可以讨个主意的朋友也没有？我的理智混乱了，我感觉到  了！啊！法尔考兹！啊！杜克罗斯，”他喊道，不胜酸楚，“这是两个儿时的朋友的名字，他在一八一四年飞黄腾达以后疏远了他们。他们不是贵族，他就想改变自童年起一直存在于他们之间的那种平等的气氛。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>One  of them, Falcoz, a man of spirit and heart, a paper merchant at Verrieres, had  purchased a printing press in the chief town of the Department and had started  a newspaper. The Congregation had determined to ruin him: his paper had been  condemned, his printer's licence had been taken from him. In these unfortunate  circumstances he ventured to write to M. de Renal for the first time in ten  years. The Mayor of Verrieres felt it incumbent on him to reply in the Ancient  Roman style: 'If the King's Minister did me the honour to consult me, I should  say to him: &quot;Ruin without compunction all provincial printers, and make  printing a monopoly like the sale of tobacco.&quot;' This letter to an intimate  friend which had set the whole of Verrieres marvelling at the time, M. de Renal  now recalled, word for word, with horror. 'Who would have said that with my  rank, my fortune, my Crosses, I should one day regret it?' It was in such  transports of anger, now against himself, now against all around him, that he  passed a night of anguish; but, fortunately, it did not occur to him to spy  upon his wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>两个人中，法尔考兹是个既有才智又有勇气的人，在维里埃做纸张生意，曾经从省城买来印刷机，办了一份报纸。圣会决心让他破产，于是报纸被查封，印刷许可被吊销。在这种哀苦无告的情况下，他十年来第一次试着给德·莱纳先生写了一封信。维里埃市长认为应该像古罗马人那样回答他：“倘蒙国王的大臣屈尊垂询，我将对他说：‘让外省所有印刷厂主破产，无须怜悯，让国家垄断印刷业，如烟草专卖一样。’”这封给一位亲密朋友的信，当时博得维里埃全城的赞赏，德·莱纳先生还记得那里面的字句，想起来真让他胆战心惊。“以我当时的地位，财产和荣誉，谁料想我有一天会后悔写这封信呢？”在这种一会儿对自己一会儿对别人的狂怒中，他度过了一个可怕的夜晚，他竟没有想到侦察一下妻子，真是万幸。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  am used to Louise,' he said to himself, 'she knows all my affairs; were I free  to marry again tomorrow I could find no one fit to take her place.' Next, he  sought relief in the idea that his wife was innocent; this point of view made  it unnecessary for him to show his strength of character, and was far more  convenient; how many slandered wives have we not all seen!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我习惯了路易丝，”他心里说，“我的事她都知道；假使我明天能再结婚，我还找不到能顶替她的人呢。”于是，他想到他的妻子是清白的。不禁得意起来；这种看法使他觉得不必大动肝火，他因此平静多了；“有多少女人遭人诬陷啊！”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  what!' he suddenly exclaimed, pacing the floor with a convulsive step, 'am I to  allow her, as though I were a man of straw, a mere ragamuffin, to make a mock  of me with her lover? Is the whole of Verrieres to be allowed to sneer at my  complacency? What have they not said about Charmier?' (a notorious local  cuckold). 'When he is mentioned, is there not a smile on every face? He is a  good pleader, who is there that ever mentions his talent for public speaking?  &quot;Ah! Charmier!&quot; is what they say; &quot;Bernard's Charmier.&quot;  They actually give him the name of the man that has disgraced him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“什么！”他突然喊了起来，脚步抽搐地走了几步，“我能像无耻之徒、像叫花子那样容忍她和她的情夫取笑我吗？难道应该让维里埃全城对我的懦弱议论纷纷吗？人们对夏米埃（这是当地一个尽人皆知的受骗丈夫）什么话没有说过啊？一提到他的名字，谁的嘴上不带着笑？他是个好律师，可谁说过他的口才？啊！夏米埃！那个夏米埃·德·贝尔纳，人们就是这样用一个蒙受耻辱的人的名字来称呼他。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Thank  heaven,' said M. de Renal at other moments, 'I have no daughter, and the manner  in which I am going to punish their mother will not damage the careers of my  children; I can surprise that young peasant with my wife, and kill the pair of  them; in that event, the tragic outcome of my misfortune may perhaps make it  less absurd.' This idea appealed to him: he worked it out in the fullest  detail. 'The Penal Code is on my side, and, whatever happens, our Congregation  and my friends on the jury will save me.' He examined his hunting knife, which  had a keen blade; but the thought of bloodshed frightened him.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“感谢上天”，德·莱纳先生有时又说，“我没有女儿，我要惩罚这位母亲的方式丝毫不会妨害我的儿子们的前程；我可以当场捉住那个小乡下佬和我的妻子，把两个人统统杀死；这样的话，事情的悲惨也许会消除事情的可笑。”这个念头很是称心，他便想到种种的细节。“刑法在我一边，无论发生什么事，我们的圣会和我的陪审团里的朋友们总是会营救我的。”他检查了猎刀，很锋利；然而，一想到血，他害怕了。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  might thrash this insolent tutor black and blue and turn him from the house;  but what a stir in Verrieres and, indeed, throughout the Department! After the  suppression of Falcoz's paper, when his editor came out of prison, I was  instrumental in making him lose a place worth six hundred francs. They say that  the scribbler has dared to show his face again in Besancon, he may easily  attack me, and so cunningly that it will be impossible to bring him to justice!  That insolent fellow will insinuate in a thousand ways that he has been  speaking the truth. A man of family, who respects his rank as I do, is always  hated by plebeians. I shall see myself in those frightful Paris papers; my God!  what degradation! To see the ancient name of Renal plunged in the mire of  ridicule… If I ever travel, I shall have to change my name; what! give up this  name which is my pride and my strength. What a crowning infamy!</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“我可以把这个无礼的教师痛打一顿，然后赶走；可这会在维里埃甚至在省里引起多大的哄动啊！法尔考兹的报纸被判关闭之后，那主编出狱时，我曾插手让他失去了薪水六百法郎的工作。据说这个蹩脚文人又敢在贝藏松露面了，他可以巧妙地攻击我，并且使我无法把他拖上法庭。把他拖上法庭！……这个无礼之徒会千方百计地暗示他说的是真话。一个像我这样出身高贵又有地位的人总是受到所有平民的忌恨。我会看到我的名字出现在巴黎那些可怕的报纸上；啊，我的天主！怎样的深渊啊！看见莱纳这古老的姓氏跌进笑料的泥潭……如果出门旅行，我就得改名换性；什么！放弃这个使我得到荣誉和力量的姓氏！真是灾上加灾啊！</p>



</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'If  I do not kill my wife, if I drive her from the house with ignominy, she has her  aunt at Besancon, who will hand over the whole of her fortune to her on the  quiet. My wife will go and live in Paris with Julien; Verrieres will hear of  it, and I shall again be regarded as a dupe.' This unhappy man then perceived,  from the failing light of his lamp, that day was beginning to break. He went to  seek a breath of air in the garden. At that moment, he had almost made up his  mind to create no scene, chiefly because a scene of that sort would fill his  good friends at Verrieres with joy.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“如果我不杀死我的妻子，只把她羞辱一番赶出家门，她在贝藏松的姑妈会把全部财产不经任何手续地直接交给她。我妻子会去巴黎和于连生活在一起；维里埃的人会知道，我还是会被当作一个受骗的丈夫。”灯光暗淡，这个不幸的人发现天开始亮了，他到院子里呼吸点新鲜空气，这时，他差不多已经决定不惊动任何人，因为他想到倘使事情张扬出去，会使维里埃他的那些好朋友们心花怒放的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>His  stroll in the garden calmed him somewhat. 'No,' he cried, 'I shall certainly  not part with my wife, she is too useful to me.' He pictured to himself with  horror what his house would be like without his wife; his sole female relative  was the Marquise de R—— who was old, idiotic and evil-minded.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在院子里散散步，他略微平静了些。“不，”他喊道，“我不能没有我的妻子，她对我太有用了。”他想象他的家一旦没有了妻子会是什么佯子，感到很可怕；他除了Ｒ侯爵夫人没有别的亲戚，可是她又老又蠢又恶毒。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>An  idea of the greatest good sense occurred to him, but to put it into practice  required a strength of character far exceeding the little that the poor man  possessed. 'If I keep my wife,' he said to himself; 'I know my own nature; one  day, when she taxes my patience, I shall reproach her with her offence. She is  proud, we are bound to quarrel, and all this will happen before she has  inherited her aunt's estate. And then, how they will all laugh at me! My wife  loves her children, it will all come to them in the end. But I, I shall be the  talk of Verrieres. What, they will say, he couldn't even punish his wife! Would  it not be better to stick to my suspicions and to verify nothing? Then I tie my  own hands, I cannot afterwards reproach her with anything.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他有了一个意义重大的主意，然而其实现所要求的性格力量远非这可怜的人所能有。“假使我留下妻子，”他心想，“有一天她让我忍无可忍的时候，我就会指责她的过失，我肯定会这样做的。她很骄傲，我们就会闹翻，而这一切发生的时候她还没有继承她姑妈的遗产。这时候，看人们怎么嘲笑我吧！我妻子爱她的孩子，到头来一切都会落到他们手上。而我呢，我将成为维里埃的大笑柄。他们会说：‘什么，他竟不知道如何报复他老婆！’我是不是疑而不察反而更好些？可这样我就自缚手脚，什么也不能指责她了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>A  moment later M. de Renal, his wounded vanity once more gaining the mastery, was  laboriously recalling all the stories told in the billiard room of the Casino  or Noble Club of Verrieres, when some fluent talker interrupted the pool to  make merry at the expense of some cuckolded husband. How cruel, at that moment,  those pleasantries seemed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>过了一会，德·菜纳先生那被伤害的虚荣心义上来了，他费力地回想在维里埃的“俱乐部”或“贵族圈”的台球厅里，某个能说会道的家伙如何停下赌局使用种种方式拿一个受骗丈夫来开心。此时此刻，他觉得那些玩笑何其残酷啊！</p>

</div></div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'God!  Why is not my wife dead! Then I should be immune from ridicule. Why am I not a  widower! I should go and spend six months in Paris in the best society.' After  this momentary happiness caused by the idea of widowhood, his imagination returned  to the methods of ascertaining the truth. Should he at midnight, after the  whole household had gone to bed, sprinkle a few handfuls of brain outside the  door of Julien's room? Next morning, at daybreak, he would see the footprints  on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“天主！我的妻子怎么不死呢！那样我就不会遭人耻笑了。我怎么不成个鳏夫呢！那样我就会去巴黎，在最高贵的圈子里过上六个月。”鳏居的念头给了他片刻的欢乐，随后他又想如何察明真相了。“是不是半夜众人都睡着的时候，在于连的房门前撒一层薄薄的麸皮？第二天早晨天亮时，便可看见脚印。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'But  that would be no good,' he broke out angrily, 'that wretched Elisa would notice  it, and it would be all over the house at once that I am jealous.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“可是这办法根本不行！”他突然疯狂地喊道，“爱丽莎那个坏女人会看出来的，这座房子里的人立刻就会知道我嫉妒了。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>In  another story that circulated at the Casino, a husband had made certain of his  plight by fastening a hair with a little wax so as to seal up the doors of his  wife's room and her lover's.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在“俱乐部”，还讲过一个故事：一个十丈夫用一点点蜡把一根头发像封条一样粘在老婆的门上和风流客的门上，结果确信他倒了霉。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>After  so many hours of vacillation, this method of obtaining enlightenment seemed to  him decidedly the best, and he was thinking of adopting it, when at a bend in  the path he came upon that wife whom he would have liked to see dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>经过这么长时间的犹豫不决，他觉得这个使他的命运得以明确的办法肯定是最好的，他考虑采用，这时，在小路的拐弯处他碰见了他希望  看见她死的那个女人。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  was returning from the village. She had gone to hear mass in the church of  Vergy. A tradition of extremely doubtful value in the eyes of the cold  philosopher, but one in which she believed, made out that the little church now  in use had been the chapel of the castle of the Lord of Vergy. This thought  obsessed Madame de Renal throughout the time which she had meant to pass in  prayer in this church. She kept on picturing to herself her husband killing  Julien during the chase, as though by accident, and afterwards, that evening,  making her eat his heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>她从村里回来。她到韦尔吉的教堂里望弥撒。根据一个在冷静的哲学家看来极不确实而她却信以为真的传说，今日人们使用的这座教堂就是当年韦尔吉领主城堡里的小教堂。德·莱纳夫人打算去这个教堂祈祷时，这个念头一直纠缠着她。她不断地想象她丈夫趁打猎时仿佛失手杀死于连，然后晚上让她吃他的心。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'My  fate,' she said to herself, 'depends on what he will think when he hears me.  After these terrible moments, perhaps I shall not find another opportunity to  speak to him. He is not a wise creature, swayed by reason. I might, if he were,  with the aid of my own feeble wits, forecast what he would do or say. But my  fate lies in my cunning, in the art of directing the thoughts of this whimsical  creature, who becomes blind with anger and incapable of seeing things. Great  God! I require talent, coolness, where am I to find them?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我的命运，”她自语道，“取决于他听我说了以后有什么打算。也许在这要命的一刻钟之后，我就没有机会跟他说话了。他不是一个明智的通情达理的人。我可以凭借我这点理性预料到他将做什么或者说什么。他将决定我们共同的命运，他有这个权力。不过这命运也还取决于我的巧妙和如何引导这个反复无常的人的思想，愤怒已使他盲目，看不见事情的另一半。伟大的天主！我需要才智，需要冷静，可我到哪儿去找？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  recovered her calm as though by magic on entering the garden and seeing her  husband in the distance. The disorder of his hair and clothes showed that he  had not slept. <p>She handed him a letter which, though the seal was broken, was  still folded. He, without opening it, gazed at his wife with madness in his  eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她走进花园，远远地看见了丈夫，竟神奇地恢复了平静。他头发散乱，衣履不整，一看就知道一夜未眠。</p>
<p>她把一封打开然而折起的信递给他。他并不展信阅读，只是两眼发狂地盯着她。</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Here  is an abomination,' she said to him, 'which an evil-looking man who claims to  know you and that you owe him a debt of gratitude, handed to me as I came past  the back of the lawyer's garden. One thing I must ask of you, and that is that  you send back to his own people, and without delay, that Monsieur Julien.'  Madame de Renal made haste to utter this name, even beginning a little too soon  perhaps, in order to rid herself of the fearful prospect of having to utter it.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>“这封信真可恶，”她说，“我从公证人的花园后面经过时，一个面目可憎的人交给我的，他说他认识您，受过您的恩惠。我要求您一件  事，立刻把这位于连先生打发回家。”德·莱纳夫人赶紧说出这句话，如释重负，也许说得早了些，可她不能不说，尽管她很害怕。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  was filled with joy on beholding the joy that it gave her husband. From the  fixed stare which he directed at her she realised that Julien had guessed  alright. Instead of worrying about a very present trouble, 'what intelligence,'  she thought to herself. 'What perfect tact! And in a young man still quite  devoid of experience! To what heights will he not rise in time? Alas! Then his  success will make him forget me.'</p>

<p>她看见丈夫的反应，不由得大喜。从他盯住她看的目光中，她知道于连所料不差。“遇到这桩实实在在的不幸而不感到悲痛，这需要怎样的天才啊，”她想，“需要怎样完美的分寸感啊！可他还不过是个毫无经验的年轻人啊！日后他什么事情做不到呢？唉！那时候成功会使他忘了我。”</p>

<p>This  little act of admiration of the man she adored completely restored her  composure.</p>

<p>She congratulated herself on the step she had taken. 'I have proved  myself not unworthy of Julien,' she said to herself, with a sweet and secret  relish.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>对她所崇拜的人的这点钦佩，使她完全摆脱了慌乱。</p>

<p>她对自己的行动也颇为自得，“我没有给于连丢脸，”她想，心中充满温柔而隐秘的快乐。</p>

</div></div>

<p>Without  saying a word, for fear of committing himself, M. de Renal examined this second  anonymous letter composed, as the reader may remember, of printed words gummed  upon a sheet of paper of a bluish tinge. 'They are making a fool of me in every  way,' M. de Renal said to himself, utterly worn out.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳先生害怕表态，一声不吭，仔细察看这第二封匿名信，如果读者还记得的话，这封信是用一些印好的字粘在一张浅蓝色的纸上的  。“大家用各种办法嘲弄我，”德·莱纳先生心想，顿时感到心力交瘁。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Fresh  insults to be looked into, and all owing to my wife!' He was on the point of  deluging her with a stream of the coarsest invective; the thought of the  fortune awaiting her at Besancon just stopped him. Overpowered by the necessity  of venting his anger on something, he tore up the sheet on which this second  anonymous letter was gummed, and strode rapidly away, feeling that he could not  endure his wife's company. A minute later, he returned to her, already more  calm.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“又是一番污辱需要查明，而且还是因为我妻子！”他正要用最粗鲁的语言辱骂他的妻子，想到贝藏松的遗产又勉强止住。他必须找点什么事发泄一番，就把那封信揉成一团，大步走开了，他需要离他的妻子远一些。过了一会儿，他回到她身旁，比刚才平静了些。</p></div>
</div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'We  must take action at once and dismiss Julien,' she immediately began; 'after all  he is only the son of a working man. You can compensate him with a few crowns,  besides, he is clever and can easily find another place, with M. Valenod, for  instance, or the Sub-Prefect Maugiron; they both have families. And so you will  not be doing him any harm… '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“要拿定主意，把于连打发走，”她立刻对他说，“说到底他不过是个工人的儿子罢了。给他几个埃居赔偿损失，再说他有学问，找地方很容易，例如到瓦勒诺先生或德·莫吉隆专区区长家里，他们都有孩子。这样您也没有让他蒙受损失……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  speak like the fool that you are,' cried M. de Renal in a voice of thunder.  'How can one expect common sense of a woman? You never pay attention to what is  reasonable; how should you have any knowledge? Your carelessness, your laziness  leave you just enough activity to chase butterflies, feeble creatures which we  are so unfortunate as to have in our households … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您这样说真蠢！”德·莱纳先生喊道，声音很吓人。“还能指望女人有什么理智吗？您从来不留心什么合理什么不合理；您如何才能明白点事儿呢？您的随便，您的懒惰，就是在扑蝴蝶上使劲，软弱的人啊，我们家有这样的人真是不幸！……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal let him speak, and he spoke at length; he passed his anger, as they  say in those parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人由他说去，他说了很久；他出了气，这是当地人的说法。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Sir,'  she answered him finally, 'I speak as a woman whose honour, that is to say her  most priceless possession, has been outraged.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“先生，”她终于回答道，“我以一个名誉受到凌辱的女人的身份说话，也就是说，她最宝贵的东西受到了凌辱。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal preserved an unalterable calm throughout the whole of this trying  conversation, upon which depended the possibility of her continuing to live  beneath the same roof as Julien. She sought out the ideas that seemed to her  best fitted to guide her husband's blind anger. She had remained unmoved by all  the insulting remarks that he had addressed to her, she did not hear them, she  was thinking all the time of Julien. 'Will he be pleased with me?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>在这场痛苦的谈话中，德·莱纳夫人始终保持冷静，这场谈话将决定她能否和于连继续在一个屋顶下生活。为了引导她丈夫的盲目怒火，  她寻找着她认为最合适的种种看法。她丈夫骂她，可她无动于衷，充耳不闻，一心只想着于连。“他会对我满意吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  little peasant upon whom we have lavished every attention, including presents,  may be innocent,' she said at length, 'but he is none the less the occasion of  the first insult I have ever received … Sir, when I read that abominable  document, I vowed that either he or I should leave your roof.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我们对这小乡下佬关怀备至，甚至送他礼物，他也许是无辜的，”她终开说道，“可是毕竟因为他我才生平第一次受到侮辱……先生！当我看到这封可恶的信时，我发誓不是他就是我要离开您的家。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Do  you wish to create a scandal that will dishonour me and yourself as well?  You'll be giving a fine treat to many people in Verrieres.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您想闹出事来让我也让您丢脸吗？您这是吊维里埃的许多人的胃口啊。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  is true; they are all jealous of the state of prosperity to which your wise  management has brought you, your family and the town… Very well, I shall go and  bid Julien ask you for leave to spend a month with that timber merchant in the  mountain, a fit companion for that little workman.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这倒是真的，人人都嫉妒，您的明智的管理使您、您的家庭、城市都兴旺发达……那好吧，我去让于连向您请假，到山里那个木材商家  里住上一个月，他是这个小工人的好朋友。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Take  care what you do,' put in M. de Renal, calmly enough. 'The one thing I must  insist on is that you do not speak to him. You would show temper and make him  cross with me; you know how touchy the little gentleman is.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“别忙着行动，”德·莱纳先生相当平静地说，“我首先要求的，是您别和他说话。您会激怒他，使我跟他闹翻，您知道这位小先生多么敏感。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  young man has no tact,' went on Madame de Renal; 'he may be learned, you know  about that, but at bottom he is nothing but a peasant.For  my own part, I have never had any opinion of him since he refused to marry Elisa,  it was a fortune ready made; and all because now and again she pays a secret  visit to M. Valenod.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这个年轻人一点儿也不机灵，”德·莱纳夫人说，“他可能有学问，这您是清楚的，但说到底这不过是个地地道道的乡下人。至于我，自从他拒绝娶爱丽莎，我对他就再没有好印象了，那可是一笔稳稳当当的财产啊，他竟借口她有几次秘密地拜访瓦勒诺先生。”</p>

</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!'  said M. de Renal, raising his eyebrows as far as they would go, 'what, did  Julien tell you that?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“噢！”德·莱纳先生说，眉毛高高地一耸，“什么，于连跟您说的？”</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'No,  not exactly; he has always spoken to me of the vocation that is calling him to  the sacred ministry; but believe me, the first vocation for the lower orders is  to find their daily bread. He made it fairly clear to me that he was not  unaware of these secret visits.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“不完全是，他常向我说起他献身宗教事业的志向；但是依我看，对这些普通人来说，第一个志向是有饭吃。他没有明说，可我听出来他  不是不知道这些秘密的来往。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'And  I, I, knew nothing about them!' cried M. de Renal, all his fury returning,  emphasising every word. 'There are things going on in my house of which I know  nothing… What! There has been something between Elisa and Valenod?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“而我，我，我竟不知道！”德·莱纳先生火又上来了，一字一顿地说。“在我家里居然有我不知道的事情……怎么！在爱丽莎和瓦勒诺之间有什么事吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Oh,  that's an old story, my dear friend,' Madame de Renal said laughing, 'and I  daresay no harm was done. It was in the days when your good friend Valenod  would not have been sorry to have it thought in Verrieres that there was a  little love—of a purely platonic sort—exchanged between him and me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“嘿！这可是一段老故事了，亲爱的朋友，”德·菜纳夫人笑着说，“也许并没有什么不好的事。那个时候，您的好朋友瓦勒诺大概正希望维里埃的人认为他和我之间有一种完全柏拉图式的小小爱情。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  had that idea at one time,' cried M. de Renal striking his head in his fury as  he advanced from one discovery to another, 'and you never said a word to me  about it?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我有一次也这样想过，”德·莱纳先生叫道，一边拍着脑袋，越想越有所发现，“可您怎么一点儿也没跟我谈起？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Was  I to make trouble between two friends all for a little outburst of vanity on  the part of our dear Governor? What woman is there in society to whom he has  not addressed one or more letters, extremely witty and even a trifle gallant?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“为了我们亲爱的所长的一点点虚荣心，就应该让两个朋友伤了和气吗？对哪个上流社会的女人，他没有写过几封极其风雅甚至有些风流  的信呢？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Has  he written to you?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他也给您写了吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  writes frequently.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“写了很多。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Show  me his letters this instant, I order you'; and M. de Renal added six feet to  his stature.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“立刻把这些信拿给我看，我命令；”德·莱纳先生一下子长高了六尺。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  shall do nothing of the sort,' the answer came in a tone so gentle as to be  almost indifferent, 'I shall let you see them some other day, when you are more  yourself.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“现在可不行，”她回答他，那一分温柔简直快要变成撒娇了，“哪一天您更有理智了，我再给您看。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'This  very instant, damn it!' cried M. de Renal, blind with rage, and yet happier  than he had been at any time in the last twelve hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我现在就看，见鬼！”德·莱纳先生怒气冲冲地嚷道，不过，十二个钟头以来，他还从未这样高兴过。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Will  you swear to me,' said Madame de Renal solemnly, 'never to quarrel with the  Governor of the Poorhouse over these letters?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您向我发誓，”德·莱纳夫人严肃地说，“永远不因这些信和收容所所长吵架。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Quarrel  or no quarrel, I can take the foundlings away from him; but,' he continued,  furiously, 'I want those letters this instant; where are they?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“吵也好不吵也好，我总可以不让他管理那些弃儿；但是，”他生气地继续说道，“我现在就要那些信，在哪儿？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'In  a drawer in my desk; but you may be certain, I shall not give you the key of  it.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“在我的桌子的抽屉里，但我肯定不会给您钥匙的。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  shall be able to force it,' he cried as he made off in the direction of his  wife's room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我会砸开，”他一边嚷一边朝他妻子的房间跑去。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>He  did indeed break open with an iron bar a valuable mahogany writing desk,  imported from Paris, which he used often to polish with the tail of his coat  when he thought he detected a spot on its surface.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>他果然用一把凿子把那张有轮纹的桃花心木宝贵写字台弄坏了，桌子是从巴黎买来的，平时他若认为上面有什么污迹，常常用衣襟擦拭。</p>
</div></div>





<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal meanwhile had run up the hundred and twenty steps of the dovecote; she  knotted the corner of a white handkerchief to one of the iron bars of the  little window. She was the happiest of women.</p>
<p>With  tears in her eyes she gazed out at the wooded slopes of the mountain.  'Doubtless,' she said to herself, 'beneath one of those spreading beeches,  Julien is watching for this glad signal.' For long she strained her ears, then  cursed the monotonous drone of the grasshoppers and the twitter of the birds.  But for those tiresome sounds, a cry of joy, issuing from among the rocks,  might have reached her in her tower. Her ravening gaze devoured that immense  slope of dusky verdure, unbroken as the surface of a meadow, that was formed by  the treetops. 'How is it he has not the sense,' she asked herself with deep  emotion, 'to think of some signal to tell me that his happiness is no less than  mine?' She came down from the dovecote only when she began to be afraid that  her husband might come up in search of her.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>德·莱纳夫人爬了一百二十级阶梯，一气跑上鸽楼；她把手帕的一角系在小窗户的一根铁栏杆上。此刻，她是世界上最幸福的女人。<p>她朝  山上的那片森林望去，眼里充满了泪水。“肯定，”她心中说，“在一棵茂盛的山毛榉树下，于连正等待着这幸福的信号。”她久久地侧耳倾听，咒骂单调的蝉鸣和鸟雀的啁啾，没有这讨厌的声音，肯定会有一阵快乐的欢呼从大岩石那边一直传到这里来。她贪婪地望着，恨不得一眼望尽这片暗绿色的、像草地般平坦的、由树梢构成的斜坡。“他怎么这么死心眼，”她想，万种柔情涌上心头，“怎么没想到给我—个信号，告诉我他和我一样地高兴呢？”只是因为害怕她丈夫会来找，她才下了鸽楼。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>She  found him foaming with rage. He was running through M. Valenod's anodyne  sentences, that were little used to being read with such emotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>她看见他怒不可遏。他正浏览瓦勒诺先生的那些无伤大雅的词句呢，这原是不适于带着这样的激动来阅读的。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Seizing  a moment in which a lull in her husband's exclamations gave her a chance to make  herself heard:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>突然，她丈夫惊呼起来，她趁机说道：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  cannot get away from my original idea,' said Madame de Renal, 'Julien ought to  go for a holiday. Whatever talent he may have for Latin, he is nothing more,  after all, than a peasant who is often coarse and wanting in tact; every day, thinking  he is being polite, he plies me with extravagant compliments in the worst of  taste, which he learns by heart from some novel … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我还是那个想法，”德·莱纳夫人说，“最好让于连去旅行。无论他在拉丁文上多么有才能，他毕竟是个农民，经常是粗鲁的，缺少分  寸。他每天都对我说一些夸张的、俗不可耐的恭维话，还以为是彬彬有礼呢，那都是从什么小说里看来记熟的……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'He  never reads any,' cried M. de Renal; 'I am positive as to that. Do you suppose  that I am a blind master who knows nothing of what goes on under his roof?'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他从来不读小说，”德·莱纳先生吼道，“我可以保证。您以为我是个瞎了眼的家长不知道家里发生的事吗？”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Very  well, if he doesn't read those absurd compliments anywhere, he invents them,  which is even worse. He will have spoken of me in that tone in Verrieres; and,  without going so far,' said Madame de Renal, with the air of one making a  discovery, 'he will have spoken like that before Elisa, which is just as though  he had spoken to M. Valenod.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“就算是吧！如果他不是在什么地方读过这些可笑的恭维话，那就是他自已编的，那样更糟。说不定他在维里埃就是用这样的口吻谈论我  的；再说，不用走得更远，”德·莱纳夫人说，那神气就像有了什么新发现，“他也许已经在爱丽莎面前这样说过我，这差不多就跟在瓦勒诺先生面前说我一样。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Ah!'  cried M. de Renal, making the table and the whole room shake with one of the  stoutest blows that human fist ever gave, 'the anonymous letter in print and  Valenod's letters were all on the same paper.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“啊！”德·莱纳先生叫道，从未有过的一记重拳砸下来，桌子与房间都震动了。“那封印刷的匿名信和瓦勒诺先生的信用的是同一种纸。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'At  last!' thought Madame de Renal; she appeared thunderstruck by this discovery,  and without having the courage to add a single word went and sat down on the  divan, at the farther end of the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

</div>
<p>“总算行啦！……”德·莱纳夫人想；她装作被这一发现惊呆了，不敢多说一句话，远远地退到客厅尽头，在一张沙发上坐下。</p>
</div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>The  battle was now won; she had her work cut out to prevent M. de Renal from going  and talking to the supposed author of the anonymous letter.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这一仗已经打赢，她还要下大力气阻止德·莱纳先生去找匿名信的假定作者算帐。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'How  is it you do not feel that to make a scene, without sufficient proof, with M. Valenod  would be the most deplorable error? If you are envied, Sir, who is to blame?  Your own talents: your wise administration, the buildings you have erected with  such good taste, the dowry I brought you, and above all the considerable  fortune we may expect to inherit from my worthy aunt, a fortune the extent of  which is vastly exaggerated, have made you the principal person in Verrieres.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您怎么没有想到，没有足够的证据就去找瓦勒诺先生大吵一通，这是最笨不过的了？您遭人嫉妒，先生，可这又是谁的过错呢？您的才  干，您的明智的管理，您的趣味高雅的房屋，我给您带来的嫁妆，尤其是我们有望从我那善良的姑母继承的可观遗产，这笔遗产已经被无限地夸大了，却使您成为维里埃的第一号人物。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  forget my birth,' said M. de Renal, with a faint smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您忘了门第，”德·莱纳先生说，略微有了点笑意。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  are one of the most distinguished gentlemen in the province,' Madame de Renal  hastily added; 'if the King were free and could do justice to birth, you would  doubtless be figuring in the House of Peers,' and so forth. 'And in this  magnificent position do you seek to provide jealousy with food for comment?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您是本省最高贵的绅士之一，”德·莱纳夫人赶紧说道，“假使国王是自由的，能够公正对待门第，您肯定会当上贵族院议员。您有这  祥美好的地位，您愿意给嫉妒者以口实，闹得满城风雨吗？</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'To  speak to M. Valenod of his anonymous letter is to proclaim throughout  Verrieres, or rather in Besancon, throughout the Province, that this petty cit,  admitted perhaps imprudently to the friendship of a Renal, has found out a way  to insult him. Did these letters which you have just discovered prove that I  had responded to M. Valenod's overtures, then it would be for you to kill me, I  should have deserved it a hundred times, but not to show anger with him. Think  that all your neighbours only await a pretext to be avenged for your  superiority; think that in 1816 you were instrumental in securing certain  arrests. That man who took refuge on your roof … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>“找瓦勒诺先生去谈他的匿名信，就等于在维里埃，怎么说呢，在贝藏松，在全省宣布，这个小小的市民，—个德·莱纳家的人不慎认为好友的小市民，找到了办法来侮辱他。如果您得到的这些信证明我回报过瓦勒诺先生的爱情，您可以杀死我，我是罪有应得，但不要为他生气。想想吧，您周围的人正等着一个借口来报复您的优越的地位呢；想想吧，一八一六年您曾插手某些逮捕。藏在屋顶上的那个人……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What  I think is that you have neither respect nor affection for me,' shouted M. de  Renal with all the bitterness that such a memory aroused, 'and I have not been  made a Peer!'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我想您对我既无敬意也无友情了，”德·莱纳先生喊道，这样的回忆使他有不胜酸楚之感，“可我并没有当过贵族院议员！</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  think, my friend,' put in Madame de Renal with a smile, 'that I shall one day  be richer than you, that I have been your companion for twelve years, and that  on all these counts I ought to have a voice in your councils, especially in  this business today. If you prefer Monsieur Julien to me,' she added with  ill-concealed scorn, 'I am prepared to go and spend the winter with my aunt.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我想，我的朋友，”德·莱纳夫人含笑道，“我将比您富有，我是您十二年的伴侣，以这样的名义我有权说话，尤其是对今天这件事。  假若您宁要一位于连先生而不要我的话，”她装作满怀怨恨地补充说，“我已准备好去姑妈那儿过冬。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>This  threat was uttered with gladness. It contained the firmness which seeks to  cloak itself in courtesy; it determined M. de Renal. But, obeying the  provincial custom, he continued to speak for a long time, harked back to every  argument in turn; his wife allowed him to speak, there was still anger in his  tone. At length, two hours of futile discourse wore out the strength of a man  who had been helpless with rage all night. He determined upon the line of  conduct which he was going to adopt towards M. Valenod, Julien, and even Elisa.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这句话说得恰到好处，坚决而不失礼貌，使德·莱纳先生拿定了主意。不过，依照外省的习惯，他还说了很久，把所有的理由又过了一遍。他的妻子由他说去，他的口气中还有余怒未消。两个钟头的废话终于耗尽了这个一整夜都在发怒的人的力气。他确定了针对瓦勒诺先生、于连、甚至爱丽莎的行动路线。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Once  or twice, during this great scene, Madame de Renal came within an ace of  feeling a certain sympathy for the very real distress of this man who for ten  years had been her friend. But our true passions are selfish.Moreover  she was expecting every moment an avowal of the anonymous letter which he had  received overnight, and this avowal never came. To gain complete confidence,  Madame de Renal required to know what ideas might have been suggested to the  man upon whom her fate depended. For, in the country, husbands control public  opinion. A husband who denounces his wife covers himself with ridicule, a thing  that every day is becoming less dangerous in France; but his wife, if he does  not supply her with money, declines to the position of a working woman at  fifteen sous daily, and even then the virtuous souls have scruples about  employing her.</p>

<p>在这场紧张的较量中，有一、两次，德·莱纳夫人险些对眼前这个人的极为真实的不幸产生些许同情，他毕竟在过去的十二年中是她的朋友。然而，真正的激情是自私的。再说、她时刻都等着他招认昨晚接到了匿名信，而他只字未提。别人对这个决定她命运的人究竟说了些什么，她还不清楚。在外省，丈夫是舆论的主人。一个口出怨言的丈夫会受到百般嘲笑，这种事情的危险性在法国是一天比一天小了，然而他若不给妻子钱花，妻子就会陷入一天挣十五个苏的女工的境地，而那些好心人要雇用她还得考虑考虑呢。</p>

<p>An  odalisque in the seraglio may love the Sultan with all her heart; he is all  powerful, she has no hope of evading his authority by a succession of clever  little tricks. The master's vengeance is terrible, bloody, but martial and  noble: a dagger blow ends everything. It is with blows dealt by public contempt  that a husband kills his wife in the nineteenth century; it is by shutting the  doors of all the drawing-rooms in her face.</p>

<p>一个土耳其后宫里的女奴可以全力爱她的苏丹，苏丹是万能的，她想施点小诡计窃取他的权力，那是枉费心机。主人的报复是可怕的，血腥的，然而也是有军人气概，痛快的，一刀下去就万事大吉。而在十九世纪，一个丈夫是用公众的轻蔑来杀死妻子的，所有的客厅都对她关上大门。</p>

<p>The  sense of danger was keenly aroused in Madame de Renal on her return to her own  room; she was horrified by the disorder in which she found it. The locks of all  her pretty little boxes had been broken; several planks in the floor had been  torn up. 'He would have been without pity for me!' she told herself. 'To spoil  so this floor of coloured parquet, of which he is so proud; when one of his  children comes in with muddy shoes, he flushes with rage. And now it is ruined  for ever!' The sight of this violence rapidly silenced the last reproaches with  which she had been blaming herself for her too rapid victory.</p>

<p>德·莱纳夫人回到卧室，警觉起来，感到了危险；她大吃一惊，房间里一片狼藉。她那些漂亮的小盒子的锁都被砸烂，细木嵌花的地板也有几块被撬起。“看来他对我毫不留情了！”她暗自说道，“这样毁坏这些彩色细木地板，可他原是多么地喜欢呀；他的孩子中谁要穿着湿鞋走进房里，他总是气红了脸。现在全完了！”看到这种粗暴，她刚才因胜利来得太快而对自己的指责很快便烟消云散。</p>

<p>Shortly  before the dinner bell sounded, Julien returned with the children. At dessert,  when the servants had left the room, Madame de Renal said to him very drily:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>午饭铃声前一会儿，于连带着孩子们回来。上罢饭后果品，仆人们退下，德·莱纳夫人很冷淡地对他说：</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'You  expressed the desire to me to go and spend a fortnight at Verrieres; M. de  Renal is kind enough to grant you leave. You can go as soon as you please. But,  so that the children shall not waste any time, their lessons will be sent to  you every day, for you to correct.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“您曾向我表示想去维里埃呆半个月，德·莱纳先生已经准了假。您什么时候动身都行。不过，为了不让孩子们虚度光阴，他们的作业每  天都会送您批改。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Certainly,'  M. de Renal added in a most bitter tone, 'I shall not allow you more than a  week.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“当然了，”德·莱纳先生用一种很尖刻的声调补充道，“我给您的假不会超过一个礼拜的。”</p>

</div></div>

<p>Julien  read in his features the uneasiness of a man in cruel torment.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>于连从他脸上看出他很不安，一定是内心深处受了重创。</p>

<p>'He  has not yet come to a decision,' he said to his mistress, during a moment of  solitude in the drawing-room.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“他还没有拿定主意，”他对他的情人说，他们有一会儿单独在客厅里。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>Madame  de Renal informed him rapidly of all that she had done since the morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>德·莱纳夫人匆匆跟他讲了从早晨起她做的一切。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'The  details tonight,' she added laughing.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“晚上详谈，”她笑着补充道。</p>

<p>'The  perversity of woman!' thought Julien. 'What pleasure, what instinct leads them  to betray us?</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这就是女人的邪恶啊！”于连想，“什么样的快乐，什么样的本能驱使她们欺骗我们呀：”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'I  find you at once enlightened and blinded by your love,' he said to her with a  certain coldness; 'your behaviour today has been admirable; but is there any  prudence in our attempting to see each other tonight?This  house is paved with enemies; think of the passionate hatred that Elisa has for  me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我觉得爱情既使您明智又使您盲目，”他有些冷淡地对她说，“您今天的行为值得钦佩，可我们今晚还设法见面，这难道是谨慎的吗？  这座房子里到处都是敌人；想想爱丽莎对我们的强烈仇狠吧。”</p>

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'That  hatred greatly resembles the passionate indifference that you must have for  me.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“这种强烈的仇恨倒很像您对我的强烈的冷淡。”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'Indifferent  or not, I am bound to save you from a peril into which I have plunged you. If  chance decrees that M. de Renal speaks to Elisa, by a single word she may  disclose everything to him. What is to prevent him from hiding outside my room,  well armed … '</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“即便是冷淡，我也应该把您从我使您陷入的危险中救出来。万一德·菜纳先生和爱丽莎谈起，只消一句话，她就能什么都告诉他。他为  什么不能藏在我的房间周围，带着家伙……”</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

<p>'What!  Lacking in courage even!' said Madame de Renal, with all the pride of a woman  of noble birth.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“怎么！居然连勇气都没有了：“德·莱纳夫人说，显出十足的贵族小姐的高傲。</p>

</div></div>


<div class="layout">

<p>'I  shall never sink so low as to speak of my courage,' said Julien coldly, 'that  is mean. Let the world judge by my actions. But,' he went on, taking her hand,  'you cannot conceive how attached I am to you, and what a joy it is to me to be  able to take leave of you before this cruel parting.'</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>“我从不降格去谈论我的勇气，”于连冷冷地说，“那是一种可耻的行为。让大家根据事实来评判吧，但是，”他握住了她的手，补充道  ，“您想象不出我是多么地爱慕您，我是多么高兴能在这种残酷的离别之前来向您告别啊！”
