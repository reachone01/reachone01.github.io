THE AUTHOR</p>
<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>A preface to the first edition of “Jane Eyre”
being unnecessary, I gave none: this second edition demands a few
words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.</p>
<p>My thanks are due in three quarters.</p>
<p>To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a
plain tale with few pretensions.</p>
<p>To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has
opened to an obscure aspirant.</p>
<p>To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their
practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and
unrecommended Author.</p>
<p>The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for
me, and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are
definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me
as only large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a
struggling stranger; to them, <i>i.e.</i>, to my Publishers and
the select Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you
from my heart.</p>
<p>Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and
approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I
know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked.&nbsp; I mean the
timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as
“Jane Eyre:” in whose eyes whatever is unusual is
wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
bigotry—that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that
regent of God on earth.&nbsp; I would suggest to such doubters
certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain
simple truths.</p>
<p>Conventionality is not morality.&nbsp; Self-righteousness is
not religion.&nbsp; To attack the first is not to assail the
last.&nbsp; To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is
not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.</p>
<p>These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as
distinct as is vice from virtue.&nbsp; Men too often confound
them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be
mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to
elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the
world-redeeming creed of Christ.&nbsp; There is—I repeat
it—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to
mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them.</p>
<p>The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it
has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make
external show pass for sterling worth—to let white-washed
walls vouch for clean shrines.&nbsp; It may hate him who dares to
scrutinise and expose—to rase the gilding, and show base
metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal
charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.</p>
<p>Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good
concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of
Chenaannah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death,
had he but stopped his ears to flattery, and opened them to
faithful counsel.</p>
<p>There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to
tickle delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great
ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned
Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a
power as prophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and
as daring.&nbsp; Is the satirist of “Vanity Fair”
admired in high places?&nbsp; I cannot tell; but I think if some
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and
over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to
take his warnings in time—they or their seed might yet
escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.</p>
<p>Why have I alluded to this man?&nbsp; I have alluded to him,
Reader, because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and
more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because
I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day—as
the very master of that working corps who would restore to
rectitude the warped system of things; because I think no
commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.&nbsp;
They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic
powers.&nbsp; He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture:
Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.&nbsp;
His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same
relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent
sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does
to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.&nbsp; Finally, I
have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will
accept the tribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated
this second edition of “<span class="smcap">Jane
Eyre</span>.”</p>

<h2>NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h2>
<p>I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of
“Jane Eyre” affords me, of again addressing a word to
the Public, to explain that my claim to the title of novelist
rests on this one work alone.&nbsp; If, therefore, the authorship
of other works of fiction has been attributed to me, an honour is
awarded where it is not merited; and consequently, denied where
it is justly due.</p>
<p>This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may
already have been made, and to prevent future errors.</p>

<p><i>April</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.&nbsp; We
had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in
the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no
company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it
clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further
out-door exercise was now out of the question.</p>
<p>I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on
chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw
twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by
the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the
consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and
Georgiana Reed.</p>
<p>The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round
their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the
fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither
quarrelling nor crying) looked perfectly happy.&nbsp; Me, she had
dispensed from joining the group; saying, “She regretted to
be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that
until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own
observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and
sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural,
as it were—she really must exclude me from privileges
intended only for contented, happy, little children.”</p>
<p>“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners;
besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up
her elders in that manner.&nbsp; Be seated somewhere; and until
you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.”</p>
<p>A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in
there.&nbsp; It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of
a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with
pictures.&nbsp; I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my
feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red
moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
retirement.</p>
<p>Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to
the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not
separating me from the drear November day.&nbsp; At intervals,
while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of
that winter afternoon.&nbsp; Afar, it offered a pale blank of
mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub,
with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
lamentable blast.</p>
<p>I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British
Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally
speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that,
child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.&nbsp; They
were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of “the
solitary rocks and promontories” by them only inhabited; of
the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern
extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—</p>
<blockquote><p>“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast
whirls,<br>
Boils round the naked, melancholy isles<br>
Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge<br>
Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores
of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland,
Greenland, with “the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and
those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of
frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of
centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights,
surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of
extreme cold.”&nbsp; Of these death-white realms I formed
an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended
notions that float dim through children’s brains, but
strangely impressive.&nbsp; The words in these introductory pages
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave
significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and
spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the
cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck
just sinking.</p>
<p>I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary
churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two
trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its
newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.</p>
<p>The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be
marine phantoms.</p>
<p>The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I
passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.</p>
<p>So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock,
surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.</p>
<p>Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly
interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes
narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good
humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery
hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs.
Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed
our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken
from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period
I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of
Moreland.</p>
<p>With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my
way.&nbsp; I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too
soon.&nbsp; The breakfast-room door opened.</p>
<p>“Boh!&nbsp; Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John
Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.</p>
<p>“Where the dickens is she!” he continued.&nbsp;
“Lizzy!&nbsp; Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not
here: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad
animal!”</p>
<p>“It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I
wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would
John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of
vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door,
and said at once—</p>
<p>“She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.”</p>
<p>And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of
being dragged forth by the said Jack.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” I asked, with awkward
diffidence.</p>
<p>“Say, ‘What do you want, Master
Reed?’” was the answer.&nbsp; “I want you to
come here;” and seating himself in an arm-chair, he
intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before
him.</p>
<p>John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years
older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age,
with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious
visage, heavy limbs and large extremities.&nbsp; He gorged
himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him
a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.&nbsp; He ought now to
have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
or two, “on account of his delicate health.”&nbsp;
Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he
had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the
mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and
inclined rather to the more refined idea that John’s
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining
after home.</p>
<p>John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an
antipathy to me.&nbsp; He bullied and punished me; not two or
three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but
continually: every nerve I had feared him, and every morsel of
flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.&nbsp; There were
moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because
I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young
master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and
deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse
me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more
frequently, however, behind her back.</p>
<p>Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent
some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he
could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike,
and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly
appearance of him who would presently deal it.&nbsp; I wonder if
he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without
speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.&nbsp; I tottered, and
on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
chair.</p>
<p>“That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile
since,” said he, “and for your sneaking way of
getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes
two minutes since, you rat!”</p>
<p>Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of
replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would
certainly follow the insult.</p>
<p>“What were you doing behind the curtain?” he
asked.</p>
<p>“I was reading.”</p>
<p>“Show the book.”</p>
<p>I returned to the window and fetched it thence.</p>
<p>“You have no business to take our books; you are a
dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you
none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with
gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals we do,
and wear clothes at our mama’s expense.&nbsp; Now,
I’ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they
<i>are</i> mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few
years.&nbsp; Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the
mirror and the windows.”</p>
<p>I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when
I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I
instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough,
however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my
head against the door and cutting it.&nbsp; The cut bled, the
pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings
succeeded.</p>
<p>“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said.&nbsp; “You
are like a murderer—you are like a slave-driver—you
are like the Roman emperors!”</p>
<p>I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed
my opinion of Nero, Caligula, etc.&nbsp; Also I had drawn
parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared
aloud.</p>
<p>“What! what!” he cried.&nbsp; “Did she say
that to me?&nbsp; Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana?&nbsp;
Won’t I tell mama? but first—”</p>
<p>He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my
shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing.&nbsp; I really
saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.&nbsp; I felt a drop or two of
blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of
somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.&nbsp;
I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he
called me “Rat!&nbsp; Rat!” and bellowed out
aloud.&nbsp; Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene,
followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot.&nbsp; We were parted: I
heard the words—</p>
<p>“Dear! dear!&nbsp; What a fury to fly at Master
John!”</p>
<p>“Did ever anybody see such a picture of
passion!”</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Reed subjoined—</p>
<p>“Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in
there.”&nbsp; Four hands were immediately laid upon me, and
I was borne upstairs.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance
which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot
were disposed to entertain of me.&nbsp; The fact is, I was a
trifle beside myself; or rather <i>out</i> of myself, as the
French would say: I was conscious that a moment’s mutiny
had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like
any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go
all lengths.</p>
<p>“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad
cat.”</p>
<p>“For shame! for shame!” cried the
lady’s-maid.&nbsp; “What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre,
to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son!&nbsp;
Your young master.”</p>
<p>“Master!&nbsp; How is he my master?&nbsp; Am I a
servant?”</p>
<p>“No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for
your keep.&nbsp; There, sit down, and think over your
wickedness.”</p>
<p>They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by
Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise
from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me
instantly.</p>
<p>“If you don’t sit still, you must be tied
down,” said Bessie.&nbsp; “Miss Abbot, lend me your
garters; she would break mine directly.”</p>
<p>Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary
ligature.&nbsp; This preparation for bonds, and the additional
ignominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of
me.</p>
<p>“Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I
will not stir.”</p>
<p>In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my
hands.</p>
<p>“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she
had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her
hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms,
looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my
sanity.</p>
<p>“She never did so before,” at last said Bessie,
turning to the Abigail.</p>
<p>“But it was always in her,” was the reply.&nbsp;
“I’ve told Missis often my opinion about the child,
and Missis agreed with me.&nbsp; She’s an underhand little
thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much
cover.”</p>
<p>Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she
said—“You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under
obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you
off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.”</p>
<p>I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me:
my very first recollections of existence included hints of the
same kind.&nbsp; This reproach of my dependence had become a
vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only
half intelligible.&nbsp; Miss Abbot joined in—</p>
<p>“And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with
the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you
to be brought up with them.&nbsp; They will have a great deal of
money, and you will have none: it is your place to be humble, and
to try to make yourself agreeable to them.”</p>
<p>“What we tell you is for your good,” added Bessie,
in no harsh voice, “you should try to be useful and
pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you
become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am
sure.”</p>
<p>“Besides,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish
her: He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and
then where would she go?&nbsp; Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I
wouldn’t have her heart for anything.&nbsp; Say your
prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you
don’t repent, something bad might be permitted to come down
the chimney and fetch you away.”</p>
<p>They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.</p>
<p>The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I
might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors
at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all
the accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and
stateliest chambers in the mansion.&nbsp; A bed supported on
massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red
damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large
windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded
in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the
table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth;
the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the
wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished
old mahogany.&nbsp; Out of these deep surrounding shades rose
high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of
the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.&nbsp;
Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near
the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.</p>
<p>This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was
silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn,
because it was known to be so seldom entered.&nbsp; The
house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors
and the furniture a week’s quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a
certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers
parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased
husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the
red-room—the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its
grandeur.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he
breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was
borne by the undertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense
of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent
intrusion.</p>
<p>My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me
riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed
rose before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark
wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of
its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great
looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed
and room.&nbsp; I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.&nbsp;
Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure.&nbsp; Returning, I had
to cross before the looking-glass; my fascinated glance
involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.&nbsp; All looked
colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and
the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face
and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving
where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I
thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp,
Bessie’s evening stories represented as coming out of lone,
ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated
travellers.&nbsp; I returned to my stool.</p>
<p>Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet
her hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood
of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter
vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought
before I quailed to the dismal present.</p>
<p>All John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all his
sisters’ proud indifference, all his mother’s
aversion, all the servants’ partiality, turned up in my
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.&nbsp; Why
was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for
ever condemned?&nbsp; Why could I never please?&nbsp; Why was it
useless to try to win any one’s favour?&nbsp; Eliza, who
was headstrong and selfish, was respected.&nbsp; Georgiana, who
had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent
carriage, was universally indulged.&nbsp; Her beauty, her pink
cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked
at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault.&nbsp; John no
one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the necks of
the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the
sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the
buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his
mother “old girl,” too; sometimes reviled her for her
dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes;
not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was
still “her own darling.”&nbsp; I dared commit no
fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from
noon to night.</p>
<p>My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had
received: no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and
because I had turned against him to avert farther irrational
violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.</p>
<p>“Unjust!—unjust!” said my reason, forced by
the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power:
and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange
expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be
effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself
die.</p>
<p>What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary
afternoon!&nbsp; How all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart
in insurrection!&nbsp; Yet in what darkness, what dense
ignorance, was the mental battle fought!&nbsp; I could not answer
the ceaseless inward question—<i>why</i> I thus suffered;
now, at the distance of—I will not say how many years, I
see it clearly.</p>
<p>I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I
had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her
chosen vassalage.&nbsp; If they did not love me, in fact, as
little did I love them.&nbsp; They were not bound to regard with
affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst
them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving
their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing,
cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment, of
contempt of their judgment.&nbsp; I know that had I been a
sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping
child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs.
Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her
children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of
fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make
me the scapegoat of the nursery.</p>
<p>Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four
o’clock, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear
twilight.&nbsp; I heard the rain still beating continuously on
the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind
the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage
sank.&nbsp; My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.&nbsp; All
said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I
been but just conceiving of starving myself to death?&nbsp; That
certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die?&nbsp; Or was the
vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting
bourne?&nbsp; In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it
with gathering dread.&nbsp; I could not remember him; but I knew
that he was my own uncle—my mother’s
brother—that he had taken me when a parentless infant to
his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise
of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her
own children.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept
this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature
would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not
of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s
death, by any tie?&nbsp; It must have been most irksome to find
herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an
uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family
group.</p>
<p>A singular notion dawned upon me.&nbsp; I doubted
not—never doubted—that if Mr. Reed had been alive he
would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at the
white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also turning
a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror—I began
to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves
by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to
punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr.
Reed’s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister’s
child, might quit its abode—whether in the church vault or
in the unknown world of the departed—and rise before me in
this chamber.&nbsp; I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful
lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice
to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending
over me with strange pity.&nbsp; This idea, consolatory in
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm.&nbsp;
Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look
boldly round the dark room; at this moment a light gleamed on the
wall.&nbsp; Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon
penetrating some aperture in the blind?&nbsp; No; moonlight was
still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the
ceiling and quivered over my head.&nbsp; I can now conjecture
readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam
from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then,
prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by
agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some
coming vision from another world.&nbsp; My heart beat thick, my
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing
of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated:
endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in
desperate effort.&nbsp; Steps came running along the outer
passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.</p>
<p>“Miss Eyre, are you ill?” said Bessie.</p>
<p>“What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!”
exclaimed Abbot.</p>
<p>“Take me out!&nbsp; Let me go into the nursery!”
was my cry.</p>
<p>“What for?&nbsp; Are you hurt?&nbsp; Have you seen
something?” again demanded Bessie.</p>
<p>“Oh!&nbsp; I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would
come.”&nbsp; I had now got hold of Bessie’s hand, and
she did not snatch it from me.</p>
<p>“She has screamed out on purpose,” declared Abbot,
in some disgust.&nbsp; “And what a scream!&nbsp; If she had
been in great pain one would have excused it, but she only wanted
to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks.”</p>
<p>“What is all this?” demanded another voice
peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed came along the corridor, her cap
flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.&nbsp; “Abbot and
Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in
the red-room till I came to her myself.”</p>
<p>“Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma’am,” pleaded
Bessie.</p>
<p>“Let her go,” was the only answer.&nbsp;
“Loose Bessie’s hand, child: you cannot succeed in
getting out by these means, be assured.&nbsp; I abhor artifice,
particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is
only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I
shall liberate you then.”</p>
<p>“O aunt! have pity!&nbsp; Forgive me!&nbsp; I cannot
endure it—let me be punished some other way!&nbsp; I shall
be killed if—”</p>
<p>“Silence!&nbsp; This violence is all most
repulsive:” and so, no doubt, she felt it.&nbsp; I was a
precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on me as a
compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
duplicity.</p>
<p>Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my
now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and
locked me in, without farther parley.&nbsp; I heard her sweeping
away; and soon after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of
fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I
had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible
red glare, crossed with thick black bars.&nbsp; I heard voices,
too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of
wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating
sense of terror confused my faculties.&nbsp; Ere long, I became
aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting
me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever
been raised or upheld before.&nbsp; I rested my head against a
pillow or an arm, and felt easy.</p>
<p>In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I
knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare
was the nursery fire.&nbsp; It was night: a candle burnt on the
table; Bessie stood at the bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and
a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.</p>
<p>I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of
protection and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in
the room, an individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not
related to Mrs. Reed.&nbsp; Turning from Bessie (though her
presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot, for
instance, would have been), I scrutinised the face of the
gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes
called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for herself
and the children she employed a physician.</p>
<p>“Well, who am I?” he asked.</p>
<p>I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand:
he took it, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well
by-and-by.”&nbsp; Then he laid me down, and addressing
Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed
during the night.&nbsp; Having given some further directions, and
intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to
my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the
chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all
the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness
weighed it down.</p>
<p>“Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?” asked
Bessie, rather softly.</p>
<p>Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence
might be rough.&nbsp; “I will try.”</p>
<p>“Would you like to drink, or could you eat
anything?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you, Bessie.”</p>
<p>“Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve
o’clock; but you may call me if you want anything in the
night.”</p>
<p>Wonderful civility this!&nbsp; It emboldened me to ask a
question.</p>
<p>“Bessie, what is the matter with me?&nbsp; Am I
ill?”</p>
<p>“You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying;
you’ll be better soon, no doubt.”</p>
<p>Bessie went into the housemaid’s apartment, which was
near.&nbsp; I heard her say—</p>
<p>“Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I
daren’t for my life be alone with that poor child to-night:
she might die; it’s such a strange thing she should have
that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.&nbsp; Missis was rather
too hard.”</p>
<p>Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were
whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell
asleep.&nbsp; I caught scraps of their conversation, from which I
was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject
discussed.</p>
<p>“Something passed her, all dressed in white, and
vanished”—“A great black dog behind
him”—“Three loud raps on the chamber
door”—“A light in the churchyard just over his
grave,” etc., etc.</p>
<p>At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.&nbsp;
For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly
wakefulness; strained by dread: such dread as children only can
feel.</p>
<p>No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident
of the red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel
the reverberation to this day.&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe
some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive
you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my
heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my bad
propensities.</p>
<p>Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a
shawl by the nursery hearth.&nbsp; I felt physically weak and
broken down: but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness
of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears;
no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another
followed.&nbsp; Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for
none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in the
carriage with their mama.&nbsp; Abbot, too, was sewing in another
room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away
toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a
word of unwonted kindness.&nbsp; This state of things should have
been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of
ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my
racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe,
and no pleasure excite them agreeably.</p>
<p>Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with
her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird
of paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had
been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration;
and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in
my hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always
hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege.&nbsp; This
precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially
invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.&nbsp; Vain
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often
wished for, too late!&nbsp; I could not eat the tart; and the
plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely
faded: I put both plate and tart away.&nbsp; Bessie asked if I
would have a book: the word <i>book</i> acted as a transient
stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver’s Travels from
the library.&nbsp; This book I had again and again perused with
delight.&nbsp; I considered it a narrative of facts, and
discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in
fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain
among foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the
ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my
mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to
some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and
the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag
being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I
doubted not that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see
with my own eyes the little fields, houses, and trees, the
diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of the one
realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the
monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.&nbsp;
Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my
hand—when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its
marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to
find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.&nbsp; I
closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on
the table, beside the untasted tart.</p>
<p>Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and
having washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full
of splendid shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new
bonnet for Georgiana’s doll.&nbsp; Meantime she sang: her
song was—</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the days when we went gipsying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had often heard the song before, and always with lively
delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,—at least, I thought
so.&nbsp; But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in
its melody an indescribable sadness.&nbsp; Sometimes, preoccupied
with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly;
“A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence
of a funeral hymn.&nbsp; She passed into another ballad, this
time a really doleful one.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My feet they are sore, and my limbs they
are weary;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;<br>
Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the path of the poor orphan child.</p>
<p>Why did they send me so far and so lonely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are
piled?<br>
Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan
child.</p>
<p>Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,<br>
God, in His mercy, protection is showing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.</p>
<p>Ev’n should I fall o’er the broken bridge
passing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or stray in the marshes, by false lights
beguiled,<br>
Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.</p>
<p>There is a thought that for strength should avail me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;<br>
Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; God is a friend to the poor orphan child.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Come, Miss Jane, don’t cry,” said Bessie as
she finished.&nbsp; She might as well have said to the fire,
“don’t burn!” but how could she divine the
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?&nbsp; In the course of
the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.</p>
<p>“What, already up!” said he, as he entered the
nursery.&nbsp; “Well, nurse, how is she?”</p>
<p>Bessie answered that I was doing very well.</p>
<p>“Then she ought to look more cheerful.&nbsp; Come here,
Miss Jane: your name is Jane, is it not?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.”</p>
<p>“Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you
tell me what about?&nbsp; Have you any pain?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Oh!&nbsp; I daresay she is crying because she could not
go out with Missis in the carriage,” interposed Bessie.</p>
<p>“Surely not! why, she is too old for such
pettishness.”</p>
<p>I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the
false charge, I answered promptly, “I never cried for such
a thing in my life: I hate going out in the carriage.&nbsp; I cry
because I am miserable.”</p>
<p>“Oh fie, Miss!” said Bessie.</p>
<p>The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.&nbsp; I was
standing before him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his
eyes were small and grey; not very bright, but I dare say I
should think them shrewd now: he had a hard-featured yet
good-natured looking face.&nbsp; Having considered me at leisure,
he said—</p>
<p>“What made you ill yesterday?”</p>
<p>“She had a fall,” said Bessie, again putting in
her word.</p>
<p>“Fall! why, that is like a baby again!&nbsp; Can’t
she manage to walk at her age?&nbsp; She must be eight or nine
years old.”</p>
<p>“I was knocked down,” was the blunt explanation,
jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride; “but
that did not make me ill,” I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped
himself to a pinch of snuff.</p>
<p>As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud
bell rang for the servants’ dinner; he knew what it
was.&nbsp; “That’s for you, nurse,” said he;
“you can go down; I’ll give Miss Jane a lecture till
you come back.”</p>
<p>Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go,
because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead
Hall.</p>
<p>“The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?”
pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie was gone.</p>
<p>“I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till
after dark.”</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.</p>
<p>“Ghost!&nbsp; What, you are a baby after all!&nbsp; You
are afraid of ghosts?”</p>
<p>“Of Mr. Reed’s ghost I am: he died in that room,
and was laid out there.&nbsp; Neither Bessie nor any one else
will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel
to shut me up alone without a candle,—so cruel that I think
I shall never forget it.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!&nbsp; And is it that makes you so
miserable?&nbsp; Are you afraid now in daylight?”</p>
<p>“No: but night will come again before long: and
besides,—I am unhappy,—very unhappy, for other
things.”</p>
<p>“What other things?&nbsp; Can you tell me some of
them?”</p>
<p>How much I wished to reply fully to this question!&nbsp; How
difficult it was to frame any answer!&nbsp; Children can feel,
but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is
partially effected in thought, they know not how to express the
result of the process in words.&nbsp; Fearful, however, of losing
this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a
meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.</p>
<p>“For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or
sisters.”</p>
<p>“You have a kind aunt and cousins.”</p>
<p>Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced—</p>
<p>“But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up
in the red-room.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful
house?” asked he.&nbsp; “Are you not very thankful to
have such a fine place to live at?”</p>
<p>“It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less
right to be here than a servant.”</p>
<p>“Pooh! you can’t be silly enough to wish to leave
such a splendid place?”</p>
<p>“If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave
it; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a
woman.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you may—who knows?&nbsp; Have you any
relations besides Mrs. Reed?”</p>
<p>“I think not, sir.”</p>
<p>“None belonging to your father?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.&nbsp; I asked Aunt Reed once, and
she said possibly I might have some poor, low relations called
Eyre, but she knew nothing about them.”</p>
<p>“If you had such, would you like to go to
them?”</p>
<p>I reflected.&nbsp; Poverty looks grim to grown people; still
more so to children: they have not much idea of industrious,
working, respectable poverty; they think of the word only as
connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude
manners, and debasing vices: poverty for me was synonymous with
degradation.</p>
<p>“No; I should not like to belong to poor people,”
was my reply.</p>
<p>“Not even if they were kind to you?”</p>
<p>I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means
of being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt
their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor
women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their
clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I
was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of
caste.</p>
<p>“But are your relatives so very poor?&nbsp; Are they
working people?”</p>
<p>“I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must
be a beggarly set: I should not like to go a begging.”</p>
<p>“Would you like to go to school?”</p>
<p>Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie
sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the
stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly
genteel and precise: John Reed hated his school, and abused his
master; but John Reed’s tastes were no rule for mine, and
if Bessie’s accounts of school-discipline (gathered from
the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I
thought, equally attractive.&nbsp; She boasted of beautiful
paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs
they could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could
net, of French books they could translate; till my spirit was
moved to emulation as I listened.&nbsp; Besides, school would be
a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.</p>
<p>“I should indeed like to go to school,” was the
audible conclusion of my musings.</p>
<p>“Well, well! who knows what may happen?” said Mr.
Lloyd, as he got up.&nbsp; “The child ought to have change
of air and scene,” he added, speaking to himself;
“nerves not in a good state.”</p>
<p>Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard
rolling up the gravel-walk.</p>
<p>“Is that your mistress, nurse?” asked Mr.
Lloyd.&nbsp; “I should like to speak to her before I
go.”</p>
<p>Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led
the way out.&nbsp; In the interview which followed between him
and Mrs. Reed, I presume, from after-occurrences, that the
apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school; and the
recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as Abbot
said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing
in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as they
thought, asleep, “Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to
get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always
looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots
underhand.”&nbsp; Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being
a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.</p>
<p>On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss
Abbot’s communications to Bessie, that my father had been a
poor clergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes
of her friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my
grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her
off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been
married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting
among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was
situated, and where that disease was then prevalent: that my
mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
of each other.</p>
<p>Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said,
“Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied, too, Abbot.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” responded Abbot; “if she were a nice,
pretty child, one might compassionate her forlornness; but one
really cannot care for such a little toad as that.”</p>
<p>“Not a great deal, to be sure,” agreed Bessie:
“at any rate, a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more
moving in the same condition.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!” cried the fervent
Abbot.&nbsp; “Little darling!—with her long curls and
her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as if she
were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for
supper.”</p>
<p>“So could I—with a roast onion.&nbsp; Come,
we’ll go down.”&nbsp; They went.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported
conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to
suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed
near,—I desired and waited it in silence.&nbsp; It tarried,
however: days and weeks passed: I had regained my normal state of
health, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I
brooded.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye,
but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a more
marked line of separation than ever between me and her own
children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself,
condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the
nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the
drawing-room.&nbsp; Not a hint, however, did she drop about
sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for
her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an
insuperable and rooted aversion.</p>
<p>Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders,
spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his
cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as
I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of
deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption
before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me tittering
execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.&nbsp; I had indeed
levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted
him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to
purpose; but he was already with his mama.&nbsp; I heard him in a
blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane
Eyre” had flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped
rather harshly—</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not
to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that
either you or your sisters should associate with her.”</p>
<p>Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and
without at all deliberating on my words—</p>
<p>“They are not fit to associate with me.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this
strange and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair,
swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down
on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise
from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of
the day.</p>
<p>“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were
alive?” was my scarcely voluntary demand.&nbsp; I say
scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced
words without my will consenting to their utterance: something
spoke out of me over which I had no control.</p>
<p>“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her
usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like
fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she
really did not know whether I were child or fiend.&nbsp; I was
now in for it.</p>
<p>“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and
think; and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all
day long, and how you wish me dead.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly,
she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word.&nbsp;
Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length,
in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and
abandoned child ever reared under a roof.&nbsp; I half believed
her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my
breast.</p>
<p>November, December, and half of January passed away.&nbsp;
Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with
the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners
and evening parties given.&nbsp; From every enjoyment I was, of
course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing
the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them
descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks
and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp
played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and
footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were
handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room
door opened and closed.&nbsp; When tired of this occupation, I
would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent
nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable.&nbsp;
To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for
in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been
kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend
the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the
formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and
gentlemen.&nbsp; But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young
ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the
kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally bearing the
candle along with her.&nbsp; I then sat with my doll on my knee
till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure
that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when
the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at
knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold
and darkness in my crib.&nbsp; To this crib I always took my
doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of
worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
scarecrow.&nbsp; It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd
sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and
capable of sensation.&nbsp; I could not sleep unless it was
folded in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I
was comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.</p>
<p>Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the
company, and listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the
stairs: sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her
thimble or her scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way
of supper—a bun or a cheese-cake—then she would sit
on the bed while I ate it, and when I had finished, she would
tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me, and said,
“Good night, Miss Jane.”&nbsp; When thus gentle,
Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the
world; and I wished most intensely that she would always be so
pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task
me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do.&nbsp; Bessie
Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for
she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me
by her nursery tales.&nbsp; She was pretty too, if my
recollections of her face and person are correct.&nbsp; I
remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes,
very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a
capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle
or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one
else at Gateshead Hall.</p>
<p>It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in
the morning: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had
not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her
bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an
occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling the
eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus
obtained.&nbsp; She had a turn for traffic, and a marked
propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and
chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener
about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary
having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the
products of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have
sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome
profit thereby.&nbsp; As to her money, she first secreted it in
odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of
these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza,
fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to
intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of
interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she
exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with
anxious accuracy.</p>
<p>Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass,
and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded
feathers, of which she had found a store in a drawer in the
attic.&nbsp; I was making my bed, having received strict orders
from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie
now frequently employed me as a sort of under-nurserymaid, to
tidy the room, dust the chairs, &amp;c.).&nbsp; Having spread the
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put
in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture
scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her
playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy
plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and
then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the
frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus
clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on
the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the
influence of a hard frost.</p>
<p>From this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the
carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the
silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out,
I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through.&nbsp; I
watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often
came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was
interested; it stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang
loudly, the new-comer was admitted.&nbsp; All this being nothing
to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on
the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall
near the casement.&nbsp; The remains of my breakfast of bread and
milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I
was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill,
when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.</p>
<p>“Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing
there?&nbsp; Have you washed your hands and face this
morning?”&nbsp; I gave another tug before I answered, for I
wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I
scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—</p>
<p>“No, Bessie; I have only just finished
dusting.”</p>
<p>“Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing
now?&nbsp; You look quite red, as if you had been about some
mischief: what were you opening the window for?”</p>
<p>I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in
too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the
washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my
face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined
my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then
hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as
I was wanted in the breakfast-room.</p>
<p>I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if
Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed
the nursery-door upon me.&nbsp; I slowly descended.&nbsp; For
nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed’s
presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast,
dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
which it dismayed me to intrude.</p>
<p>I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the
breakfast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and
trembling.&nbsp; What a miserable little poltroon had fear,
engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!&nbsp;
I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to
the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the
vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I
<i>must</i> enter.</p>
<p>“Who could want me?” I asked inwardly, as with
both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or
two, resisted my efforts.&nbsp; “What should I see besides
Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a woman?”&nbsp;
The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and
curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such,
at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow,
sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the
top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of
capital.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a
signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the
stony stranger with the words: “This is the little girl
respecting whom I applied to you.”</p>
<p><i>He</i>, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards
where I stood, and having examined me with the two
inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of
bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, “Her size
is small: what is her age?”</p>
<p>“Ten years.”</p>
<p>“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he
prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes.&nbsp; Presently he
addressed me—“Your name, little girl?”</p>
<p>“Jane Eyre, sir.”</p>
<p>In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall
gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large,
and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and
prim.</p>
<p>“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”</p>
<p>Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little
world held a contrary opinion: I was silent.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed
answered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon,
“Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr.
Brocklehurst.”</p>
<p>“Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some
talk;” and bending from the perpendicular, he installed his
person in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed’s.&nbsp;
“Come here,” he said.</p>
<p>I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight
before him.&nbsp; What a face he had, now that it was almost on a
level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what
large prominent teeth!</p>
<p>“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he
began, “especially a naughty little girl.&nbsp; Do you know
where the wicked go after death?”</p>
<p>“They go to hell,” was my ready and orthodox
answer.</p>
<p>“And what is hell?&nbsp; Can you tell me
that?”</p>
<p>“A pit full of fire.”</p>
<p>“And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be
burning there for ever?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“What must you do to avoid it?”</p>
<p>I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was
objectionable: “I must keep in good health, and not
die.”</p>
<p>“How can you keep in good health?&nbsp; Children younger
than you die daily.&nbsp; I buried a little child of five years
old only a day or two since,—a good little child, whose
soul is now in heaven.&nbsp; It is to be feared the same could
not be said of you were you to be called hence.”</p>
<p>Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my
eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed,
wishing myself far enough away.</p>
<p>“I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent
of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent
benefactress.”</p>
<p>“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly:
“they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a
benefactress is a disagreeable thing.”</p>
<p>“Do you say your prayers night and morning?”
continued my interrogator.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you read your Bible?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes.”</p>
<p>“With pleasure?&nbsp; Are you fond of it?”</p>
<p>“I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis
and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings
and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.”</p>
<p>“And the Psalms?&nbsp; I hope you like them?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“No? oh, shocking!&nbsp; I have a little boy, younger
than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him
which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse
of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the verse of a Psalm!
angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a little
angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for
his infant piety.”</p>
<p>“Psalms are not interesting,” I remarked.</p>
<p>“That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray
to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take
away your heart of stone and give you a heart of
flesh.”</p>
<p>I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in
which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed,
when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then
proceeded to carry on the conversation herself.</p>
<p>“Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter
which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has
not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you
admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the
superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye
on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
tendency to deceit.&nbsp; I mention this in your hearing, Jane,
that you may not attempt to impose on Mr.
Brocklehurst.”</p>
<p>Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was
her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her
presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I
strove to please her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid
by such sentences as the above.&nbsp; Now, uttered before a
stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of
existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could
not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and
unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under
Mr. Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and
what could I do to remedy the injury?</p>
<p>“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to
repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent
evidences of my anguish.</p>
<p>“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said
Mr. Brocklehurst; “it is akin to falsehood, and all liars
will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and
brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed.&nbsp; I
will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”</p>
<p>“I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting
her prospects,” continued my benefactress; “to be
made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will,
with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.”</p>
<p>“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,”
returned Mr. Brocklehurst.&nbsp; “Humility is a Christian
grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I,
therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its
cultivation amongst them.&nbsp; I have studied how best to
mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.&nbsp; My second
daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on
her return she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and
plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind
their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland
pockets outside their frocks—they are almost like poor
people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘they looked
at my dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk
gown before.’”</p>
<p>“This is the state of things I quite approve,”
returned Mrs. Reed; “had I sought all England over, I could
scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like
Jane Eyre.&nbsp; Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I
advocate consistency in all things.”</p>
<p>“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties;
and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the
establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire,
unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is
the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants.”</p>
<p>“Quite right, sir.&nbsp; I may then depend upon this
child being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being
trained in conformity to her position and prospects?”</p>
<p>“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of
chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the
inestimable privilege of her election.”</p>
<p>“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr.
Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of
a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.”</p>
<p>“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good
morning.&nbsp; I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course
of a week or two: my good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit
me to leave him sooner.&nbsp; I shall send Miss Temple notice
that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will be no
difficulty about receiving her.&nbsp; Good-bye.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and
Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master
Broughton Brocklehurst.”</p>
<p>“I will, madam.&nbsp; Little girl, here is a book
entitled the ‘Child’s Guide,’ read it with
prayer, especially that part containing ‘An account of the
awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
falsehood and deceit.’”</p>
<p>With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin
pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he
departed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in
silence; she was sewing, I was watching her.&nbsp; Mrs. Reed
might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; she was a
woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not
tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat large
face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose
sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye
devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly
flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness never
came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household
and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only
at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she
dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
handsome attire.</p>
<p>Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I
examined her figure; I perused her features.&nbsp; In my hand I
held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which
narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate
warning.&nbsp; What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said
concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had
felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a
passion of resentment fomented now within me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine,
her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble
movements.</p>
<p>“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was
her mandate.&nbsp; My look or something else must have struck her
as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed
irritation.&nbsp; I got up, I went to the door; I came back
again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up to
her.</p>
<p><i>Speak</i> I must: I had been trodden on severely, and
<i>must</i> turn: but how?&nbsp; What strength had I to dart
retaliation at my antagonist?&nbsp; I gathered my energies and
launched them in this blunt sentence—</p>
<p>“I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved
you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of
anybody in the world except John Reed; and this book about the
liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who
tells lies, and not I.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her
eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine.</p>
<p>“What more have you to say?” she asked, rather in
the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age
than such as is ordinarily used to a child.</p>
<p>That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I
had.&nbsp; Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable
excitement, I continued—</p>
<p>“I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never
call you aunt again as long as I live.&nbsp; I will never come to
see you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked
you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you
makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable
cruelty.”</p>
<p>“How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?”</p>
<p>“How dare I, Mrs. Reed?&nbsp; How dare I?&nbsp; Because
it is the <i>truth</i>.&nbsp; You think I have no feelings, and
that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot
live so: and you have no pity.&nbsp; I shall remember how you
thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me
back—into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying
day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while suffocating
with distress, ‘Have mercy!&nbsp; Have mercy, Aunt
Reed!’&nbsp; And that punishment you made me suffer because
your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for
nothing.&nbsp; I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this
exact tale.&nbsp; People think you a good woman, but you are bad,
hard-hearted.&nbsp; <i>You</i> are deceitful!”</p>

</a></p>
<p>Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to
exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever
felt.&nbsp; It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that
I had struggled out into unhoped-for liberty.&nbsp; Not without
cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; her work
had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her hands, rocking
herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she would
cry.</p>
<p>“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with
you?&nbsp; Why do you tremble so violently?&nbsp; Would you like
to drink some water?”</p>
<p>“No, Mrs. Reed.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?&nbsp; I
assure you, I desire to be your friend.”</p>
<p>“Not you.&nbsp; You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad
character, a deceitful disposition; and I’ll let everybody
at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done.”</p>
<p>“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children
must be corrected for their faults.”</p>
<p>“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage,
high voice.</p>
<p>“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and
now return to the nursery—there’s a dear—and
lie down a little.”</p>
<p>“I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to
school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.”</p>
<p>“I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured
Mrs. Reed <i>sotto voce</i>; and gathering up her work, she
abruptly quitted the apartment.</p>
<p>I was left there alone—winner of the field.&nbsp; It was
the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had
gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had
stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s solitude.&nbsp; First,
I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure
subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
pulses.&nbsp; A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had
done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I
had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of
remorse and the chill of reaction.&nbsp; A ridge of lighted
heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem
of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge,
black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when
half-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown me the
madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating
position.</p>
<p>Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as
aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its
after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if
I had been poisoned.&nbsp; Willingly would I now have gone and
asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I knew, partly from
experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent
impulse of my nature.</p>
<p>I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce
speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling
than that of sombre indignation.&nbsp; I took a book—some
Arabian tales; I sat down and endeavoured to read.&nbsp; I could
make no sense of the subject; my own thoughts swam always between
me and the page I had usually found fascinating.&nbsp; I opened
the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite
still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze,
through the grounds.&nbsp; I covered my head and arms with the
skirt of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the
plantation which was quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure
in the silent trees, the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics
of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now
stiffened together.&nbsp; I leaned against a gate, and looked
into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short
grass was nipped and blanched.&nbsp; It was a very grey day; a
most opaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all;
thence flakes felt it intervals, which settled on the hard path
and on the hoary lea without melting.&nbsp; I stood, a wretched
child enough, whispering to myself over and over again,
“What shall I do?—what shall I do?”</p>
<p>All at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane!
where are you?&nbsp; Come to lunch!”</p>
<p>It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her
light step came tripping down the path.</p>
<p>“You naughty little thing!” she said.&nbsp;
“Why don’t you come when you are called?”</p>
<p>Bessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which
I had been brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she
was somewhat cross.&nbsp; The fact is, after my conflict with and
victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to care much for the
nursemaid’s transitory anger; and I <i>was</i> disposed to
bask in her youthful lightness of heart.&nbsp; I just put my two
arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t
scold.”</p>
<p>The action was more frank and fearless than any I was
habituated to indulge in: somehow it pleased her.</p>
<p>“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as
she looked down at me; “a little roving, solitary thing:
and you are going to school, I suppose?”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor
Bessie?”</p>
<p>“What does Bessie care for me?&nbsp; She is always
scolding me.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy
little thing.&nbsp; You should be bolder.”</p>
<p>“What! to get more knocks?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!&nbsp; But you are rather put upon,
that’s certain.&nbsp; My mother said, when she came to see
me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to
be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some good
news for you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you have, Bessie.”</p>
<p>“Child! what do you mean?&nbsp; What sorrowful eyes you
fix on me!&nbsp; Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master
John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea
with me.&nbsp; I’ll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and
then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon
to pack your trunk.&nbsp; Missis intends you to leave Gateshead
in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take
with you.”</p>
<p>“Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till
I go.”</p>
<p>“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and
don’t be afraid of me.&nbsp; Don’t start when I
chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so
provoking.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you
again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon
have another set of people to dread.”</p>
<p>“If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”</p>
<p>“As you do, Bessie?”</p>
<p>“I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder
of you than of all the others.”</p>
<p>“You don’t show it.”</p>
<p>“You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new
way of talking.&nbsp; What makes you so venturesome and
hardy?”</p>
<p>“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and
besides”—I was going to say something about what had
passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I
considered it better to remain silent on that head.</p>
<p>“And so you’re glad to leave me?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather
sorry.”</p>
<p>“Just now! and rather!&nbsp; How coolly my little lady
says it!&nbsp; I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you
wouldn’t give it me: you’d say you’d
<i>rather</i> not.”</p>
<p>“I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head
down.”&nbsp; Bessie stooped; we mutually embraced, and I
followed her into the house quite comforted.&nbsp; That afternoon
lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me
some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
sweetest songs.&nbsp; Even for me life had its gleams of
sunshine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>Five o’clock had hardly struck on the morning of the
19th of January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and
found me already up and nearly dressed.&nbsp; I had risen
half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put
on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose
rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.&nbsp; I was
to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge
gates at six a.m.&nbsp; Bessie was the only person yet risen; she
had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my
breakfast.&nbsp; Few children can eat when excited with the
thoughts of a journey; nor could I.&nbsp; Bessie, having pressed
me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread
she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and
bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the
nursery.&nbsp; As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said,
“Will you go in and bid Missis good-bye?”</p>
<p>“No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you
were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the
morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remember that
she had always been my best friend, and to speak of her and be
grateful to her accordingly.”</p>
<p>“What did you say, Miss?”</p>
<p>“Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and
turned from her to the wall.”</p>
<p>“That was wrong, Miss Jane.”</p>
<p>“It was quite right, Bessie.&nbsp; Your Missis has not
been my friend: she has been my foe.”</p>
<p>“O Miss Jane! don’t say so!”</p>
<p>“Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as we passed
through the hall and went out at the front door.</p>
<p>The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a
lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden
by a recent thaw.&nbsp; Raw and chill was the winter morning: my
teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive.&nbsp; There was a
light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached it, we found
the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which
had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the
door.&nbsp; It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after
that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the
coming coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach
rapidly through the gloom.</p>
<p>“Is she going by herself?” asked the
porter’s wife.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And how far is it?”</p>
<p>“Fifty miles.”</p>
<p>“What a long way!&nbsp; I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid
to trust her so far alone.”</p>
<p>The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four
horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman
loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from
Bessie’s neck, to which I clung with kisses.</p>
<p>“Be sure and take good care of her,” cried she to
the guard, as he lifted me into the inside.</p>
<p>“Ay, ay!” was the answer: the door was slapped to,
a voice exclaimed “All right,” and on we drove.&nbsp;
Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away
to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious
regions.</p>
<p>I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day
seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to
travel over hundreds of miles of road.&nbsp; We passed through
several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped;
the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to
dine.&nbsp; I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me
to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an
immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent
from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the
wall filled with musical instruments.&nbsp; Here I walked about
for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive
of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in
kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in
Bessie’s fireside chronicles.&nbsp; At last the guard
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector
mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we
rattled over the “stony street” of L-.</p>
<p>The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into
dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from
Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed;
great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight
deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after
night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing
amongst trees.</p>
<p>Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long
slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the
coach-door was open, and a person like a servant was standing at
it: I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps.</p>
<p>“Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?”
she asked.&nbsp; I answered “Yes,” and was then
lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly
drove away.</p>
<p>I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise
and motion of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about
me.&nbsp; Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless,
I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through
this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it
behind her.&nbsp; There was now visible a house or
houses—for the building spread far—with many windows,
and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path,
splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led
me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me
alone.</p>
<p>I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I
looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from
the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains,
shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or
splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable
enough.&nbsp; I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture
on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a
light entered; another followed close behind.</p>
<p>The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a
pale and large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a
shawl, her countenance was grave, her bearing erect.</p>
<p>“The child is very young to be sent alone,” said
she, putting her candle down on the table.&nbsp; She considered
me attentively for a minute or two, then further added—</p>
<p>“She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are
you tired?” she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“A little, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper
before she goes to bed, Miss Miller.&nbsp; Is this the first time
you have left your parents to come to school, my little
girl?”</p>
<p>I explained to her that I had no parents.&nbsp; She inquired
how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my
name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she
touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying,
“She hoped I should be a good child,” dismissed me
along with Miss Miller.</p>
<p>The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who
went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me
by her voice, look, and air.&nbsp; Miss Miller was more ordinary;
ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in
gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks
on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really
was, an under-teacher.&nbsp; Led by her, I passed from
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large
and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and
somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we
had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently
entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each
end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all
round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine
or ten to twenty.&nbsp; Seen by the dim light of the dips, their
number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding
eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.&nbsp; It was the hour
of study; they were engaged in conning over their
to-morrow’s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined
result of their whispered repetitions.</p>
<p>Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then
walking up to the top of the long room she cried out—</p>
<p>“Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them
away!”</p>
<p>Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round,
gathered the books and removed them.&nbsp; Miss Miller again gave
the word of command—</p>
<p>“Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!”</p>
<p>The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a
tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged
thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each
tray.&nbsp; The portions were handed round; those who liked took
a draught of the water, the mug being common to all.&nbsp; When
it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch
the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of
eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared
into fragments.</p>
<p>The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the
classes filed off, two and two, upstairs.&nbsp; Overpowered by
this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place
the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was
very long.&nbsp; To-night I was to be Miss Miller’s
bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at
the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and
amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.</p>
<p>The night passed rapidly.&nbsp; I was too tired even to dream;
I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the
rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had
taken her place by my side.&nbsp; When I again unclosed my eyes,
a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dressing; day had
not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the
room.&nbsp; I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I
dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there
was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was
but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the
room.&nbsp; Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two,
and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and
dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller;
afterwards she called out—</p>
<p>“Form classes!”</p>
<p>A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss
Miller repeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and
“Order!”&nbsp; When it subsided, I saw them all drawn
up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four
tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.&nbsp; A pause
of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of
numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this
indefinite sound.</p>
<p>A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the
room, each walked to a table and took her seat.&nbsp; Miss Miller
assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door,
and around which the smallest of the children were assembled: to
this inferior class I was called, and placed at the bottom of
it.</p>
<p>Business now began, the day’s Collect was repeated, then
certain texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a
protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an
hour.&nbsp; By the time that exercise was terminated, day had
fully dawned.&nbsp; The indefatigable bell now sounded for the
fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
something to eat!&nbsp; I was now nearly sick from inanition,
having taken so little the day before.</p>
<p>The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two
long tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my
dismay, sent forth an odour far from inviting.&nbsp; I saw a
universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the
repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it; from the
van of the procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose
the whispered words—</p>
<p>“Disgusting!&nbsp; The porridge is burnt
again!”</p>
<p>“Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss
Miller, but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark
personage, smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who
installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom
lady presided at the other.&nbsp; I looked in vain for her I had
first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I
afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other
board.&nbsp; A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a
servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal
began.</p>
<p>Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of
my portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of
hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess;
burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself
soon sickens over it.&nbsp; The spoons were moved slowly: I saw
each girl taste her food and try to swallow it; but in most cases
the effort was soon relinquished.&nbsp; Breakfast was over, and
none had breakfasted.&nbsp; Thanks being returned for what we had
not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated
for the schoolroom.&nbsp; I was one of the last to go out, and in
passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the
porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their
countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout
one, whispered—</p>
<p>“Abominable stuff!&nbsp; How shameful!”</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during
which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of
time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and
they used their privilege.&nbsp; The whole conversation ran on
the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly.&nbsp; Poor
things! it was the sole consolation they had.&nbsp; Miss Miller
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls
standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.&nbsp;
I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at
which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no
great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in
it.</p>
<p>A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her
circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried—</p>
<p>“Silence!&nbsp; To your seats!”</p>
<p>Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was
resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel
clamour of tongues.&nbsp; The upper teachers now punctually
resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait.&nbsp; Ranged
on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat
motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all with
plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the
throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a
Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and
destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing
woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass
buckles.&nbsp; Above twenty of those clad in this costume were
full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill, and
gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.</p>
<p>I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining
the teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the
stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce,
the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing!
looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked—when, as my
eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose
simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.</p>
<p>What was the matter?&nbsp; I had heard no order given: I was
puzzled.&nbsp; Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again
seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine
followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who
had received me last night.&nbsp; She stood at the bottom of the
long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she
surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.&nbsp; Miss
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having
received her answer, went back to her place, and said
aloud—</p>
<p>“Monitor of the first class, fetch the
globes!”</p>
<p>While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted
moved slowly up the room.&nbsp; I suppose I have a considerable
organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe
with which my eyes traced her steps.&nbsp; Seen now, in broad
daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a
benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each
of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in
round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when
neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress,
also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a
sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches
were not so common then as now) shone at her girdle.&nbsp; Let
the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and
he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a
correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple,
as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted
to me to carry to church.</p>
<p>The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having
taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the
tables, summoned the first class round her, and commenced giving
a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the
teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &amp;c., went on for
an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were
given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.&nbsp; The
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last
struck twelve.&nbsp; The superintendent rose—</p>
<p>“I have a word to address to the pupils,” said
she.</p>
<p>The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking
forth, but it sank at her voice.&nbsp; She went on—</p>
<p>“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not
eat; you must be hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of
bread and cheese shall be served to all.”</p>
<p>The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.</p>
<p>“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she
added, in an explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards
left the room.</p>
<p>The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed,
to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school.&nbsp;
The order was now given “To the garden!”&nbsp; Each
put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico,
and a cloak of grey frieze.&nbsp; I was similarly equipped, and,
following the stream, I made my way into the open air.</p>
<p>The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high
as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran
down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided
into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens
for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner.&nbsp;
When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now,
at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown
decay.&nbsp; I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was
an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but
darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still
soaking wet with the floods of yesterday.&nbsp; The stronger
among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry
pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the
verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to
their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow
cough.</p>
<p>As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take
notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of
isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much.&nbsp; I
leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close
about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without,
and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered
myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.&nbsp; My
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I
hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed
floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague
and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture.&nbsp;
I looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the
house—a large building, half of which seemed grey and old,
the other half quite new.&nbsp; The new part, containing the
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed
windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over
the door bore this inscription:—</p>
<p>“Lowood Institution.—This portion was rebuilt A.D.
---, by Naomi Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this
county.”&nbsp; “Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which
is in heaven.”—St. Matt. v. 16.</p>
<p>I read these words over and over again: I felt that an
explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate
their import.&nbsp; I was still pondering the signification of
“Institution,” and endeavouring to make out a
connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my
head.&nbsp; I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was
bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from
where I stood I could see the title—it was
“Rasselas;” a name that struck me as strange, and
consequently attractive.&nbsp; In turning a leaf she happened to
look up, and I said to her directly—</p>
<p>“Is your book interesting?”&nbsp; I had already
formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day.</p>
<p>“I like it,” she answered, after a pause of a
second or two, during which she examined me.</p>
<p>“What is it about?” I continued.&nbsp; I hardly
know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with
a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I
think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I
too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I
could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.</p>
<p>“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering
me the book.</p>
<p>I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents
were less taking than the title: “Rasselas” looked
dull to my trifling taste; I saw nothing about fairies, nothing
about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the
closely-printed pages.&nbsp; I returned it to her; she received
it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb
her—</p>
<p>“Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the
door means?&nbsp; What is Lowood Institution?”</p>
<p>“This house where you are come to live.”</p>
<p>“And why do they call it Institution?&nbsp; Is it in any
way different from other schools?”</p>
<p>“It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the
rest of us, are charity-children.&nbsp; I suppose you are an
orphan: are not either your father or your mother
dead?”</p>
<p>“Both died before I can remember.”</p>
<p>“Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both
parents, and this is called an institution for educating
orphans.”</p>
<p>“Do we pay no money?&nbsp; Do they keep us for
nothing?”</p>
<p>“We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for
each.”</p>
<p>“Then why do they call us charity-children?”</p>
<p>“Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and
teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by
subscription.”</p>
<p>“Who subscribes?”</p>
<p>“Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in
this neighbourhood and in London.”</p>
<p>“Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?”</p>
<p>“The lady who built the new part of this house as that
tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything
here.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because he is treasurer and manager of the
establishment.”</p>
<p>“Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who
wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and
cheese?”</p>
<p>“To Miss Temple?&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; I wish it did: she
has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for all she does.&nbsp; Mr.
Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes.”</p>
<p>“Does he live here?”</p>
<p>“No—two miles off, at a large hall.”</p>
<p>“Is he a good man?”</p>
<p>“He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of
good.”</p>
<p>“Did you say that tall lady was called Miss
Temple?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And what are the other teachers called?”</p>
<p>“The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she
attends to the work, and cuts out—for we make our own
clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and everything; the little one
with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and
grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who
wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side
with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle,
in France, and teaches French.”</p>
<p>“Do you like the teachers?”</p>
<p>“Well enough.”</p>
<p>“Do you like the little black one, and the Madame
---?—I cannot pronounce her name as you do.”</p>
<p>“Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to
offend her; Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of
person.”</p>
<p>“But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t
she?”</p>
<p>“Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above
the rest, because she knows far more than they do.”</p>
<p>“Have you been long here?”</p>
<p>“Two years.”</p>
<p>“Are you an orphan?”</p>
<p>“My mother is dead.”</p>
<p>“Are you happy here?”</p>
<p>“You ask rather too many questions.&nbsp; I have given
you answers enough for the present: now I want to
read.”</p>
<p>But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all
re-entered the house.&nbsp; The odour which now filled the
refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had
regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in two
huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of
rancid fat.&nbsp; I found the mess to consist of indifferent
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked
together.&nbsp; Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful
was apportioned to each pupil.&nbsp; I ate what I could, and
wondered within myself whether every day’s fare would be
like this.</p>
<p>After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom:
lessons recommenced, and were continued till five
o’clock.</p>
<p>The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the
girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in
disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to
stand in the middle of the large schoolroom.&nbsp; The punishment
seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so
great a girl—she looked thirteen or upwards.&nbsp; I
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to
my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave,
she stood, the central mark of all eyes.&nbsp; “How can she
bear it so quietly—so firmly?” I asked of
myself.&nbsp; “Were I in her place, it seems to me I should
wish the earth to open and swallow me up.&nbsp; She looks as if
she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond
her situation: of something not round her nor before her.&nbsp; I
have heard of day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now?&nbsp;
Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see
it—her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she
is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is
really present.&nbsp; I wonder what sort of a girl she
is—whether good or naughty.”</p>
<p>Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a
small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.&nbsp; I
devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should
have been glad of as much more—I was still hungry.&nbsp;
Half-an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then the
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.&nbsp;
Such was my first day at Lowood.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by
rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the
ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.&nbsp;
A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening,
and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our
bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds,
and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.</p>
<p>Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading
was over, I felt ready to perish with cold.&nbsp; Breakfast-time
came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the
quality was eatable, the quantity small.&nbsp; How small my
portion seemed!&nbsp; I wished it had been doubled.</p>
<p>In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth
class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me:
hitherto, I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at
Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein.&nbsp; At first,
being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared
to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from task to
task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
o’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a
border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble,
&amp;c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom,
with directions to hem the same.&nbsp; At that hour most of the
others were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss
Scatcherd’s chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner
in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.&nbsp; It was
English history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of
the verandah: at the commencement of the lesson, her place had
been at the top of the class, but for some error of
pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, she was suddenly
sent to the very bottom.&nbsp; Even in that obscure position,
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant
notice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the
following:—</p>
<p>“Burns” (such it seems was her name: the girls
here were all called by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere),
“Burns, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn
your toes out immediately.”&nbsp; “Burns, you poke
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.”&nbsp;
“Burns, I insist on your holding your head up; I will not
have you before me in that attitude,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>A chapter having been read through twice, the books were
closed and the girls examined.&nbsp; The lesson had comprised
part of the reign of Charles I., and there were sundry questions
about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of them
appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was
solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed to have
retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
with answers on every point.&nbsp; I kept expecting that Miss
Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she
suddenly cried out—</p>
<p>“You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned
your nails this morning!”</p>
<p>Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.&nbsp;
“Why,” thought I, “does she not explain that
she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water
was frozen?”</p>
<p>My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to
hold a skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to
me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school
before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &amp;c.; till she
dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss
Scatcherd’s movements.&nbsp; When I returned to my seat,
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch
the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into
the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half
a minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at
one end.&nbsp; This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd
with a respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being
told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and
sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of
twigs.&nbsp; Not a tear rose to Burns’ eye; and, while I
paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this
spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not
a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary
expression.</p>
<p>“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd;
“nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry
the rod away.”</p>
<p>Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her
pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.</p>
<p>The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest
fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of
coffee swallowed at five o’clock had revived vitality, if
it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was
slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the
morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more
brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not
yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the
confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.</p>
<p>On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd
flog her pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and
tables and laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling
lonely: when I passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind,
and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already forming
against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I
could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.</p>
<p>Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents,
this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have
regretted the separation; that wind would then have saddened my
heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it
was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and
feverish, I wished the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to
deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.</p>
<p>Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way
to one of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire
fender, I found Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all
round her by the companionship of a book, which she read by the
dim glare of the embers.</p>
<p>“Is it still ‘Rasselas’?” I asked,
coming behind her.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “and I have just finished
it.”</p>
<p>And in five minutes more she shut it up.&nbsp; I was glad of
this.&nbsp; “Now,” thought I, “I can perhaps
get her to talk.”&nbsp; I sat down by her on the floor.</p>
<p>“What is your name besides Burns?”</p>
<p>“Helen.”</p>
<p>“Do you come a long way from here?”</p>
<p>“I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders
of Scotland.”</p>
<p>“Will you ever go back?”</p>
<p>“I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the
future.”</p>
<p>“You must wish to leave Lowood?”</p>
<p>“No! why should I?&nbsp; I was sent to Lowood to get an
education; and it would be of no use going away until I have
attained that object.”</p>
<p>“But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to
you?”</p>
<p>“Cruel?&nbsp; Not at all!&nbsp; She is severe: she
dislikes my faults.”</p>
<p>“And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I
should resist her.&nbsp; If she struck me with that rod, I should
get it from her hand; I should break it under her
nose.”</p>
<p>“Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you
did, Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would
be a great grief to your relations.&nbsp; It is far better to
endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to
commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all
connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good
for evil.”</p>
<p>“But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be
sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are
such a great girl: I am far younger than you, and I could not
bear it.”</p>
<p>“Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not
avoid it: it is weak and silly to say you <i>cannot bear</i> what
it is your fate to be required to bear.”</p>
<p>I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine
of endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise
with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.&nbsp; Still
I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to
my eyes.&nbsp; I suspected she might be right and I wrong; but I
would not ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a
more convenient season.</p>
<p>“You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?&nbsp; To
me you seem very good.”</p>
<p>“Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am,
as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep,
things, in order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I
should learn my lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say,
like you, I cannot <i>bear</i> to be subjected to systematic
arrangements.&nbsp; This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd,
who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular.”</p>
<p>“And cross and cruel,” I added; but Helen Burns
would not admit my addition: she kept silence.</p>
<p>“Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss
Scatcherd?”</p>
<p>At the utterance of Miss Temple’s name, a soft smile
flitted over her grave face.</p>
<p>“Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be
severe to any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my
errors, and tells me of them gently; and, if I do anything worthy
of praise, she gives me my meed liberally.&nbsp; One strong proof
of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her
expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most
highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and
foresight.”</p>
<p>“That is curious,” said I, “it is so easy to
be careful.”</p>
<p>“For <i>you</i> I have no doubt it is.&nbsp; I observed
you in your class this morning, and saw you were closely
attentive: your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller
explained the lesson and questioned you.&nbsp; Now, mine
continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss
Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I
lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of
dream.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that
the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook
which runs through Deepden, near our house;—then, when it
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having
heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary
brook, I have no answer ready.”</p>
<p>“Yet how well you replied this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been
reading had interested me.&nbsp; This afternoon, instead of
dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who wished to do
right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First
sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his
integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no farther than the
prerogatives of the crown.&nbsp; If he had but been able to look
to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age
was tending!&nbsp; Still, I like Charles—I respect
him—I pity him, poor murdered king!&nbsp; Yes, his enemies
were the worst: they shed blood they had no right to shed.&nbsp;
How dared they kill him!”</p>
<p>Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could
not very well understand her—that I was ignorant, or nearly
so, of the subject she discussed.&nbsp; I recalled her to my
level.</p>
<p>“And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts
wander then?”</p>
<p>“No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has
generally something to say which is newer than my own
reflections; her language is singularly agreeable to me, and the
information she communicates is often just what I wished to
gain.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?”</p>
<p>“Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as
inclination guides me.&nbsp; There is no merit in such
goodness.”</p>
<p>“A great deal: you are good to those who are good to
you.&nbsp; It is all I ever desire to be.&nbsp; If people were
always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the
wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never
feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse
and worse.&nbsp; When we are struck at without a reason, we
should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so
hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it
again.”</p>
<p>“You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older:
as yet you are but a little untaught girl.”</p>
<p>“But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who,
whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must
resist those who punish me unjustly.&nbsp; It is as natural as
that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to
punishment when I feel it is deserved.”</p>
<p>“Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but
Christians and civilised nations disown it.”</p>
<p>“How?&nbsp; I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor
vengeance that most certainly heals injury.”</p>
<p>“What then?”</p>
<p>“Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says,
and how He acts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your
example.”</p>
<p>“What does He say?”</p>
<p>“Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good
to them that hate you and despitefully use you.”</p>
<p>“Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I
should bless her son John, which is impossible.”</p>
<p>In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded
forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings
and resentments.&nbsp; Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke
as I felt, without reserve or softening.</p>
<p>Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then
make a remark, but she said nothing.</p>
<p>“Well,” I asked impatiently, “is not Mrs.
Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?”</p>
<p>“She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see,
she dislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine;
but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to
you!&nbsp; What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems
to have made on your heart!&nbsp; No ill-usage so brands its
record on my feelings.&nbsp; Would you not be happier if you
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate
emotions it excited?&nbsp; Life appears to me too short to be
spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.&nbsp; We are,
and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but
the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in
putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will
fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle
of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire
the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be
communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass
through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten
to the seraph!&nbsp; Surely it will never, on the contrary, be
suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?&nbsp; No; I cannot
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me,
and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which
I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a
rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.&nbsp;
Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between
the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first
while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my
heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never
crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the
end.”</p>
<p>Helen’s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as
she finished this sentence.&nbsp; I saw by her look she wished no
longer to talk to me, but rather to converse with her own
thoughts.&nbsp; She was not allowed much time for meditation: a
monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming in a
strong Cumberland accent—</p>
<p>“Helen Burns, if you don’t go and put your drawer
in order, and fold up your work this minute, I’ll tell Miss
Scatcherd to come and look at it!”</p>
<p>Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the
monitor without reply as without delay.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden
age either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in
habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks.&nbsp; The
fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the
physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.</p>
<p>During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows,
and, after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented
our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but
within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open
air.&nbsp; Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the
severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and
melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with
chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and
stiff toes into my shoes in the morning.&nbsp; Then the scanty
supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of
growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a
delicate invalid.&nbsp; From this deficiency of nourishment
resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils:
whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.&nbsp; Many a
time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of
brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a
third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the
remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me
by the exigency of hunger.</p>
<p>Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.&nbsp; We had
to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron
officiated.&nbsp; We set out cold, we arrived at church colder:
during the morning service we became almost paralysed.&nbsp; It
was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat
and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our
ordinary meals, was served round between the services.</p>
<p>At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an
exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing
over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the
skin from our faces.</p>
<p>I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along
our drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind
fluttered, gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by
precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward,
as she said, “like stalwart soldiers.”&nbsp; The
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much
dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.</p>
<p>How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we
got back!&nbsp; But, to the little ones at least, this was
denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded
by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger
children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their
pinafores.</p>
<p>A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double
ration of bread—a whole, instead of a half,
slice—with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of
butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked
forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.&nbsp; I generally contrived to
reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the
remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.</p>
<p>The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the
Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of
St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss
Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness.&nbsp; A
frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the
part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who,
overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third
loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.&nbsp;
The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the
schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was
finished.&nbsp; Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank
together in a heap; they were then propped up with the
monitors’ high stools.</p>
<p>I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and
indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of
the first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay
with his friend the archdeacon: his absence was a relief to
me.&nbsp; I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading
his coming: but come he did at last.</p>
<p>One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I
was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long
division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught
sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively
that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the school,
teachers included, rose <i>en masse</i>, it was not necessary for
me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus
greeted.&nbsp; A long stride measured the schoolroom, and
presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the
same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the
hearthrug of Gateshead.&nbsp; I now glanced sideways at this
piece of architecture.&nbsp; Yes, I was right: it was Mr.
Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
narrower, and more rigid than ever.</p>
<p>I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition;
too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed
about my disposition, &amp;c.; the promise pledged by Mr.
Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my
vicious nature.&nbsp; All along I had been dreading the
fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily
for the “Coming Man,” whose information respecting my
past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for
ever: now there he was.</p>
<p>He stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in
her ear: I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my
villainy; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting
every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of
repugnance and contempt.&nbsp; I listened too; and as I happened
to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.</p>
<p>“I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton
will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for
the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match.&nbsp; You
may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the
darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next
week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than one
at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
careless and lose them.&nbsp; And, O ma’am!&nbsp; I wish
the woollen stockings were better looked to!—when I was
here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the
clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in
a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in them I
was sure they had not been well mended from time to
time.”</p>
<p>He paused.</p>
<p>“Your directions shall be attended to, sir,” said
Miss Temple.</p>
<p>“And, ma’am,” he continued, “the
laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in
the week: it is too much; the rules limit them to one.”</p>
<p>“I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.&nbsp;
Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some
friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on
clean tuckers for the occasion.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.</p>
<p>“Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the
circumstance occur too often.&nbsp; And there is another thing
which surprised me; I find, in settling accounts with the
housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has
twice been served out to the girls during the past
fortnight.&nbsp; How is this?&nbsp; I looked over the
regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned.&nbsp;
Who introduced this innovation? and by what authority?”</p>
<p>“I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,”
replied Miss Temple: “the breakfast was so ill prepared
that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I dared not allow
them to remain fasting till dinner-time.”</p>
<p>“Madam, allow me an instant.&nbsp; You are aware that my
plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to
habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy,
patient, self-denying.&nbsp; Should any little accidental
disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a
meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident
ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more
delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating
the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the
spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to
evince fortitude under temporary privation.&nbsp; A brief address
on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the
sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of
martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling
upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His
warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine
consolations, “If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake,
happy are ye.”&nbsp; Oh, madam, when you put bread and
cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children’s
mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little
think how you starve their immortal souls!”</p>
<p>Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his
feelings.&nbsp; Miss Temple had looked down when he first began
to speak to her; but she now gazed straight before her, and her
face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the
coldness and fixity of that material; especially her mouth,
closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s chisel to
open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
severity.</p>
<p>Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his
hands behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole
school.&nbsp; Suddenly his eye gave a blink, as if it had met
something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he
said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used—</p>
<p>“Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—<i>what</i> is
that girl with curled hair?&nbsp; Red hair, ma’am,
curled—curled all over?”&nbsp; And extending his cane
he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did
so.</p>
<p>“It is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very
quietly.</p>
<p>“Julia Severn, ma’am!&nbsp; And why has she, or
any other, curled hair?&nbsp; Why, in defiance of every precept
and principle of this house, does she conform to the world so
openly—here in an evangelical, charitable
establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of
curls?”</p>
<p>“Julia’s hair curls naturally,” returned
Miss Temple, still more quietly.</p>
<p>“Naturally!&nbsp; Yes, but we are not to conform to
nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why
that abundance?&nbsp; I have again and again intimated that I
desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly.&nbsp;
Miss Temple, that girl’s hair must be cut off entirely; I
will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too
much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn
round.&nbsp; Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their
faces to the wall.”</p>
<p>Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to
smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the
order, however, and when the first class could take in what was
required of them, they obeyed.&nbsp; Leaning a little back on my
bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they
commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could
not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he
might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was
further beyond his interference than he imagined.</p>
<p>He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five
minutes, then pronounced sentence.&nbsp; These words fell like
the knell of doom—</p>
<p>“All those top-knots must be cut off.”</p>
<p>Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.</p>
<p>“Madam,” he pursued, “I have a Master to
serve whose kingdom is not of this world: my mission is to
mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach them to
clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with
braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons
before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think
of the time wasted, of—”</p>
<p>Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors,
ladies, now entered the room.&nbsp; They ought to have come a
little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were
splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs.&nbsp; The two
younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had
grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes,
and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady
was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and
she wore a false front of French curls.</p>
<p>These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as
Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of
honour at the top of the room.&nbsp; It seems they had come in
the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been
conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he
transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the
laundress, and lectured the superintendent.&nbsp; They now
proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith,
who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of
the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said;
other matters called off and enchanted my attention.</p>
<p>Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst
and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected
precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would
be effected, if I could only elude observation.&nbsp; To this
end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be
busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my
treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and
falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon
me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the
two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst.&nbsp;
It came.</p>
<p>“A careless girl!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and
immediately after—“It is the new pupil, I
perceive.”&nbsp; And before I could draw breath, “I
must not forget I have a word to say respecting her.”&nbsp;
Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me!&nbsp; “Let the child
who broke her slate come forward!”</p>
<p>Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed:
but the two great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my
legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple
gently assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered
counsel—</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident;
you shall not be punished.”</p>
<p>The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.</p>
<p>“Another minute, and she will despise me for a
hypocrite,” thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed,
Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the
conviction.&nbsp; I was no Helen Burns.</p>
<p>“Fetch that stool,” said Mr. Brocklehurst,
pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen:
it was brought.</p>
<p>“Place the child upon it.”</p>
<p>And I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in
no condition to note particulars; I was only aware that they had
hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose,
that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange
and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended
and waved below me.</p>
<p>Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.</p>
<p>“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family,
“Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this
girl?”</p>
<p>Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like
burning-glasses against my scorched skin.</p>
<p>“You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the
ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given her the
shape that He has given to all of us; no signal deformity points
her out as a marked character.&nbsp; Who would think that the
Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her?&nbsp; Yet
such, I grieve to say, is the case.”</p>
<p>A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my
nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the
trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.</p>
<p>“My dear children,” pursued the black marble
clergyman, with pathos, “this is a sad, a melancholy
occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who
might be one of God’s own lambs, is a little castaway: not
a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an
alien.&nbsp; You must be on your guard against her; you must shun
her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from
your sports, and shut her out from your converse.&nbsp; Teachers,
you must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well
her words, scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her
soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue
falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a
Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl
is—a liar!”</p>
<p>Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time
in perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female
Brocklehursts produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them
to their optics, while the elderly lady swayed herself to and
fro, and the two younger ones whispered, “How
shocking!”&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.</p>
<p>“This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious
and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared
her as her own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the
unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that
at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from
her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example should
contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be healed,
even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to
allow the waters to stagnate round her.”</p>
<p>With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the
top button of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who
rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed
in state from the room.&nbsp; Turning at the door, my judge
said—</p>
<p>“Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and
let no one speak to her during the remainder of the
day.”</p>
<p>There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not
bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of
the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of
infamy.&nbsp; What my sensations were no language can describe;
but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my
throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her
eyes.&nbsp; What a strange light inspired them!&nbsp; What an
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!&nbsp; How the
new feeling bore me up!&nbsp; It was as if a martyr, a hero, had
passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the
transit.&nbsp; I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head,
and took a firm stand on the stool.&nbsp; Helen Burns asked some
slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at
me as she again went by.&nbsp; What a smile!&nbsp; I remember it
now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of
true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her
sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an
angel.&nbsp; Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
“the untidy badge;” scarcely an hour ago I had heard
her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on
the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it
out.&nbsp; Such is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are
there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss
Scatcherd’s can only see those minute defects, and are
blind to the full brightness of the orb.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was
dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea.&nbsp; I
now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a
corner and sat down on the floor.&nbsp; The spell by which I had
been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and
soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank
prostrate with my face to the ground.&nbsp; Now I wept: Helen
Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I
abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards.&nbsp; I had
meant to be so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many
friends, to earn respect and win affection.&nbsp; Already I had
made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the head
of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to
let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement
two months longer: and then I was well received by my
fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of my own age, and
not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden
on; and could I ever rise more?</p>
<p>“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to
die.&nbsp; While sobbing out this wish in broken accents, some
one approached: I started up—again Helen Burns was near me;
the fading fires just showed her coming up the long, vacant room;
she brought my coffee and bread.</p>
<p>“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both
away from me, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked
me in my present condition.&nbsp; Helen regarded me, probably
with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried
hard; I continued to weep aloud.&nbsp; She sat down on the ground
near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an
Indian.&nbsp; I was the first who spoke—</p>
<p>“Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody
believes to be a liar?”</p>
<p>“Everybody, Jane?&nbsp; Why, there are only eighty
people who have heard you called so, and the world contains
hundreds of millions.”</p>
<p>“But what have I to do with millions?&nbsp; The eighty,
I know, despise me.”</p>
<p>“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school
either despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you
much.”</p>
<p>“How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has
said?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great
and admired man: he is little liked here; he never took steps to
make himself liked.&nbsp; Had he treated you as an especial
favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert, all
around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy
if they dared.&nbsp; Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you
for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will
ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary
suppression.&nbsp; Besides, Jane”—she paused.</p>
<p>“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers:
she chafed my fingers gently to warm them, and went on—</p>
<p>“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked,
while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from
guilt, you would not be without friends.”</p>
<p>“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is
not enough: if others don’t love me I would rather die than
live—I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen.&nbsp;
Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple,
or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have
the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand
behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my
chest—”</p>
<p>“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human
beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand
that created your frame, and put life into it, has provided you
with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures
feeble as you.&nbsp; Besides this earth, and besides the race of
men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that
world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch
us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying
in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred
crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if
innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr.
Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand
from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes
and on your clear front), and God waits only the separation of
spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.&nbsp; Why,
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is
so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to
happiness—to glory?”</p>
<p>I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she
imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.&nbsp; I
felt the impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell
whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she breathed a
little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my
own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.</p>
<p>Resting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round
her waist; she drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.&nbsp;
We had not sat long thus, when another person came in.&nbsp; Some
heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the
moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near,
shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at
once recognised as Miss Temple.</p>
<p>“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said
she; “I want you in my room; and as Helen Burns is with
you, she may come too.”</p>
<p>We went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had
to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before
we reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked
cheerful.&nbsp; Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a
low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and herself taking
another, she called me to her side.</p>
<p>“Is it all over?” she asked, looking down at my
face.&nbsp; “Have you cried your grief away?”</p>
<p>“I am afraid I never shall do that.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I have been wrongly accused; and you,
ma’am, and everybody else, will now think me
wicked.”</p>
<p>“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my
child.&nbsp; Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy
us.”</p>
<p>“Shall I, Miss Temple?”</p>
<p>“You will,” said she, passing her arm round
me.&nbsp; “And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr.
Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife.&nbsp; My uncle is
dead, and he left me to her care.”</p>
<p>“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own
accord?”</p>
<p>“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my
uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got her to promise
before he died that she would always keep me.”</p>
<p>“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you,
that when a criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in
his own defence.&nbsp; You have been charged with falsehood;
defend yourself to me as well as you can.&nbsp; Say whatever your
memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate
nothing.”</p>
<p>I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most
moderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes
in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all
the story of my sad childhood.&nbsp; Exhausted by emotion, my
language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed
that sad theme; and mindful of Helen’s warnings against the
indulgence of resentment, I infused into the narrative far less
of gall and wormwood than ordinary.&nbsp; Thus restrained and
simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that
Miss Temple fully believed me.</p>
<p>In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having
come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me,
frightful episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my
excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing
could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched
my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon,
and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.</p>
<p>I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in
silence; she then said—</p>
<p>“I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if
his reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly
cleared from every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear
now.”</p>
<p>She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was
well contented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure
from the contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two
ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shining curls,
and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.</p>
<p>“How are you to-night, Helen?&nbsp; Have you coughed
much to-day?”</p>
<p>“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“And the pain in your chest?”</p>
<p>“It is a little better.”</p>
<p>Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then
she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh
low.&nbsp; She was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself,
she said cheerfully—</p>
<p>“But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you
as such.”&nbsp; She rang her bell.</p>
<p>“Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered
it, “I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups
for these two young ladies.”</p>
<p>And a tray was soon brought.&nbsp; How pretty, to my eyes, did
the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round
table near the fire!&nbsp; How fragrant was the steam of the
beverage, and the scent of the toast! of which, however, I, to my
dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a very
small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.</p>
<p>“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a
little more bread and butter?&nbsp; There is not enough for
three.”</p>
<p>Barbara went out: she returned soon—</p>
<p>“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual
quantity.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman
after Mr. Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts
of whalebone and iron.</p>
<p>“Oh, very well!” returned Miss Temple; “we
must make it do, Barbara, I suppose.”&nbsp; And as the girl
withdrew she added, smiling, “Fortunately, I have it in my
power to supply deficiencies for this once.”</p>
<p>Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed
before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel
of toast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a
parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a
good-sized seed-cake.</p>
<p>“I meant to give each of you some of this to take with
you,” said she, “but as there is so little toast, you
must have it now,” and she proceeded to cut slices with a
generous hand.</p>
<p>We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the
least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification
with which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished
appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied.</p>
<p>Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the
fire; we sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation
followed between her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege
to be admitted to hear.</p>
<p>Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of
state in her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which
precluded deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager:
something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her
and listened to her, by a controlling sense of awe; and such was
my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with
wonder.</p>
<p>The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and
kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all
these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers
within her.&nbsp; They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in
the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour I had never
seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre
of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular
than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine
colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of
movement, of radiance.&nbsp; Then her soul sat on her lips, and
language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.&nbsp; Has a girl
of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the
swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?&nbsp; Such was
the characteristic of Helen’s discourse on that, to me,
memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a
very brief span as much as many live during a protracted
existence.</p>
<p>They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and
times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature
discovered or guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had
read!&nbsp; What stores of knowledge they possessed!&nbsp; Then
they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but
my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if
she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father
had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of
veneration expanding at every sounding line.&nbsp; She had
scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could
be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us
to her heart—</p>
<p>“God bless you, my children!”</p>
<p>Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more
reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was
for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped
a tear from her cheek.</p>
<p>On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd:
she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen
Burns’s, and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp
reprimand, and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen
of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.</p>
<p>“My things were indeed in shameful disorder,”
murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: “I intended to have
arranged them, but I forgot.”</p>
<p>Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters
on a piece of pasteboard the word “Slattern,” and
bound it like a phylactery round Helen’s large, mild,
intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.&nbsp; She wore it till
evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
punishment.&nbsp; The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after
afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into
the fire: the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in
my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been
scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave
me an intolerable pain at the heart.</p>
<p>About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated,
Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer:
it appeared that what he said went to corroborate my
account.&nbsp; Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school,
announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged
against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.&nbsp; The
teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of
pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.</p>
<p>Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work
afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I
toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my
memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise
sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher
class; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French
and drawing.&nbsp; I learned the first two tenses of the verb
<i>Etre</i>, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls,
by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of
Pisa), on the same day.&nbsp; That night, on going to bed, I
forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot
roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was
wont to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the
spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the
work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet
paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds
picking at ripe cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing
pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays.&nbsp; I
examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able
to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame
Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my
satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.</p>
<p>Well has Solomon said—“Better is a dinner of herbs
where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.”</p>
<p>I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations
for Gateshead and its daily luxuries.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood
lessened.&nbsp; Spring drew on: she was indeed already come; the
frosts of winter had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting
winds ameliorated.&nbsp; My wretched feet, flayed and swollen to
lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside
under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no
longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our
veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial,
and a greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening
daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night,
and left each morning brighter traces of her steps.&nbsp; Flowers
peeped out amongst the leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple
auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.&nbsp; On Thursday afternoons
(half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still sweeter
flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.</p>
<p>I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which
the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and
spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in
prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in
verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and
sparkling eddies.&nbsp; How different had this scene looked when
I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death
wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks,
and rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with
the frozen fog of the beck!&nbsp; That beck itself was then a
torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent
a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, <i>that</i>
showed only ranks of skeletons.</p>
<p>April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of
blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales
filled up its duration.&nbsp; And now vegetation matured with
vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all green, all
flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to
majestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its
recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, and it
made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild
primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in
overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.&nbsp;
All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost
alone: for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause,
to which it now becomes my task to advert.</p>
<p>Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I
speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the
verge of a stream?&nbsp; Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether
healthy or not is another question.</p>
<p>That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and
fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening
spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its
crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived,
transformed the seminary into an hospital.</p>
<p>Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of
the pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty
girls lay ill at one time.&nbsp; Classes were broken up, rules
relaxed.&nbsp; The few who continued well were allowed almost
unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the
necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it
been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain
them.&nbsp; Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by
the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it
except to snatch a few hours’ rest at night.&nbsp; The
teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing
to remove them from the seat of contagion.&nbsp; Many, already
smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were
buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding
delay.</p>
<p>While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and
death its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within
its walls; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital
smells, the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the
effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the
bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors.&nbsp; Its garden,
too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees,
lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of
the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their
scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all
useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now
and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.</p>
<p>But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the
beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood,
like gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went
where we liked: we lived better too.&nbsp; Mr. Brocklehurst and
his family never came near Lowood now: household matters were not
scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by
the fear of infection; her successor, who had been matron at the
Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode, provided
with comparative liberality.&nbsp; Besides, there were fewer to
feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better
filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which
often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a
thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us
to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and
dined sumptuously.</p>
<p>My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white
and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at
by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished
barefoot.&nbsp; The stone was just broad enough to accommodate,
comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage,
whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty
and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at
my ease.&nbsp; Some years older than I, she knew more of the
world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my
curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample
indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said.&nbsp;
She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to
inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving
much entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual
intercourse.</p>
<p>And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?&nbsp; Why did I not
spend these sweet days of liberty with her?&nbsp; Had I forgotten
her? or was I so worthless as to have grown tired of her pure
society?&nbsp; Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was
inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing
stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to
indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was
qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse
a taste of far higher things.</p>
<p>True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a
defective being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I
never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a
sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any
that ever animated my heart.&nbsp; How could it be otherwise,
when Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for
me a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never
soured, nor irritation never troubled?&nbsp; But Helen was ill at
present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
knew not what room upstairs.&nbsp; She was not, I was told, in
the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for
her complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I,
in my ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care
would be sure to alleviate.</p>
<p>I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice
coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken
by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was
not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the
schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much
wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.</p>
<p>One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very
late with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated
ourselves from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we
lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man
and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that
fed on the mast in the wood.&nbsp; When we got back, it was after
moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon’s, was
standing at the garden door.&nbsp; Mary Ann remarked that she
supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent
for at that time of the evening.&nbsp; She went into the house; I
stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of
roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither
if I left them till the morning.&nbsp; This done, I lingered yet
a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it
was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow;
the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east.&nbsp; I was
noting these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it
entered my mind as it had never done before:—</p>
<p>“How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in
danger of dying!&nbsp; This world is pleasant—it would be
dreary to be called from it, and to have to go who knows
where?”</p>
<p>And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend
what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for
the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time
glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an
unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood—the
present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it
shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that
chaos.&nbsp; While pondering this new idea, I heard the front
door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.&nbsp;
After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about
to close the door, but I ran up to her.</p>
<p>“How is Helen Burns?”</p>
<p>“Very poorly,” was the answer.</p>
<p>“Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And what does he say about her?”</p>
<p>“He says she’ll not be here long.”</p>
<p>This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only
conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to
Northumberland, to her own home.&nbsp; I should not have
suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instantly
now!&nbsp; It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going
to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there
were.&nbsp; I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill
of grief, then a desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked
in what room she lay.</p>
<p>“She is in Miss Temple’s room,” said the
nurse.</p>
<p>“May I go up and speak to her?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, child!&nbsp; It is not likely; and now it is
time for you to come in; you’ll catch the fever if you stop
out when the dew is falling.”</p>
<p>The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side
entrance which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was
nine o’clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go
to bed.</p>
<p>It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when
I—not having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from
the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my companions were all
wrapt in profound repose—rose softly, put on my frock over
my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and
set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room.&nbsp; It was quite
at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light
of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage
windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty.&nbsp; An odour
of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever
room: and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who
sat up all night should hear me.&nbsp; I dreaded being discovered
and sent back; for I <i>must</i> see Helen,—I must embrace
her before she died,—I must give her one last kiss,
exchange with her one last word.</p>
<p>Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house
below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two
doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and
then just opposite to me was Miss Temple’s room.&nbsp; A
light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a
profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.&nbsp; Coming near, I
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air
into the close abode of sickness.&nbsp; Indisposed to hesitate,
and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering
with keen throes—I put it back and looked in.&nbsp; My eye
sought Helen, and feared to find death.</p>
<p>Close by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its
white curtains, there stood a little crib.&nbsp; I saw the
outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the
hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an
easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the
table.&nbsp; Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the
fever-room.&nbsp; I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my
hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I
withdrew it.&nbsp; I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a
corpse.</p>
<p>“Helen!” I whispered softly, “are you
awake?”</p>
<p>She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face,
pale, wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed
that my fear was instantly dissipated.</p>
<p>“Can it be you, Jane?” she asked, in her own
gentle voice.</p>
<p>“Oh!” I thought, “she is not going to die;
they are mistaken: she could not speak and look so calmly if she
were.”</p>
<p>I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold,
and her cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist;
but she smiled as of old.</p>
<p>“Why are you come here, Jane?&nbsp; It is past eleven
o’clock: I heard it strike some minutes since.”</p>
<p>“I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill,
and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.”</p>
<p>“You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time
probably.”</p>
<p>“Are you going somewhere, Helen?&nbsp; Are you going
home?”</p>
<p>“Yes; to my long home—my last home.”</p>
<p>“No, no, Helen!”&nbsp; I stopped,
distressed.&nbsp; While I tried to devour my tears, a fit of
coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when
it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
whispered—</p>
<p>“Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover
yourself with my quilt.”</p>
<p>I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to
her.&nbsp; After a long silence, she resumed, still
whispering—</p>
<p>“I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am
dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve
about.&nbsp; We all must die one day, and the illness which is
removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is
at rest.&nbsp; I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a
father; and he is lately married, and will not miss me.&nbsp; By
dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.&nbsp; I had not
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I
should have been continually at fault.”</p>
<p>“But where are you going to, Helen?&nbsp; Can you
see?&nbsp; Do you know?”</p>
<p>“I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.”</p>
<p>“Where is God?&nbsp; What is God?”</p>
<p>“My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He
created.&nbsp; I rely implicitly on His power, and confide wholly
in His goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one arrives
which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me.”</p>
<p>“You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place
as heaven, and that our souls can get to it when we
die?”</p>
<p>“I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is
good; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any
misgiving.&nbsp; God is my father; God is my friend: I love Him;
I believe He loves me.”</p>
<p>“And shall I see you again, Helen, when I
die?”</p>
<p>“You will come to the same region of happiness: be
received by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear
Jane.”</p>
<p>Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.&nbsp;
“Where is that region?&nbsp; Does it exist?”&nbsp;
And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me
than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my
face hidden on her neck.&nbsp; Presently she said, in the
sweetest tone—</p>
<p>“How comfortable I am!&nbsp; That last fit of coughing
has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but
don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have you near
me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay with you, <i>dear</i> Helen: no one
shall take me away.”</p>
<p>“Are you warm, darling?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Good-night, Jane.”</p>
<p>“Good-night, Helen.”</p>
<p>She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.</p>
<p>When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I
looked up; I was in somebody’s arms; the nurse held me; she
was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory.&nbsp;
I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; people had something
else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to my many
questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss
Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns’s shoulder,
my arms round her neck.&nbsp; I was asleep, and Helen
was—dead.</p>
<p>Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years
after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a
grey marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and
the word “Resurgam.”</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my
insignificant existence: to the first ten years of my life I have
given almost as many chapters.&nbsp; But this is not to be a
regular autobiography.&nbsp; I am only bound to invoke Memory
where I know her responses will possess some degree of interest;
therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence: a
few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
connection.</p>
<p>When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation
at Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its
virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public
attention on the school.&nbsp; Inquiry was made into the origin
of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which
excited public indignation in a high degree.&nbsp; The unhealthy
nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the
children’s food; the brackish, fetid water used in its
preparation; the pupils’ wretched clothing and
accommodations—all these things were discovered, and the
discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
beneficial to the institution.</p>
<p>Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county
subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building
in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in
diet and clothing introduced; the funds of the school were
intrusted to the management of a committee.&nbsp; Mr.
Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could
not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he
was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather
more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with
strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with
uprightness.&nbsp; The school, thus improved, became in time a
truly useful and noble institution.&nbsp; I remained an inmate of
its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil,
and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to
its value and importance.</p>
<p>During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy,
because it was not inactive.&nbsp; I had the means of an
excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some
of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with a
great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I
loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
offered me.&nbsp; In time I rose to be the first girl of the
first class; then I was invested with the office of teacher;
which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of
that time I altered.</p>
<p>Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued
superintendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the
best part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been
my continual solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother,
governess, and, latterly, companion.&nbsp; At this period she
married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man,
almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant county, and
consequently was lost to me.</p>
<p>From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was
gone every settled feeling, every association that had made
Lowood in some degree a home to me.&nbsp; I had imbibed from her
something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious
thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the
inmates of my mind.&nbsp; I had given in allegiance to duty and
order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and
subdued character.</p>
<p>But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came
between me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress
step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I
watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow;
and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude the
greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the
occasion.</p>
<p>I walked about the chamber most of the time.&nbsp; I imagined
myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair
it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and
found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced,
another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I
had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off
all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had
taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and
beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.&nbsp; It did not
seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were
gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me,
but the reason for tranquillity was no more.&nbsp; My world had
for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its
rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its
expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.</p>
<p>I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.&nbsp; There
were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there
were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon.&nbsp; My
eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the
blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their
boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
limits.&nbsp; I traced the white road winding round the base of
one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed
to follow it farther!&nbsp; I recalled the time when I had
travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that
hill at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day
which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it
since.&nbsp; My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her
family had ever been to visit me.&nbsp; I had had no
communication by letter or message with the outer world:
school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and
voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences,
and antipathies—such was what I knew of existence.&nbsp;
And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of
eight years in one afternoon.&nbsp; I desired liberty; for
liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed
scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.&nbsp; I abandoned it
and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that
petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space:
“Then,” I cried, half desperate, “grant me at
least a new servitude!”</p>
<p>Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me
downstairs.</p>
<p>I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my
reflections till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the
same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to
recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk.&nbsp; How I wished
sleep would silence her.&nbsp; It seemed as if, could I but go
back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the
window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.</p>
<p>Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and
till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me
in any other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the
first deep notes with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of
interruption; my half-effaced thought instantly revived.</p>
<p>“A new servitude!&nbsp; There is something in
that,” I soliloquised (mentally, be it understood; I did
not talk aloud), “I know there is, because it does not
sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than
sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste
of time to listen to them.&nbsp; But Servitude!&nbsp; That must
be matter of fact.&nbsp; Any one may serve: I have served here
eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere.&nbsp; Can I
not get so much of my own will?&nbsp; Is not the thing
feasible?&nbsp; Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult;
if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of
attaining it.”</p>
<p>I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a
chilly night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I
proceeded <i>to think</i> again with all my might.</p>
<p>“What do I want?&nbsp; A new place, in a new house,
amongst new faces, under new circumstances: I want this because
it is of no use wanting anything better.&nbsp; How do people do
to get a new place?&nbsp; They apply to friends, I suppose: I
have no friends.&nbsp; There are many others who have no friends,
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and
what is their resource?”</p>
<p>I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain
to find a response, and quickly.&nbsp; It worked and worked
faster: I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for
nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result came of its
efforts.&nbsp; Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a
turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.</p>
<p>A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required
suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and
naturally to my mind.—“Those who want situations
advertise; you must advertise in the <i>---shire
Herald</i>.”</p>
<p>“How?&nbsp; I know nothing about advertising.”</p>
<p>Replies rose smooth and prompt now:—</p>
<p>“You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay
for it under a cover directed to the editor of the <i>Herald</i>;
you must put it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at
Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-office
there; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your
letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.”</p>
<p>This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in
my mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied,
and fell asleep.</p>
<p>With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written,
enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school;
it ran thus:—</p>
<p>“A young lady accustomed to tuition” (had I not
been a teacher two years?) “is desirous of meeting with a
situation in a private family where the children are under
fourteen” (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not
do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age).&nbsp;
“She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music” (in
those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments,
would have been held tolerably comprehensive).&nbsp;
“Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---shire.”</p>
<p>This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea,
I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order
to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my
fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went.&nbsp; It
was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days
were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into
the post-office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming
garments, but with a relieved heart.</p>
<p>The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last,
however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the
close of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road
to Lowton.&nbsp; A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying
along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the
dale: but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or
might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound,
than of the charms of lea and water.</p>
<p>My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for
a pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it
was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from
the shoemaker’s to the post-office: it was kept by an old
dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on
her hands.</p>
<p>“Are there any letters for J.E.?” I asked.</p>
<p>She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a
drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long
that my hopes began to falter.&nbsp; At last, having held a
document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she
presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another
inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E.</p>
<p>“Is there only one?” I demanded.</p>
<p>“There are no more,” said she; and I put it in my
pocket and turned my face homeward: I could not open it then;
rules obliged me to be back by eight, and it was already
half-past seven.</p>
<p>Various duties awaited me on my arrival.&nbsp; I had to sit
with the girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to
read prayers; to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the
other teachers.&nbsp; Even when we finally retired for the night,
the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a
short end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she
should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the
heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she was
already snoring before I had finished undressing.&nbsp; There
still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the
seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.</p>
<p>“If J.E., who advertised in the <i>---shire Herald</i>
of last Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if
she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to
character and competency, a situation can be offered her where
there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age;
and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.&nbsp; J.E. is
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars
to the direction:—</p>
<p>“Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote,
---shire.”</p>
<p>I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned
and rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.&nbsp; This
circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me,
that in thus acting for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the
risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I wished
the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, <i>en
règle</i>.&nbsp; I now felt that an elderly lady was no
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.&nbsp; Mrs.
Fairfax!&nbsp; I saw her in a black gown and widow’s cap;
frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a model of elderly English
respectability.&nbsp; Thornfield! that, doubtless, was the name
of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I failed in
my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.&nbsp;
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of
England, yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.&nbsp;
---shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county
where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me.&nbsp; I
longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a
large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy place
enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
change at least.&nbsp; Not that my fancy was much captivated by
the idea of long chimneys and clouds of
smoke—“but,” I argued, “Thornfield will,
probably, be a good way from the town.”</p>
<p>Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went
out.</p>
<p>Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer
be confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to
achieve their success.&nbsp; Having sought and obtained an
audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation, I
told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the
salary would be double what I now received (for at Lowood I only
got £15 per annum); and requested she would break the
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as
references.&nbsp; She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in
the matter.&nbsp; The next day she laid the affair before Mr.
Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she
was my natural guardian.&nbsp; A note was accordingly addressed
to that lady, who returned for answer, that “I might do as
I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my
affairs.”&nbsp; This note went the round of the committee,
and at last, after what appeared to me most tedious delay, formal
leave was given me to better my condition if I could; and an
assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself well, both
as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and
capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
forthwith be furnished me.</p>
<p>This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month,
forwarded a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady’s
reply, stating that she was satisfied, and fixing that day
fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in
her house.</p>
<p>I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed
rapidly.&nbsp; I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was
adequate to my wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my
trunk,—the same I had brought with me eight years ago from
Gateshead.</p>
<p>The box was corded, the card nailed on.&nbsp; In half-an-hour
the carrier was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I
myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet
the coach.&nbsp; I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress,
prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my drawers to
see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more
to do, I sat down and tried to rest.&nbsp; I could not; though I
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I
was too much excited.&nbsp; A phase of my life was closing
to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in
the interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being
accomplished.</p>
<p>“Miss,” said a servant who met me in the lobby,
where I was wandering like a troubled spirit, “a person
below wishes to see you.”</p>
<p>“The carrier, no doubt,” I thought, and ran
downstairs without inquiry.&nbsp; I was passing the back-parlour
or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of which was half open,
to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—</p>
<p>“It’s her, I am sure!—I could have told her
anywhere!” cried the individual who stopped my progress and
took my hand.</p>
<p>I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant,
matronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and
eyes, and lively complexion.</p>
<p>“Well, who is it?” she asked, in a voice and with
a smile I half recognised; “you’ve not quite
forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?”</p>
<p>In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously:
“Bessie!&nbsp; Bessie!&nbsp; Bessie!” that was all I
said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both went into
the parlour.&nbsp; By the fire stood a little fellow of three
years old, in plaid frock and trousers.</p>
<p>“That is my little boy,” said Bessie directly.</p>
<p>“Then you are married, Bessie?”</p>
<p>“Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the
coachman; and I’ve a little girl besides Bobby there, that
I’ve christened Jane.”</p>
<p>“And you don’t live at Gateshead?”</p>
<p>“I live at the lodge: the old porter has
left.”</p>
<p>“Well, and how do they all get on?&nbsp; Tell me
everything about them, Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby,
come and sit on my knee, will you?” but Bobby preferred
sidling over to his mother.</p>
<p>“You’re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so
very stout,” continued Mrs. Leaven.&nbsp; “I dare say
they’ve not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the
head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would
make two of you in breadth.”</p>
<p>“Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?”</p>
<p>“Very.&nbsp; She went up to London last winter with her
mama, and there everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in
love with her: but his relations were against the match;
and—what do you think?—he and Miss Georgiana made it
up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.&nbsp; It was
Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now
she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are
always quarrelling—”</p>
<p>“Well, and what of John Reed?”</p>
<p>“Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could
wish.&nbsp; He went to college, and he got—plucked, I think
they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister,
and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they
will never make much of him, I think.”</p>
<p>“What does he look like?”</p>
<p>“He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking
young man; but he has such thick lips.”</p>
<p>“And Mrs. Reed?”</p>
<p>“Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I
think she’s not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s
conduct does not please her—he spends a deal of
money.”</p>
<p>“Did she send you here, Bessie?”</p>
<p>“No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when
I heard that there had been a letter from you, and that you were
going to another part of the country, I thought I’d just
set off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of my
reach.”</p>
<p>“I am afraid you are disappointed in me,
Bessie.”&nbsp; I said this laughing: I perceived that
Bessie’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
shape denote admiration.</p>
<p>“No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you
look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you:
you were no beauty as a child.”</p>
<p>I smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was
correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import:
at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that
they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings
anything but gratification.</p>
<p>“I dare say you are clever, though,” continued
Bessie, by way of solace.&nbsp; “What can you do?&nbsp; Can
you play on the piano?”</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then
asked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or
two, and she was charmed.</p>
<p>“The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said she
exultingly.&nbsp; “I always said you would surpass them in
learning: and can you draw?”</p>
<p>“That is one of my paintings over the
chimney-piece.”&nbsp; It was a landscape in water colours,
of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my
behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.</p>
<p>“Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!&nbsp; It is as fine
a picture as any Miss Reed’s drawing-master could paint,
let alone the young ladies themselves, who could not come near
it: and have you learnt French?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak
it.”</p>
<p>“And you can work on muslin and canvas?”</p>
<p>“I can.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!&nbsp; I knew you
would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or
not.&nbsp; There was something I wanted to ask you.&nbsp; Have
you ever heard anything from your father’s kinsfolk, the
Eyres?”</p>
<p>“Never in my life.”</p>
<p>“Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and
quite despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as
much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years
ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis
said you were at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much
disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to
a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day
or two.&nbsp; He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was
your father’s brother.”</p>
<p>“What foreign country was he going to,
Bessie?”</p>
<p>“An island thousands of miles off, where they make
wine—the butler did tell me—”</p>
<p>“Madeira?” I suggested.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is it—that is the very word.”</p>
<p>“So he went?”</p>
<p>“Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis
was very high with him; she called him afterwards a
‘sneaking tradesman.’&nbsp; My Robert believes he was
a wine-merchant.”</p>
<p>“Very likely,” I returned; “or perhaps clerk
or agent to a wine-merchant.”</p>
<p>Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and
then she was obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few
minutes the next morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the
coach.&nbsp; We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst
Arms there: each went her separate way; she set off for the brow
of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back
to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a
play; and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must
fancy you see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such
large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a
carpet, such furniture, such ornaments on the mantelpiece, such
prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of
the Prince of Wales, and a representation of the death of
Wolfe.&nbsp; All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire,
near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie
on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill
contracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an
October day: I left Lowton at four o’clock a.m., and the
Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.</p>
<p>Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very
tranquil in my mind.&nbsp; I thought when the coach stopped here
there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I
descended the wooden steps the “boots” placed for my
convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see
some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
Thornfield.&nbsp; Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I
asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre,
I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to
request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting,
while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my
thoughts.</p>
<p>It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel
itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every
connection, uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can
be reached, and prevented by many impediments from returning to
that it has quitted.&nbsp; The charm of adventure sweetens that
sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear
disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.&nbsp; I bethought
myself to ring the bell.</p>
<p>“Is there a place in this neighbourhood called
Thornfield?” I asked of the waiter who answered the
summons.</p>
<p>“Thornfield?&nbsp; I don’t know, ma’am;
I’ll inquire at the bar.”&nbsp; He vanished, but
reappeared instantly—</p>
<p>“Is your name Eyre, Miss?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Person here waiting for you.”</p>
<p>I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the
lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.</p>
<p>“This will be your luggage, I suppose?” said the
man rather abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the
passage.</p>
<p>“Yes.”&nbsp; He hoisted it on to the vehicle,
which was a sort of car, and then I got in; before he shut me up,
I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.</p>
<p>“A matter of six miles.”</p>
<p>“How long shall we be before we get there?”</p>
<p>“Happen an hour and a half.”</p>
<p>He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and
we set off.&nbsp; Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample
time to reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of
my journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not
elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.</p>
<p>“I suppose,” thought I, “judging from the
plainness of the servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very
dashing person: so much the better; I never lived amongst fine
people but once, and I was very miserable with them.&nbsp; I
wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on
with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one’s
best does not always answer.&nbsp; At Lowood, indeed, I took that
resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs.
Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn.&nbsp; I
pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if
she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to
the worst, I can advertise again.&nbsp; How far are we on our
road now, I wonder?”</p>
<p>I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us;
judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of
considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton.&nbsp; We were
now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were
houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a
different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more
stirring, less romantic.</p>
<p>The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his
horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I
verily believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and
said—</p>
<p>“You’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield
now.”</p>
<p>Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low
broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter;
I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a
village or hamlet.&nbsp; About ten minutes after, the driver got
down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they
clashed to behind us.&nbsp; We now slowly ascended a drive, and
came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one
curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.&nbsp; The car
stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I
alighted and went in.</p>
<p>“Will you walk this way, ma’am?” said the
girl; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all
round: she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of
fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with
the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when
I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
itself to my view.</p>
<p>A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an
arm-chair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest
imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk
gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied
Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking.&nbsp; She was
occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at her feet;
nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
domestic comfort.&nbsp; A more reassuring introduction for a new
governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to
overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered,
the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet
me.</p>
<p>“How do you do, my dear?&nbsp; I am afraid you have had
a tedious ride; John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to
the fire.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?” said I.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are right: do sit down.”</p>
<p>She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my
shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give
herself so much trouble.</p>
<p>“Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are
almost numbed with cold.&nbsp; Leah, make a little hot negus and
cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the
storeroom.”</p>
<p>And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of
keys, and delivered them to the servant.</p>
<p>“Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,” she
continued.&nbsp; “You’ve brought your luggage with
you, haven’t you, my dear?”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see it carried into your room,” she
said, and bustled out.</p>
<p>“She treats me like a visitor,” thought I.&nbsp;
“I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only
coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the
treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too
soon.”</p>
<p>She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting
apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the
tray which Leah now brought, and then herself handed me the
refreshments.&nbsp; I felt rather confused at being the object of
more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too,
shown by my employer and superior; but as she did not herself
seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place, I
thought it better to take her civilities quietly.</p>
<p>“Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax
to-night?” I asked, when I had partaken of what she offered
me.</p>
<p>“What did you say, my dear?&nbsp; I am a little
deaf,” returned the good lady, approaching her ear to my
mouth.</p>
<p>I repeated the question more distinctly.</p>
<p>“Miss Fairfax?&nbsp; Oh, you mean Miss Varens!&nbsp;
Varens is the name of your future pupil.”</p>
<p>“Indeed!&nbsp; Then she is not your daughter?”</p>
<p>“No,—I have no family.”</p>
<p>I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what
way Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was
not polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear
in time.</p>
<p>“I am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down
opposite to me, and took the cat on her knee; “I am so glad
you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a
companion.&nbsp; To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for
Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years
perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best
quarters.&nbsp; I say alone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure,
and John and his wife are very decent people; but then you see
they are only servants, and one can’t converse with them on
terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear
of losing one’s authority.&nbsp; I’m sure last winter
(it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not
snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and
postman came to the house, from November till February; and I
really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone;
I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don’t think
the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining.&nbsp;
In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days
make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of
this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child
makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be
quite gay.”</p>
<p>My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk;
and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my
sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she
anticipated.</p>
<p>“But I’ll not keep you sitting up late
to-night,” said she; “it is on the stroke of twelve
now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
tired.&nbsp; If you have got your feet well warmed, I’ll
show you your bedroom.&nbsp; I’ve had the room next to mine
prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you
would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be
sure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and
solitary, I never sleep in them myself.”</p>
<p>I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt
fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to
retire.&nbsp; She took her candle, and I followed her from the
room.&nbsp; First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened;
having taken the key from the lock, she led the way
upstairs.&nbsp; The steps and banisters were of oak; the
staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long
gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they
belonged to a church rather than a house.&nbsp; A very chill and
vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting
cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions,
and furnished in ordinary, modern style.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had
fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure
effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark
and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the
livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day
of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe
haven.&nbsp; The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart, and I
knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks
were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my
further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed
so frankly offered me before it was earned.&nbsp; My couch had no
thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears.&nbsp; At once
weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was
broad day.</p>
<p>The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun
shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing
papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and
stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the
view.&nbsp; Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought
that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to
have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and
toils.&nbsp; My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new
field offered to hope, seemed all astir.&nbsp; I cannot precisely
define what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not
perhaps that day or that month, but at an indefinite future
period.</p>
<p>I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be
plain—for I had no article of attire that was not made with
extreme simplicity—I was still by nature solicitous to be
neat.&nbsp; It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance
or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever
wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my
want of beauty would permit.&nbsp; I sometimes regretted that I
was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a
straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall,
stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune
that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and
so marked.&nbsp; And why had I these aspirations and these
regrets?&nbsp; It would be difficult to say: I could not then
distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical,
natural reason too.&nbsp; However, when I had brushed my hair
very smooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quakerlike as
it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and
adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably
enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would
not at least recoil from me with antipathy.&nbsp; Having opened
my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and
neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.</p>
<p>Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the
slippery steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a
minute; I looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember,
represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered
hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the
ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved,
and ebon black with time and rubbing.&nbsp; Everything appeared
very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
accustomed to grandeur.&nbsp; The hall-door, which was half of
glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold.&nbsp; It was a
fine autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned
groves and still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked
up and surveyed the front of the mansion.&nbsp; It was three
storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a
gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat:
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.&nbsp; Its
grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose
cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and
grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were
separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn
trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the
etymology of the mansion’s designation.&nbsp; Farther off
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy,
nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet
quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield
with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the
stirring locality of Millcote.&nbsp; A little hamlet, whose roofs
were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of these
hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its
old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and
gates.</p>
<p>I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air,
yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet
surveying the wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a
great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax
to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.</p>
<p>“What! out already?” said she.&nbsp; “I see
you are an early riser.”&nbsp; I went up to her, and was
received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.</p>
<p>“How do you like Thornfield?” she asked.&nbsp; I
told her I liked it very much.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “it is a pretty place; but
I fear it will be getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester
should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently;
or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine
grounds require the presence of the proprietor.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Rochester!” I exclaimed.&nbsp; “Who is
he?”</p>
<p>“The owner of Thornfield,” she responded
quietly.&nbsp; “Did you not know he was called
Rochester?”</p>
<p>Of course I did not—I had never heard of him before; but
the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally
understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by
instinct.</p>
<p>“I thought,” I continued, “Thornfield
belonged to you.”</p>
<p>“To me?&nbsp; Bless you, child; what an idea!&nbsp; To
me!&nbsp; I am only the housekeeper—the manager.&nbsp; To
be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the
mother’s side, or at least my husband was; he was a
clergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on
the hill—and that church near the gates was his.&nbsp; The
present Mr. Rochester’s mother was a Fairfax, and second
cousin to my husband: but I never presume on the
connection—in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself
quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is
always civil, and I expect nothing more.”</p>
<p>“And the little girl—my pupil!”</p>
<p>“She is Mr. Rochester’s ward; he commissioned me
to find a governess for her.&nbsp; He intended to have her
brought up in ---shire, I believe.&nbsp; Here she comes, with her
‘bonne,’ as she calls her nurse.”&nbsp; The
enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow was
no great dame; but a dependant like myself.&nbsp; I did not like
her the worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased
than ever.&nbsp; The equality between her and me was real; not
the mere result of condescension on her part: so much the
better—my position was all the freer.</p>
<p>As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed
by her attendant, came running up the lawn.&nbsp; I looked at my
pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a
child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a
pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair falling in
curls to her waist.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs.
Fairfax.&nbsp; “Come and speak to the lady who is to teach
you, and to make you a clever woman some day.”&nbsp; She
approached.</p>
<p>“C’est là ma gouverante!” said she,
pointing to me, and addressing her nurse; who answered—</p>
<p>“Mais oui, certainement.”</p>
<p>“Are they foreigners?” I inquired, amazed at
hearing the French language.</p>
<p>“The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the
Continent; and, I believe, never left it till within six months
ago.&nbsp; When she first came here she could speak no English;
now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don’t
understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make
out her meaning very well, I dare say.”</p>
<p>Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by
a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing
with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during
the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart
daily—applying myself to take pains with my accent, and
imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher,
I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with
Mademoiselle Adela.&nbsp; She came and shook hand with me when
she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to
breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she
replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table,
and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel
eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.</p>
<p>“Ah!” cried she, in French, “you speak my
language as well as Mr. Rochester does: I can talk to you as I
can to him, and so can Sophie.&nbsp; She will be glad: nobody
here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.&nbsp; Sophie
is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick,
and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester
lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie
and I had little beds in another place.&nbsp; I nearly fell out
of mine; it was like a shelf.&nbsp; And Mademoiselle—what
is your name?”</p>
<p>“Eyre—Jane Eyre.”</p>
<p>“Aire?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; I cannot say it.&nbsp; Well, our
ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a
great city—a huge city, with very dark houses and all
smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr.
Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and
Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to
a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an
hotel.&nbsp; We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to
walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the
Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond
with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.”</p>
<p>“Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?”
asked Mrs. Fairfax.</p>
<p>I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the
fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.</p>
<p>“I wish,” continued the good lady, “you
would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if
she remembers them?”</p>
<p>“Adèle,” I inquired, “with whom did
you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke
of?”</p>
<p>“I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy
Virgin.&nbsp; Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say
verses.&nbsp; A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama,
and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and
sing to them: I liked it.&nbsp; Shall I let you hear me sing
now?”</p>
<p>She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a
specimen of her accomplishments.&nbsp; Descending from her chair,
she came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little
hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her
eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some
opera.&nbsp; It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after
bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and
richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a
ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how
little his desertion has affected her.</p>
<p>The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but
I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of
love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very
bad taste that point was: at least I thought so.</p>
<p>Adèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with
the <i>naïveté</i> of her age.&nbsp; This achieved,
she jumped from my knee and said, “Now, Mademoiselle, I
will repeat you some poetry.”</p>
<p>Assuming an attitude, she began, “La Ligue des Rats:
fable de La Fontaine.”&nbsp; She then declaimed the little
piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis, a
flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very
unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
carefully trained.</p>
<p>“Was it your mama who taught you that piece?” I
asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, and she just used to say it in this way:
‘Qu’ avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats;
parlez!’&nbsp; She made me lift my hand—so—to
remind me to raise my voice at the question.&nbsp; Now shall I
dance for you?”</p>
<p>“No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy
Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?”</p>
<p>“With Madame Frédéric and her husband: she
took care of me, but she is nothing related to me.&nbsp; I think
she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama.&nbsp; I was
not long there.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to
go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
Rochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was
always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you
see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England,
and now he is gone back again himself, and I never see
him.”</p>
<p>After breakfast, Adèle and I withdrew to the library,
which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used
as the schoolroom.&nbsp; Most of the books were locked up behind
glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing
everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works,
and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography,
travels, a few romances, &amp;c.&nbsp; I suppose he had
considered that these were all the governess would require for
her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the
present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then
been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant
harvest of entertainment and information.&nbsp; In this room,
too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.</p>
<p>I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to
apply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any
kind.&nbsp; I felt it would be injudicious to confine her too
much at first; so, when I had talked to her a great deal, and got
her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon,
I allowed her to return to her nurse.&nbsp; I then proposed to
occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches
for her use.</p>
<p>As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils,
Mrs. Fairfax called to me: “Your morning school-hours are
over now, I suppose,” said she.&nbsp; She was in a room the
folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she addressed
me.&nbsp; It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs
and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly
moulded.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple
spar, which stood on a sideboard.</p>
<p>“What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked
round; for I had never before seen any half so imposing.</p>
<p>“Yes; this is the dining-room.&nbsp; I have just opened
the window, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything
gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the
drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.”</p>
<p>She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and
hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.&nbsp;
Mounting to it by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought
I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes
appeared the view beyond.&nbsp; Yet it was merely a very pretty
drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white
carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both
ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves,
beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and
ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were
of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows
large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.</p>
<p>“In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs.
Fairfax!” said I.&nbsp; “No dust, no canvas
coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
were inhabited daily.”</p>
<p>“Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits
here are rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I
observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up, and
to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best
to keep the rooms in readiness.”</p>
<p>“Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of
man?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman’s
tastes and habits, and he expects to have things managed in
conformity to them.”</p>
<p>“Do you like him?&nbsp; Is he generally
liked?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes; the family have always been respected
here.&nbsp; Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as
you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of
mind.”</p>
<p>“Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you
like him?&nbsp; Is he liked for himself?”</p>
<p>“I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I
believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his
tenants: but he has never lived much amongst them.”</p>
<p>“But has he no peculiarities?&nbsp; What, in short, is
his character?”</p>
<p>“Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.&nbsp; He
is rather peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and
seen a great deal of the world, I should think.&nbsp; I dare say
he is clever, but I never had much conversation with
him.”</p>
<p>“In what way is he peculiar?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know—it is not easy to
describe—nothing striking, but you feel it when he speaks
to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or
earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don’t
thoroughly understand him, in short—at least, I
don’t: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good
master.”</p>
<p>This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her
employer and mine.&nbsp; There are people who seem to have no
notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing
salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady
evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not
draw her out.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes;
a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more: she inquired
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to
gain a more definite notion of his identity.</p>
<p>When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the
rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs,
admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome.&nbsp;
The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of
the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting
from their air of antiquity.&nbsp; The furniture once
appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light
entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred
years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange
carvings of palm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of
the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow;
stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet
apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers
that for two generations had been coffin-dust.&nbsp; All these
relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of
a home of the past: a shrine of memory.&nbsp; I liked the hush,
the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by
no means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and
heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded,
others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds,
and strangest human beings,—all which would have looked
strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.</p>
<p>“Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I
asked.</p>
<p>“No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the
back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if
there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its
haunt.”</p>
<p>“So I think: you have no ghost, then?”</p>
<p>“None that I ever heard of,” returned Mrs.
Fairfax, smiling.</p>
<p>“Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost
stories?”</p>
<p>“I believe not.&nbsp; And yet it is said the Rochesters
have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time:
perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their
graves now.”</p>
<p>“Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever they
sleep well,’” I muttered.&nbsp; “Where are you
going now, Mrs. Fairfax?” for she was moving away.</p>
<p>“On to the leads; will you come and see the view from
thence?”&nbsp; I followed still, up a very narrow staircase
to the attics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to
the roof of the hall.&nbsp; I was now on a level with the crow
colony, and could see into their nests.&nbsp; Leaning over the
battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey
base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its
ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly
overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage;
the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all
reposing in the autumn day’s sun; the horizon bounded by a
propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.&nbsp; No
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was
pleasing.&nbsp; When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door,
I could scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed
black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I
had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture,
and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which
I had been gazing with delight.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door;
I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and
proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase.&nbsp; I
lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating the
front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim,
with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its
two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
Bluebeard’s castle.</p>
<p>While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in
so still a region, a laugh, struck my ear.&nbsp; It was a curious
laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless.&nbsp; I stopped: the sound
ceased, only for an instant; it began again, louder: for at
first, though distinct, it was very low.&nbsp; It passed off in a
clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely
chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have
pointed out the door whence the accents issued.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Fairfax!” I called out: for I now heard her
descending the great stairs.&nbsp; “Did you hear that loud
laugh?&nbsp; Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Some of the servants, very likely,” she answered:
“perhaps Grace Poole.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear it?” I again inquired.</p>
<p>“Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of
these rooms.&nbsp; Sometimes Leah is with her; they are
frequently noisy together.”</p>
<p>The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and
terminated in an odd murmur.</p>
<p>“Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.</p>
<p>I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was
as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but
that it was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness
accompanied the curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor
season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously
afraid.&nbsp; However, the event showed me I was a fool for
entertaining a sense even of surprise.</p>
<p>The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,—a
woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure,
red-haired, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less
romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.</p>
<p>“Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax.&nbsp;
“Remember directions!”&nbsp; Grace curtseyed silently
and went in.</p>
<p>“She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her
housemaid’s work,” continued the widow; “not
altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well
enough.&nbsp; By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil
this morning?”</p>
<p>The conversation, thus turned on Adèle, continued till
we reached the light and cheerful region below.&nbsp;
Adèle came running to meet us in the hall,
exclaiming—</p>
<p>“Mesdames, vous êtes servies!” adding,
“J’ai bien faim, moi!”</p>
<p>We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs.
Fairfax’s room.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm
introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied
on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates.&nbsp;
Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a
placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and
average intelligence.&nbsp; My pupil was a lively child, who had
been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward;
but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious
interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her
improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became
obedient and teachable.&nbsp; She had no great talents, no marked
traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste
which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood;
but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below
it.&nbsp; She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a
vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by
her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me,
in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both
content in each other’s society.</p>
<p>This, <i>par parenthèse</i>, will be thought cool
language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the
angelic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with
their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion: but
I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or
prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.&nbsp; I felt a
conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and
progress, and a quiet liking for her little self: just as I
cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness,
and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil
regard she had for me, and the moderation of her mind and
character.</p>
<p>Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now
and then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I
went down to the gates and looked through them along the road; or
when, while Adèle played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax
made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases,
raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads,
looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim
sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision which
might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,
towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never
seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than
I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance
with variety of character, than was here within my reach.&nbsp; I
valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in
Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other and more
vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to
behold.</p>
<p>Who blames me?&nbsp; Many, no doubt; and I shall be called
discontented.&nbsp; I could not help it: the restlessness was in
my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.&nbsp; Then my sole
relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey,
backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the
spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever bright
visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and
glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement,
which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life;
and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never
ended—a tale my imagination created, and narrated
continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.</p>
<p>It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if
they cannot find it.&nbsp; Millions are condemned to a stiller
doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their
lot.&nbsp; Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political
rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people
earth.&nbsp; Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their
faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their
brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute
a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is
narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say
that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering
bags.&nbsp; It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them,
if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced
necessary for their sex.</p>
<p>When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s
laugh: the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when
first heard, had thrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric
murmurs; stranger than her laugh.&nbsp; There were days when she
was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account
for the sounds she made.&nbsp; Sometimes I saw her: she would
come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her
hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh,
romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing
a pot of porter.&nbsp; Her appearance always acted as a damper to
the curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and
staid, she had no point to which interest could attach.&nbsp; I
made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but she seemed
a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
every effort of that sort.</p>
<p>The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife,
Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent
people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk
French, and sometimes I asked her questions about her native
country; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and
generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated
rather to check than encourage inquiry.</p>
<p>October, November, December passed away.&nbsp; One afternoon
in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle,
because she had a cold; and, as Adèle seconded the request
with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays
had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I
did well in showing pliability on the point.&nbsp; It was a fine,
calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just
written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my
bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the
distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon
walk.&nbsp; Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in her
little chair by Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour fireside, and given
her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver
paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of
amusement; and having replied to her “Revenez
bientôt, ma bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle.
Jeannette,” with a kiss I set out.</p>
<p>The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I
walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy
and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour
and situation.&nbsp; It was three o’clock; the church bell
tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in
its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming
sun.&nbsp; I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even
now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose
best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless
repose.&nbsp; If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here;
for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the
stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white,
worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.&nbsp; Far
and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle
now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred
occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that
had forgotten to drop.</p>
<p>This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached
the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a
field.&nbsp; Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering my
hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze
keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway,
where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
rapid thaw some days since.&nbsp; From my seat I could look down
on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal
object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose
against the west.&nbsp; I lingered till the sun went down amongst
the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them.&nbsp; I then
turned eastward.</p>
<p>On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a
cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which,
half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys:
it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear
plainly its thin murmurs of life.&nbsp; My ear, too, felt the
flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but
there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
threading their passes.&nbsp; That evening calm betrayed alike
the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most
remote.</p>
<p>A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at
once so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a
metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in
a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a
great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the
aërial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended
clouds where tint melts into tint.</p>
<p>The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings
of the lane yet hid it, but it approached.&nbsp; I was just
leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to
let it go by.&nbsp; In those days I was young, and all sorts of
fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery
stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred,
maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
childhood could give.&nbsp; As this horse approached, and as I
watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain
of Bessie’s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England
spirit called a “Gytrash,” which, in the form of
horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes
came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
me.</p>
<p>It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to
the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down
by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white
colour made him a distinct object against the trees.&nbsp; It was
exactly one form of Bessie’s Gytrash—a lion-like
creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine
eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.&nbsp; The horse
followed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider.&nbsp; The
man, the human being, broke the spell at once.&nbsp; Nothing ever
rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my
notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts,
could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.&nbsp;
No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut
to Millcote.&nbsp; He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I
turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of “What the
deuce is to do now?” and a clattering tumble, arrested my
attention.&nbsp; Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.&nbsp; The dog came
bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and
hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the
sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude.&nbsp; He
snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it
was all he could do,—there was no other help at hand to
summon.&nbsp; I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by
this time struggling himself free of his steed.&nbsp; His efforts
were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I
asked him the question—</p>
<p>“Are you injured, sir?”</p>
<p>I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was
pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me
directly.</p>
<p>“Can I do anything?” I asked again.</p>
<p>“You must just stand on one side,” he answered as
he rose, first to his knees, and then to his feet.&nbsp; I did;
whereupon began a heaving, stamping, clattering process,
accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually
some yards’ distance; but I would not be driven quite away
till I saw the event.&nbsp; This was finally fortunate; the horse
was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a “Down,
Pilot!”&nbsp; The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot
and leg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently
something ailed them, for he halted to the stile whence I had
just risen, and sat down.</p>
<p>I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I
think, for I now drew near him again.</p>
<p>“If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some
one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.”</p>
<p>“Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken
bones,—only a sprain;” and again he stood up and
tried his foot, but the result extorted an involuntary
“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing
bright: I could see him plainly.&nbsp; His figure was enveloped
in a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details
were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle
height and considerable breadth of chest.&nbsp; He had a dark
face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered
eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be
thirty-five.&nbsp; I felt no fear of him, and but little
shyness.&nbsp; Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young
gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him
against his will, and offering my services unasked.&nbsp; I had
hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to
one.&nbsp; I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty,
elegance, gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities
incarnate in masculine shape, I should have known instinctively
that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in
me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or
anything else that is bright but antipathetic.</p>
<p>If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me
when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance
gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt
any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of
the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he
waved to me to go, and announced—</p>
<p>“I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour,
in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your
horse.”</p>
<p>He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his
eyes in my direction before.</p>
<p>“I should think you ought to be at home yourself,”
said he, “if you have a home in this neighbourhood: where
do you come from?”</p>
<p>“From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being
out late when it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you
with pleasure, if you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a
letter.”</p>
<p>“You live just below—do you mean at that house
with the battlements?” pointing to Thornfield Hall, on
which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and
pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now
seemed one mass of shadow.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Whose house is it?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Rochester’s.”</p>
<p>“Do you know Mr. Rochester?”</p>
<p>“No, I have never seen him.”</p>
<p>“He is not resident, then?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me where he is?”</p>
<p>“I cannot.”</p>
<p>“You are not a servant at the hall, of course.&nbsp; You
are—”&nbsp; He stopped, ran his eye over my dress,
which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a black
beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for a
lady’s-maid.&nbsp; He seemed puzzled to decide what I was;
I helped him.</p>
<p>“I am the governess.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the governess!” he repeated; “deuce
take me, if I had not forgotten!&nbsp; The governess!” and
again my raiment underwent scrutiny.&nbsp; In two minutes he rose
from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to
move.</p>
<p>“I cannot commission you to fetch help,” he said;
“but you may help me a little yourself, if you will be so
kind.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“You have not an umbrella that I can use as a
stick?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Try to get hold of my horse’s bridle and lead him
to me: you are not afraid?”</p>
<p>I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but
when told to do it, I was disposed to obey.&nbsp; I put down my
muff on the stile, and went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured
to catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not
let me come near its head; I made effort on effort, though in
vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
fore-feet.&nbsp; The traveller waited and watched for some time,
and at last he laughed.</p>

</a></p>
<p>“I see,” he said, “the mountain will never
be brought to Mahomet, so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go
to the mountain; I must beg of you to come here.”</p>
<p>I came.&nbsp; “Excuse me,” he continued:
“necessity compels me to make you useful.”&nbsp; He
laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with some
stress, limped to his horse.&nbsp; Having once caught the bridle,
he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing
grimly as he made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.</p>
<p>“Now,” said he, releasing his under lip from a
hard bite, “just hand me my whip; it lies there under the
hedge.”</p>
<p>I sought it and found it.</p>
<p>“Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and
return as fast as you can.”</p>
<p>A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear,
and then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three
vanished,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Like heath that, in the wilderness,<br>
The wild wind whirls away.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took up my muff and walked on.&nbsp; The incident had
occurred and was gone for me: it <i>was</i> an incident of no
moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet it marked with
change one single hour of a monotonous life.&nbsp; My help had
been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was
yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all
passive.&nbsp; The new face, too, was like a new picture
introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all
the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and,
secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.&nbsp; I had it
still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into
the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way
home.&nbsp; When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked
round and listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might
ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a
Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw
only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still
and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest
waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a
mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the
murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light
kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I
hurried on.</p>
<p>I did not like re-entering Thornfield.&nbsp; To pass its
threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall,
to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little
room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long
winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the
faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip again over my
faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and
ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating.&nbsp; What good it
would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms
of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough
and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now
repined!&nbsp; Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired
of sitting still in a “too easy chair” to take a long
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my
circumstances, as it would be under his.</p>
<p>I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced
backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass
door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my
eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the
grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to
me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea
absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn
march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from
behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired
to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and
measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed
her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I
viewed them.&nbsp; Little things recall us to earth; the clock
struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars,
opened a side-door, and went in.</p>
<p>The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the
high-hung bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower
steps of the oak staircase.&nbsp; This ruddy shine issued from
the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and
showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and
brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished
furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.&nbsp; It revealed, too,
a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and
scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst
which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the
door closed.</p>
<p>I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire
there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.&nbsp; Instead, all
alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the
blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just
like the Gytrash of the lane.&nbsp; It was so like it that I went
forward and said—“Pilot” and the thing got up
and came to me and snuffed me.&nbsp; I caressed him, and he
wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be
alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come.&nbsp; I rang
the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an
account of this visitant.&nbsp; Leah entered.</p>
<p>“What dog is this?”</p>
<p>“He came with master.”</p>
<p>“With whom?”</p>
<p>“With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just
arrived.”</p>
<p>“Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the
dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had
an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained.”</p>
<p>“Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?”</p>
<p>“Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some
ice.”</p>
<p>“Ah!&nbsp; Bring me a candle will you Leah?”</p>
<p>Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who
repeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come,
and was now with Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give
orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went
to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morning.&nbsp;
When he did come down, it was to attend to business: his agent
and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with
him.</p>
<p>Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be
in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers.&nbsp; A
fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our
books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom.&nbsp; I
discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a
changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour
or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps,
too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it;
it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.</p>
<p>Adèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not
apply: she kept running to the door and looking over the
banisters to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester;
then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I
shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was
not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her sit
still, she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami,
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax <i>de</i> Rochester,” as she
dubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to
conjecture what presents he had brought her: for it appears he
had intimated the night before, that when his luggage came from
Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose
contents she had an interest.</p>
<p>“Et cela doit signifier,” said she,
“qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau pour moi, et
peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.&nbsp; Monsieur a
parlé de vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma
gouvernante, et si elle n’était pas une petite
personne, assez mince et un peu pâle.&nbsp; J’ai dit
qu’oui: car c’est vrai, n’est-ce pas,
mademoiselle?”</p>
<p>I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour;
the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the
schoolroom.&nbsp; At dark I allowed Adèle to put away
books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative
silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the
door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at
liberty.&nbsp; Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing
was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened
the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn.&nbsp; I let down
the curtain and went back to the fireside.</p>
<p>In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture
I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the
Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the
fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too
some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my
solitude.</p>
<p>“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would
take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening,” said
she: “he has been so much engaged all day that he could not
ask to see you before.”</p>
<p>“When is his tea-time?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the
country.&nbsp; You had better change your frock now; I will go
with you and fasten it.&nbsp; Here is a candle.”</p>
<p>“Is it necessary to change my frock?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening
when Mr. Rochester is here.”</p>
<p>This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I
repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced
my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only
additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my
Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn,
except on first-rate occasions.</p>
<p>“You want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax.&nbsp; I
had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a
parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went downstairs.&nbsp;
Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear
thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s presence.&nbsp; I
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her
shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose
curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.</p>
<p>Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the
mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay
Pilot—Adèle knelt near him.&nbsp; Half reclined on a
couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion;
he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire shone full
on his face.&nbsp; I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal
sweep of his black hair.&nbsp; I recognised his decisive nose,
more remarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils,
denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and
jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake.&nbsp;
His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure
in the athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin
flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.</p>
<p>Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs.
Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to
notice us, for he never lifted his head as we approached.</p>
<p>“Here is Miss Eyre, sir,” said Mrs. Fairfax, in
her quiet way.&nbsp; He bowed, still not taking his eyes from the
group of the dog and child.</p>
<p>“Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said he: and there was
something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal
tone, which seemed further to express, “What the deuce is
it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?&nbsp; At this moment
I am not disposed to accost her.”</p>
<p>I sat down quite disembarrassed.&nbsp; A reception of finished
politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have
returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part;
but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a
decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the
advantage.&nbsp; Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was
piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.</p>
<p>He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor
moved.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some
one should be amiable, and she began to talk.&nbsp; Kindly, as
usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she condoled with
him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then
she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with
it.</p>
<p>“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole
rejoinder she got.&nbsp; She hastened to ring the bell; and when
the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons,
&amp;c., with assiduous celerity.&nbsp; I and Adèle went
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.</p>
<p>“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said
Mrs. Fairfax to me; “Adèle might perhaps spill
it.”</p>
<p>I did as requested.&nbsp; As he took the cup from my hand,
Adèle, thinking the moment propitious for making a request
in my favour, cried out—</p>
<p>“N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau
pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?”</p>
<p>“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly.&nbsp;
“Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; Are you fond of
presents?” and he searched my face with eyes that I saw
were dark, irate, and piercing.</p>
<p>“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them:
they are generally thought pleasant things.”</p>
<p>“Generally thought?&nbsp; But what do <i>you</i>
think?”</p>
<p>“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could
give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many
faces to it, has it not? and one should consider all, before
pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.”</p>
<p>“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as
Adèle: she demands a ‘cadeau,’ clamorously,
the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.”</p>
<p>“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than
Adèle has: she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance,
and the right too of custom; for she says you have always been in
the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make out a
case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done
nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty!&nbsp; I have
examined Adèle, and find you have taken great pains with
her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a short time
she has made much improvement.”</p>
<p>“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I
am obliged to you: it is the meed teachers most
covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.”</p>
<p>“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea
in silence.</p>
<p>“Come to the fire,” said the master, when the tray
was taken away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with
her knitting; while Adèle was leading me by the hand round
the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the
consoles and chiffonnières.&nbsp; We obeyed, as in duty
bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was
ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.</p>
<p>“You have been resident in my house three
months?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“And you came from—?”</p>
<p>“From Lowood school, in ---shire.”</p>
<p>“Ah! a charitable concern.&nbsp; How long were you
there?”</p>
<p>“Eight years.”</p>
<p>“Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.&nbsp; I
thought half the time in such a place would have done up any
constitution!&nbsp; No wonder you have rather the look of another
world.&nbsp; I marvelled where you had got that sort of
face.&nbsp; When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand
whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.&nbsp; Who
are your parents?”</p>
<p>“I have none.”</p>
<p>“Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember
them?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I thought not.&nbsp; And so you were waiting for your
people when you sat on that stile?”</p>
<p>“For whom, sir?”</p>
<p>“For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening
for them.&nbsp; Did I break through one of your rings, that you
spread that damned ice on the causeway?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.&nbsp; “The men in green all forsook
England a hundred years ago,” said I, speaking as seriously
as he had done.&nbsp; “And not even in Hay Lane, or the
fields about it, could you find a trace of them.&nbsp; I
don’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will
ever shine on their revels more.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised
eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.</p>
<p>“Well,” resumed Mr. Rochester, “if you
disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and
aunts?”</p>
<p>“No; none that I ever saw.”</p>
<p>“And your home?”</p>
<p>“I have none.”</p>
<p>“Where do your brothers and sisters live?”</p>
<p>“I have no brothers or sisters.”</p>
<p>“Who recommended you to come here?”</p>
<p>“I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my
advertisement.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what
ground we were upon, “and I am daily thankful for the
choice Providence led me to make.&nbsp; Miss Eyre has been an
invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
Adèle.”</p>
<p>“Don’t trouble yourself to give her a
character,” returned Mr. Rochester: “eulogiums will
not bias me; I shall judge for myself.&nbsp; She began by felling
my horse.”</p>
<p>“Sir?” said Mrs. Fairfax.</p>
<p>“I have to thank her for this sprain.”</p>
<p>The widow looked bewildered.</p>
<p>“Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Have you seen much society?”</p>
<p>“None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the
inmates of Thornfield.”</p>
<p>“Have you read much?”</p>
<p>“Only such books as came in my way; and they have not
been numerous or very learned.”</p>
<p>“You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well
drilled in religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand
directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent
full of religieuses would worship their director.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no.”</p>
<p>“You are very cool!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; What! a novice not
worship her priest!&nbsp; That sounds blasphemous.”</p>
<p>“I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the
feeling.&nbsp; He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling;
he cut off our hair; and for economy’s sake bought us bad
needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew.”</p>
<p>“That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs.
Fairfax, who now again caught the drift of the dialogue.</p>
<p>“And was that the head and front of his
offending?” demanded Mr. Rochester.</p>
<p>“He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of
the provision department, before the committee was appointed; and
he bored us with long lectures once a week, and with evening
readings from books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and
judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.”</p>
<p>“What age were you when you went to Lowood?”</p>
<p>“About ten.”</p>
<p>“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then,
eighteen?”</p>
<p>I assented.</p>
<p>“Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I
should hardly have been able to guess your age.&nbsp; It is a
point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so
much at variance as in your case.&nbsp; And now what did you
learn at Lowood?&nbsp; Can you play?”</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>“Of course: that is the established answer.&nbsp; Go
into the library—I mean, if you please.—(Excuse my
tone of command; I am used to say, ‘Do this,’ and it
is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with
you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a
tune.”</p>
<p>I departed, obeying his directions.</p>
<p>“Enough!” he called out in a few minutes.&nbsp;
“You play <i>a little</i>, I see; like any other English
school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not
well.”</p>
<p>I closed the piano and returned.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester
continued—“Adèle showed me some sketches this
morning, which she said were yours.&nbsp; I don’t know
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided
you?”</p>
<p>“No, indeed!” I interjected.</p>
<p>“Ah! that pricks pride.&nbsp; Well, fetch me your
portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original; but
don’t pass your word unless you are certain: I can
recognise patchwork.”</p>
<p>“Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for
yourself, sir.”</p>
<p>I brought the portfolio from the library.</p>
<p>“Approach the table,” said he; and I wheeled it to
his couch.&nbsp; Adèle and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see
the pictures.</p>
<p>“No crowding,” said Mr. Rochester: “take the
drawings from my hand as I finish with them; but don’t push
your faces up to mine.”</p>
<p>He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.&nbsp;
Three he laid aside; the others, when he had examined them, he
swept from him.</p>
<p>“Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,”
said he, “and look at them with
Adèle;—you” (glancing at me) “resume
your seat, and answer my questions.&nbsp; I perceive those
pictures were done by one hand: was that hand yours?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And when did you find time to do them?&nbsp; They have
taken much time, and some thought.”</p>
<p>“I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood,
when I had no other occupation.”</p>
<p>“Where did you get your copies?”</p>
<p>“Out of my head.”</p>
<p>“That head I see now on your shoulders?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Has it other furniture of the same kind
within?”</p>
<p>“I should think it may have: I should
hope—better.”</p>
<p>He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them
alternately.</p>
<p>While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they
are: and first, I must premise that they are nothing
wonderful.&nbsp; The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my
mind.&nbsp; As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I
attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a
pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.</p>
<p>These pictures were in water-colours.&nbsp; The first
represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all
the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or
rather, the nearest billows, for there was no land.&nbsp; One
gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which
sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam;
its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as
glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.&nbsp; Sinking
below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the
green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence
the bracelet had been washed or torn.</p>
<p>The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak
of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a
breeze.&nbsp; Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark
blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman’s
shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could
combine.&nbsp; The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the
lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour;
the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a
beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.&nbsp; On the
neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre
touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this
vision of the Evening Star.</p>
<p>The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar
winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances,
close serried, along the horizon.&nbsp; Throwing these into
distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,—a colossal head,
inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it.&nbsp; Two
thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up
before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless,
white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but
for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible.&nbsp; Above
the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague
in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of
white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.&nbsp;
This pale crescent was “the likeness of a kingly
crown;” what it diademed was “the shape which shape
had none.”</p>
<p>“Were you happy when you painted these pictures?”
asked Mr. Rochester presently.</p>
<p>“I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.&nbsp; To
paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I
have ever known.”</p>
<p>“That is not saying much.&nbsp; Your pleasures, by your
own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind
of artist’s dreamland while you blent and arranged these
strange tints.&nbsp; Did you sit at them long each
day?”</p>
<p>“I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation,
and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till
night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination
to apply.”</p>
<p>“And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your
ardent labours?”</p>
<p>“Far from it.&nbsp; I was tormented by the contrast
between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined
something which I was quite powerless to realise.”</p>
<p>“Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought;
but no more, probably.&nbsp; You had not enough of the
artist’s skill and science to give it full being: yet the
drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.&nbsp; As to the
thoughts, they are elfish.&nbsp; These eyes in the Evening Star
you must have seen in a dream.&nbsp; How could you make them look
so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above
quells their rays.&nbsp; And what meaning is that in their solemn
depth?&nbsp; And who taught you to paint wind?&nbsp; There is a
high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.&nbsp; Where did you
see Latmos?&nbsp; For that is Latmos.&nbsp; There! put the
drawings away!”</p>
<p>I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking
at his watch, he said abruptly—</p>
<p>“It is nine o’clock: what are you about, Miss
Eyre, to let Adèle sit up so long?&nbsp; Take her to
bed.”</p>
<p>Adèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he
endured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than
Pilot would have done, nor so much.</p>
<p>“I wish you all good-night, now,” said he, making
a movement of the hand towards the door, in token that he was
tired of our company, and wished to dismiss us.&nbsp; Mrs.
Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed
to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.</p>
<p>“You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar,
Mrs. Fairfax,” I observed, when I rejoined her in her room,
after putting Adèle to bed.</p>
<p>“Well, is he?”</p>
<p>“I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.”</p>
<p>“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am
so accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he
has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none
of us help our nature; and partly because he has painful
thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his spirits
unequal.”</p>
<p>“What about?”</p>
<p>“Family troubles, for one thing.”</p>
<p>“But he has no family.”</p>
<p>“Not now, but he has had—or, at least,
relatives.&nbsp; He lost his elder brother a few years
since.”</p>
<p>“His <i>elder</i> brother?”</p>
<p>“Yes.&nbsp; The present Mr. Rochester has not been very
long in possession of the property; only about nine
years.”</p>
<p>“Nine years is a tolerable time.&nbsp; Was he so very
fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his
loss?”</p>
<p>“Why, no—perhaps not.&nbsp; I believe there were
some misunderstandings between them.&nbsp; Mr. Rowland Rochester
was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his
father against him.&nbsp; The old gentleman was fond of money,
and anxious to keep the family estate together.&nbsp; He did not
like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the
consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some
steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal
of mischief.&nbsp; Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to
bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for
the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that
position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook
what he had to suffer in it.&nbsp; He is not very forgiving: he
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an
unsettled kind of life.&nbsp; I don’t think he has ever
been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the
death of his brother without a will left him master of the
estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.”</p>
<p>“Why should he shun it?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.”</p>
<p>The answer was evasive.&nbsp; I should have liked something
clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me
more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr.
Rochester’s trials.&nbsp; She averred they were a mystery
to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
conjecture.&nbsp; It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to
drop the subject, which I did accordingly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr.
Rochester.&nbsp; In the mornings he seemed much engaged with
business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the
neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with
him.&nbsp; When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these
visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.</p>
<p>During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to
his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an
occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the
gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly,
just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance,
and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.&nbsp;
His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had
nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended
on causes quite disconnected with me.</p>
<p>One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my
portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the
gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at
Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet
and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.&nbsp; Soon
after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
Adèle were to go downstairs.&nbsp; I brushed
Adèle’s hair and made her neat, and having
ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and plain,
braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we
descended, Adèle wondering whether the <i>petit coffre</i>
was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had
hitherto been delayed.&nbsp; She was gratified: there it stood, a
little carton, on the table when we entered the
dining-room.&nbsp; She appeared to know it by instinct.</p>
<p>“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running
towards it.</p>
<p>“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it
into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself
with disembowelling it,” said the deep and rather sarcastic
voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense
easy-chair at the fireside.&nbsp; “And mind,” he
continued, “don’t bother me with any details of the
anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the
entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi
tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”</p>
<p>Adèle seemed scarcely to need the warning—she had
already retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying
the cord which secured the lid.&nbsp; Having removed this
impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper,
she merely exclaimed—</p>
<p>“Oh ciel!&nbsp; Que c’est beau!” and then
remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation.</p>
<p>“Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master,
half rising from his seat to look round to the door, near which I
still stood.</p>
<p>“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.”&nbsp; He
drew a chair near his own.&nbsp; “I am not fond of the
prattle of children,” he continued; “for, old
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with
their lisp.&nbsp; It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole
evening <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a brat.&nbsp;
Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down
exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is.&nbsp;
Confound these civilities!&nbsp; I continually forget them.&nbsp;
Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies.&nbsp;
By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won’t do to
neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said
to be thicker than water.”</p>
<p>He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who
soon arrived, knitting-basket in hand.</p>
<p>“Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable
purpose.&nbsp; I have forbidden Adèle to talk to me about
her presents, and she is bursting with repletion: have the
goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be
one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed.”</p>
<p>Adèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she
summoned her to her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with
the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contents of her
“boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations and
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.</p>
<p>“Now I have performed the part of a good host,”
pursued Mr. Rochester, “put my guests into the way of
amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own
pleasure.&nbsp; Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther
forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you without
disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
mind to do.”</p>
<p>I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained
somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of
giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him
promptly.</p>
<p>We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which
had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of
light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains
hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch;
everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adèle (she
dared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of
winter rain against the panes.</p>
<p>Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked
different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so
stern—much less gloomy.&nbsp; There was a smile on his
lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not
sure; but I think it very probable.&nbsp; He was, in short, in
his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more
self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning;
still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head
against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light
of the fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark
eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes,
too—not without a certain change in their depths sometimes,
which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
feeling.</p>
<p>He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been
looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly,
he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.</p>
<p>“You examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he: “do
you think me handsome?”</p>
<p>I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question
by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer
somehow slipped from my tongue before I was
aware—“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Ah!&nbsp; By my word! there is something singular about
you,” said he: “you have the air of a little
<i>nonnette</i>; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit
with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to
my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a
question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply,
you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least
brusque.&nbsp; What do you mean by it?”</p>
<p>“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I ought
to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer
to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and
that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that
sort.”</p>
<p>“You ought to have replied no such thing.&nbsp; Beauty
of little consequence, indeed!&nbsp; And so, under pretence of
softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into
placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear!&nbsp; Go on:
what fault do you find with me, pray?&nbsp; I suppose I have all
my limbs and all my features like any other man?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I
intended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.”</p>
<p>“Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for
it.&nbsp; Criticise me: does my forehead not please
you?”</p>
<p>He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally
over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual
organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of
benevolence should have risen.</p>
<p>“Now, ma’am, am I a fool?”</p>
<p>“Far from it, sir.&nbsp; You would, perhaps, think me
rude if I inquired in return whether you are a
philanthropist?”</p>
<p>“There again!&nbsp; Another stick of the penknife, when
she pretended to pat my head: and that is because I said I did
not like the society of children and old women (low be it
spoken!).&nbsp; No, young lady, I am not a general
philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;” and he pointed to
the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and
which, fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous;
giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head:
“and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of
heart.&nbsp; When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow
enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but
Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with
her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an
India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two
still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the
lump.&nbsp; Yes: does that leave hope for me?”</p>
<p>“Hope of what, sir?”</p>
<p>“Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to
flesh?”</p>
<p>“Decidedly he has had too much wine,” I thought;
and I did not know what answer to make to his queer question: how
could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed?</p>
<p>“You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you
are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air
becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those
searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them
with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on.&nbsp; Young
lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
to-night.”</p>
<p>With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood,
leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his
shape was seen plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth
of chest, disproportionate almost to his length of limb.&nbsp; I
am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there
was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his
demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of
mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one
inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind,
imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.</p>
<p>“I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
to-night,” he repeated, “and that is why I sent for
you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for
me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk.&nbsp;
Adèle is a degree better, but still far below the mark;
Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will:
you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.&nbsp; I
have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours
from my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to
dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases.&nbsp; It would
please me now to draw you out—to learn more of
you—therefore speak.”</p>
<p>Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or
submissive smile either.</p>
<p>“Speak,” he urged.</p>
<p>“What about, sir?”</p>
<p>“Whatever you like.&nbsp; I leave both the choice of
subject and the manner of treating it entirely to
yourself.”</p>
<p>Accordingly I sat and said nothing: “If he expects me to
talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find
he has addressed himself to the wrong person,” I
thought.</p>
<p>“You are dumb, Miss Eyre.”</p>
<p>I was dumb still.&nbsp; He bent his head a little towards me,
and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.</p>
<p>“Stubborn?” he said, “and annoyed.&nbsp; Ah!
it is consistent.&nbsp; I put my request in an absurd, almost
insolent form.&nbsp; Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon.&nbsp; The fact
is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an
inferior: that is” (correcting himself), “I claim
only such superiority as must result from twenty years’
difference in age and a century’s advance in
experience.&nbsp; This is legitimate, <i>et j’y tiens</i>,
as Adèle would say; and it is by virtue of this
superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the
goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts,
which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a
rusty nail.”</p>
<p>He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did
not feel insensible to his condescension, and would not seem
so.</p>
<p>“I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite
willing; but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know
what will interest you?&nbsp; Ask me questions, and I will do my
best to answer them.”</p>
<p>“Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I
have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting,
sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough
to be your father, and that I have battled through a varied
experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half
the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in
one house?”</p>
<p>“Do as you please, sir.”</p>
<p>“That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating,
because a very evasive one.&nbsp; Reply clearly.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command
me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen
more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends
on the use you have made of your time and experience.”</p>
<p>“Humph!&nbsp; Promptly spoken.&nbsp; But I won’t
allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have
made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both
advantages.&nbsp; Leaving superiority out of the question, then,
you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without
being piqued or hurt by the tone of command.&nbsp; Will
you?”</p>
<p>I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester <i>is</i>
peculiar—he seems to forget that he pays me £30 per
annum for receiving his orders.</p>
<p>“The smile is very well,” said he, catching
instantly the passing expression; “but speak
too.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would
trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid
subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders.”</p>
<p>“Paid subordinates!&nbsp; What! you are my paid
subordinate, are you?&nbsp; Oh yes, I had forgotten the
salary!&nbsp; Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree
to let me hector a little?”</p>
<p>“No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that
you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent
is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily.”</p>
<p>“And will you consent to dispense with a great many
conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the
omission arises from insolence?”</p>
<p>“I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for
insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would
submit to, even for a salary.”</p>
<p>“Humbug!&nbsp; Most things free-born will submit to
anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and
don’t venture on generalities of which you are intensely
ignorant.&nbsp; However, I mentally shake hands with you for your
answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in
which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner
was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no,
on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid,
coarse-minded misapprehension of one’s meaning are the
usual rewards of candour.&nbsp; Not three in three thousand raw
school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just
done.&nbsp; But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are
cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of
yours: Nature did it.&nbsp; And then, after all, I go too fast in
my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no better than
the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your
few good points.”</p>
<p>“And so may you,” I thought.&nbsp; My eye met his
as the idea crossed my mind: he seemed to read the glance,
answering as if its import had been spoken as well as
imagined—</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, you are right,” said he; “I have
plenty of faults of my own: I know it, and I don’t wish to
palliate them, I assure you.&nbsp; God wot I need not be too
severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of deeds,
a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to
myself.&nbsp; I started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I
like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse
circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of
one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right course since:
but I might have been very different; I might have been as good
as you—wiser—almost as stainless.&nbsp; I envy you
your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted
memory.&nbsp; Little girl, a memory without blot or contamination
must be an exquisite treasure—an inexhaustible source of
pure refreshment: is it not?”</p>
<p>“How was your memory when you were eighteen,
sir?”</p>
<p>“All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge
water had turned it to fetid puddle.&nbsp; I was your equal at
eighteen—quite your equal.&nbsp; Nature meant me to be, on
the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you
see I am not so.&nbsp; You would say you don’t see it; at
least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware,
by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at
interpreting its language).&nbsp; Then take my word for
it,—I am not a villain: you are not to suppose
that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but,
owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my
natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all
the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try
to put on life.&nbsp; Do you wonder that I avow this to
you?&nbsp; Know, that in the course of your future life you will
often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your
acquaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find out,
as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself,
but to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel,
too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less
comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its
manifestations.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?—how can you guess all this,
sir?”</p>
<p>“I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as
if I were writing my thoughts in a diary.&nbsp; You would say, I
should have been superior to circumstances; so I should—so
I should; but you see I was not.&nbsp; When fate wronged me, I
had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I
degenerated.&nbsp; Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my
disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a
level.&nbsp; I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do!&nbsp;
Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is
the poison of life.”</p>
<p>“Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.”</p>
<p>“It is not its cure.&nbsp; Reformation may be its cure;
and I could reform—I have strength yet for
that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it,
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?&nbsp; Besides, since
happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get
pleasure out of life: and I <i>will</i> get it, cost what it
may.”</p>
<p>“Then you will degenerate still more, sir.”</p>
<p>“Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh
pleasure?&nbsp; And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild
honey the bee gathers on the moor.”</p>
<p>“It will sting—it will taste bitter,
sir.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?—you never tried it.&nbsp; How
very serious—how very solemn you look: and you are as
ignorant of the matter as this cameo head” (taking one from
the mantelpiece).&nbsp; “You have no right to preach to me,
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are
absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.”</p>
<p>“I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said
error brought remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of
existence.”</p>
<p>“And who talks of error now?&nbsp; I scarcely think the
notion that flittered across my brain was an error.&nbsp; I
believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation: it was
very genial, very soothing—I know that.&nbsp; Here it comes
again!&nbsp; It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has
put on the robes of an angel of light.&nbsp; I think I must admit
so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart.”</p>
<p>“Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.”</p>
<p>“Once more, how do you know?&nbsp; By what instinct do
you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss
and a messenger from the eternal throne—between a guide and
a seducer?”</p>
<p>“I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled
when you said the suggestion had returned upon you.&nbsp; I feel
sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it.”</p>
<p>“Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in
the world: for the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so
don’t make yourself uneasy.&nbsp; Here, come in, bonny
wanderer!”</p>
<p>He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye
but his own; then, folding his arms, which he had half extended,
on his chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible
being.</p>
<p>“Now,” he continued, again addressing me, “I
have received the pilgrim—a disguised deity, as I verily
believe.&nbsp; Already it has done me good: my heart was a sort
of charnel; it will now be a shrine.”</p>
<p>“To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at
all: I cannot keep up the conversation, because it has got out of
my depth.&nbsp; Only one thing, I know: you said you were not as
good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own
imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you intimated
that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.&nbsp; It
seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it
possible to become what you yourself would approve; and that if
from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts
and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and
stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with
pleasure.”</p>
<p>“Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this
moment, I am paving hell with energy.”</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>“I am laying down good intentions, which I believe
durable as flint.&nbsp; Certainly, my associates and pursuits
shall be other than they have been.”</p>
<p>“And better?”</p>
<p>“And better—so much better as pure ore is than
foul dross.&nbsp; You seem to doubt me; I don’t doubt
myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this
moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and
Persians, that both are right.”</p>
<p>“They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to
legalise them.”</p>
<p>“They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a
new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand
unheard-of rules.”</p>
<p>“That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see
at once that it is liable to abuse.”</p>
<p>“Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household
gods not to abuse it.”</p>
<p>“You are human and fallible.”</p>
<p>“I am: so are you—what then?”</p>
<p>“The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with
which the divine and perfect alone can be safely
intrusted.”</p>
<p>“What power?”</p>
<p>“That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of
action,—‘Let it be right.’”</p>
<p>“‘Let it be right’—the very words: you
have pronounced them.”</p>
<p>“<i>May</i> it be right then,” I said, as I rose,
deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness
to me; and, besides, sensible that the character of my
interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at least, beyond its
present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of
insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“To put Adèle to bed: it is past her
bedtime.”</p>
<p>“You are afraid of me, because I talk like a
Sphynx.”</p>
<p>“Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am
bewildered, I am certainly not afraid.”</p>
<p>“You <i>are</i> afraid—your self-love dreads a
blunder.”</p>
<p>“In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no
wish to talk nonsense.”</p>
<p>“If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner,
I should mistake it for sense.&nbsp; Do you never laugh, Miss
Eyre?&nbsp; Don’t trouble yourself to answer—I see
you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you
are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally
vicious.&nbsp; The Lowood constraint still clings to you
somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and
restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and
a brother—or father, or master, or what you will—to
smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and
movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare
offer now.&nbsp; I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort
of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless,
resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar
cloud-high.&nbsp; You are still bent on going?”</p>
<p>“It has struck nine, sir.”</p>
<p>“Never mind,—wait a minute: Adèle is not
ready to go to bed yet.&nbsp; My position, Miss Eyre, with my
back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours
observation.&nbsp; While talking to you, I have also occasionally
watched Adèle (I have my own reasons for thinking her a
curious study,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall,
impart to you some day).&nbsp; She pulled out of her box, about
ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face
as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her
brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.&nbsp; ‘Il faut
que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et à
l’instant même!’ and she rushed out of the
room.&nbsp; She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process:
in a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall
see,—a miniature of Céline Varens, as she used to
appear on the boards at the rising of—But never mind
that.&nbsp; However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a
shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will
be realised.”</p>
<p>Ere long, Adèle’s little foot was heard tripping
across the hall.&nbsp; She entered, transformed as her guardian
had predicted.&nbsp; A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short,
and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the
brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled
her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small
white satin sandals.</p>
<p>“Est-ce que ma robe va bien?” cried she, bounding
forwards; “et mes souliers? et mes bas?&nbsp; Tenez, je
crois que je vais danser!”</p>
<p>And spreading out her dress, she chasséed across the
room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly
round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his
feet, exclaiming—</p>
<p>“Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre
bonté;” then rising, she added, “C’est
comme cela que maman faisait, n’est-ce pas,
monsieur?”</p>
<p>“Pre-cise-ly!” was the answer; “and,
‘comme cela,’ she charmed my English gold out of my
British breeches’ pocket.&nbsp; I have been green, too,
Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens
you now than once freshened me.&nbsp; My Spring is gone, however,
but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in
some moods, I would fain be rid of.&nbsp; Not valuing now the
root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort which
nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to
the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just
now.&nbsp; I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic
principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good
work.&nbsp; I’ll explain all this some day.&nbsp;
Good-night.”</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.&nbsp; It
was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in
the grounds: and while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock,
he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight
of her.</p>
<p>He then said that she was the daughter of a French
opera-dancer, Céline Varens, towards whom he had once
cherished what he called a “<i>grande
passion</i>.”&nbsp; This passion Céline had
professed to return with even superior ardour.&nbsp; He thought
himself her idol, ugly as he was: he believed, as he said, that
she preferred his “<i>taille
d’athlète</i>” to the elegance of the Apollo
Belvidere.</p>
<p>“And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this
preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I
installed her in an hotel; gave her a complete establishment of
servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles,
&amp;c.&nbsp; In short, I began the process of ruining myself in
the received style, like any other spoony.&nbsp; I had not, it
seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and
destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to
deviate an inch from the beaten centre.&nbsp; I had—as I
deserved to have—the fate of all other spoonies.&nbsp;
Happening to call one evening when Céline did not expect
me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired
with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy
to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.&nbsp;
No,—I exaggerate; I never thought there was any
consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille
perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of
sanctity.&nbsp; I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought
myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony.&nbsp;
It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and
serene.&nbsp; The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I
sat down, and took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you
will excuse me.”</p>
<p>Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting
of a cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of
Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air, he went
on—</p>
<p>“I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
<i>croquant</i>—(overlook the
barbarism)—<i>croquant</i> chocolate comfits, and smoking
alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house,
when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of
English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night,
I recognised the ‘voiture’ I had given
Céline.&nbsp; She was returning: of course my heart
thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant
upon.&nbsp; The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel
door; my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata)
alighted: though muffed in a cloak—an unnecessary
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening—I knew
her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of
her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step.&nbsp; Bending
over the balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon
ange’—in a tone, of course, which should be audible
to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped from the
carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel
which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which
now passed under the arched <i>porte cochère</i> of the
hotel.</p>
<p>“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?&nbsp; Of
course not: I need not ask you; because you never felt
love.&nbsp; You have both sentiments yet to experience: your soul
sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it.&nbsp;
You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
which your youth has hitherto slid away.&nbsp; Floating on with
closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling
not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil
at their base.&nbsp; But I tell you—and you may mark my
words—you will come some day to a craggy pass in the
channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up
into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed
to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some
master-wave into a calmer current—as I am now.</p>
<p>“I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the
sternness and stillness of the world under this frost.&nbsp; I
like Thornfield, its antiquity, its retirement, its old
crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey façade, and lines of
dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have
I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
plague-house?&nbsp; How I do still abhor—”</p>
<p>He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and
struck his boot against the hard ground.&nbsp; Some hated thought
seemed to have him in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that
he could not advance.</p>
<p>We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was
before us.&nbsp; Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over
them a glare such as I never saw before or since.&nbsp; Pain,
shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily
to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under
his ebon eyebrow.&nbsp; Wild was the wrestle which should be
paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard
and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and
petrified his countenance: he went on—</p>
<p>“During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was
arranging a point with my destiny.&nbsp; She stood there, by that
beech-trunk—a hag like one of those who appeared to Macbeth
on the heath of Forres.&nbsp; ‘You like Thornfield?’
she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a
memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the
house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows,
‘Like it if you can!&nbsp; Like it if you dare!’</p>
<p>“‘I will like it,’ said I; ‘I dare
like it;’ and” (he subjoined moodily) “I will
keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
goodness—yes, goodness.&nbsp; I wish to be a better man
than I have been, than I am; as Job’s leviathan broke the
spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others count
as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten
wood.”</p>
<p>Adèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock.&nbsp;
“Away!” he cried harshly; “keep at a distance,
child; or go in to Sophie!”&nbsp; Continuing then to pursue
his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point whence
he had abruptly diverged—</p>
<p>“Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked,
“when Mdlle. Varens entered?”</p>
<p>I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed
question, but, on the contrary, waking out of his scowling
abstraction, he turned his eyes towards me, and the shade seemed
to clear off his brow.&nbsp; “Oh, I had forgotten
Céline!&nbsp; Well, to resume.&nbsp; When I saw my charmer
thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss,
and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from
the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way
in two minutes to my heart’s core.&nbsp; Strange!” he
exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.&nbsp;
“Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all
this, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me
quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a
man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint,
inexperienced girl like you!&nbsp; But the last singularity
explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your
gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the
recipient of secrets.&nbsp; Besides, I know what sort of a mind I
have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not
liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique
one.&nbsp; Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it
would not take harm from me.&nbsp; The more you and I converse,
the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh
me.”&nbsp; After this digression he proceeded—</p>
<p>“I remained in the balcony.&nbsp; ‘They will come
to her boudoir, no doubt,’ thought I: ‘let me prepare
an ambush.’&nbsp; So putting my hand in through the open
window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening
through which I could take observations; then I closed the
casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet
to lovers’ whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair;
and as I resumed it the pair came in.&nbsp; My eye was quickly at
the aperture.&nbsp; Céline’s chamber-maid entered,
lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.&nbsp; The couple
were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and
there was ‘the Varens,’ shining in satin and
jewels,—my gifts of course,—and there was her
companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a
young roué of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious
youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought
of hating because I despised him so absolutely.&nbsp; On
recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly
broken; because at the same moment my love for Céline sank
under an extinguisher.&nbsp; A woman who could betray me for such
a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn;
less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.</p>
<p>“They began to talk; their conversation eased me
completely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it
was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener.&nbsp; A
card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived, brought my
name under discussion.&nbsp; Neither of them possessed energy or
wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
they could in their little way: especially Céline, who
even waxed rather brilliant on my personal
defects—deformities she termed them.&nbsp; Now it had been
her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
called my ‘<i>beauté mâle</i>:’ wherein
she differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at
the second interview, that you did not think me handsome.&nbsp;
The contrast struck me at the time and—”</p>
<p>Adèle here came running up again.</p>
<p>“Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has
called and wishes to see you.”</p>
<p>“Ah! in that case I must abridge.&nbsp; Opening the
window, I walked in upon them; liberated Céline from my
protection; gave her notice to vacate her hotel; offered her a
purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics,
prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the
vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.&nbsp; Next morning
I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of
his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the
pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.&nbsp; But
unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this
filette Adèle, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and
perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity
written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.&nbsp;
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her
child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.&nbsp; I
acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be
supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her
father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I e’en
took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and
transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of
an English country garden.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax found you to train
it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a
French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your
post and protégée: you will be coming to me some
day with notice that you have found another place—that you
beg me to look out for a new governess,
&amp;c.—Eh?”</p>
<p>“No: Adèle is not answerable for either her
mother’s faults or yours: I have a regard for her; and now
that I know she is, in a sense, parentless—forsaken by her
mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall cling closer to her
than before.&nbsp; How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of
a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to
a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a
friend?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that is the light in which you view it!&nbsp; Well,
I must go in now; and you too: it darkens.”</p>
<p>But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and
Pilot—ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore
and shuttlecock.&nbsp; When we went in, and I had removed her
bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour,
allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some
little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray
when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial
to an English mind.&nbsp; Still she had her merits; and I was
disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the
utmost.&nbsp; I sought in her countenance and features a likeness
to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn of expression
announced relationship.&nbsp; It was a pity: if she could but
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of
her.</p>
<p>It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for
the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had
told me.&nbsp; As he had said, there was probably nothing at all
extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy
Englishman’s passion for a French dancer, and her treachery
to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but
there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion
which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly
revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs.&nbsp; I
meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting
it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to the
consideration of my master’s manner to myself.&nbsp; The
confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to
my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.&nbsp; His
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me
than at the first.&nbsp; I never seemed in his way; he did not
take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the
encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a
smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his presence,
I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I
really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening
conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
benefit.</p>
<p>I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk
with relish.&nbsp; It was his nature to be communicative; he
liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of
its scenes and ways (I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked
ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale on
which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were</p></body></html>
