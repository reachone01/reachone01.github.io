﻿<div class='layout'><p>3</p><p></p></div> <div class='layout'><p>Chapter Three In the empty Courtroom - The Student - The Offices</p><p>三　在空荡荡的审讯室里－学生－办公室</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>Every day over the following week, K. expected another summons to arrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had been taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not come by Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, without being told, to appear at the same place at the same time. So on Sunday, he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door. It was opened as soon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen last time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight into the adjoining room when she said to him "There's no session today". "What do you mean; no session?" he asked, unable to believe it. But the woman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room. It was indeed empty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous Sunday. On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before with a few books laying on it. "Can I have a look at those books?" asked K., not because he was especially curious but so that he would not have come for nothing. "No," said the woman as she re-closed the door, "that's not allowed. Those books belong to the examining judge." "I see," said K., and nodded, "those books must be law books, and that's how this court does things, not only to try people who are innocent but even to try them without letting them know what's going on." "I expect you're right," said the woman, who had not understood exactly what he meant. "I'd better go away again, then," said K. "Should I give a message to the examining judge?" asked the woman. "Do you know him, then?" asked K. "Of course I know him," said the woman, "my husband is the court usher." It was only now that K. noticed that the room, which before had held nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted out as a living room. The woman saw how surprised he was and said, "Yes, we're allowed to live here as we like, only we have to clear the room out when the court's in session. There's lots of disadvantages to my husband's job." "It's not so much the room that surprises me," said K., looking at her crossly, "it's your being married that shocks me." "Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in session, when I disturbed what you were saying?" asked the woman. "Of course," said K., "it's in the past now and I've nearly forgotten about it, but at the time it made me furious. And now you tell me yourself that you are a married woman." "It wasn't any disadvantage for you to have your speech interrupted. The way they talked about you after you'd gone was really bad." "That could well be," said K., turning away, "but it does not excuse you." "There's no-one I know who'd hold it against me," said the woman. "Him, who put his arms around me, he's been chasing after me for a long time. I might not be very attractive for most people, but I am for him. I've got no protection from him, even my husband has had to get used to it; if he wants to keep his job he's got to put up with it as that man's a student and he'll almost certainly be very powerful later on. He's always after me, he'd only just left when you arrived." "That fits in with everything else," said K., "I'm not surprised." "Do you want to make things a bit better here?" the woman asked slowly, watching him as if she were saying something that could be as dangerous for K. as for herself. "That's what I thought when I heard you speak, I really liked what you said. Mind you, I only heard part of it, I missed the beginning of it and at the end I was lying on the floor with the student - it's so horrible here," she said after a pause, and took hold of K.'s hand. "Do you believe you really will be able to make things better?" K. smiled and twisted his hand round a little in her soft hands. "It's really not my job to make things better here, as you put it," he said, "and if you said that to the examining judge he would laugh at you or punish you for it. I really would not have become involved in this matter if I could have helped it, and I would have lost no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better. But because I'm told that I have been arrested - and I am under arrest - it forces me to take some action, and to do so for my own sake. However, if I can be of some service to you in the process I will, of course, be glad to do so. And I will be glad to do so not only for the sake of charity but also because you can be of some help to me." "How could I help you, then?" said the woman. "You could, for example, show me the books on the table there." "Yes, certainly," the woman cried, and pulled K. along behind her as she rushed to them. The books were old and well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its middle, and it was held together with a few threads. "Everything is so dirty here," said K., shaking his head, and before he could pick the books up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron. K. took hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent picture appeared. A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the base intent of whoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking in skill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and the woman who dominated the picture with their bodies, sitting in overly upright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficult for them to approach each other. K. didn't thumb through that book any more, but just threw open the next one at its title page, it was a novel with the title, What Grete Suffered from her Husband, Hans. "So this is the sort of law book they study here," said K., "this is the sort of person sitting in judgement over me." "I can help you," said the woman, "would you like me to?" "Could you really do that without placing yourself in danger? You did say earlier on that your husband is wholly dependent on his superiors." "I still want to help you," said the woman, "come over here, we've got to talk about it. Don't say any more about what danger I'm in, I only fear danger where I want to fear it. Come over here." She pointed to the podium and invited him to sit down on the step with her. "You've got lovely dark eyes," she said after they had sat down, looking up into K.'s face, "people say I've got nice eyes too, but yours are much nicer. It was the first thing I noticed when you first came here. That's even why I came in here, into the assembly room, afterwards, I'd never normally do that, I'm not really even allowed to." So that's what all this is about, thought K., she's offering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else around here, she's had enough of the court officials, which is understandable I suppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about his eyes. With that, K. stood up in silence as if he had spoken his thoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the woman. "I don't think you can be of any assistance to me," he said, "to be of any real assistance you would need to be in contact with high officials. But I'm sure you only know the lower employees, and there are crowds of them milling about here. I'm sure you're very familiar with them and could achieve a great deal through them, I've no doubt of that, but the most that could be done through them would have no bearing at all on the final outcome of the trial. You, on the other hand, would lose some of your friends as a result, and I have no wish of that. Carry on with these people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem to me to be something you cannot do without. I have no regrets in saying this as, in return for your compliment to me, I also find you rather attractive, especially when you look at me as sadly as you are now, although you really have no reason to do so. You belong to the people I have to combat, and you're very comfortable among them, you're even in love with the student, or if you don't love him you do at least prefer him to your husband. It's easy to see that from what you've been saying." "No!" she shouted, remained sitting where she was and grasped K.'s hand, which he failed to pull away fast enough. "You can't go away now, you can't go away when you've misjudged me like that! Are you really capable of going away now? Am I really so worthless that you won't even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer?" "You misunderstand me," said K., sitting back down, "if it's really important to you for me to stay here then I'll be glad to do so, I have plenty of time, I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place. All I meant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my behalf in the proceedings against me. But even that is nothing for you to worry about when you consider that there's nothing hanging on the outcome of this trial, and that, whatever the verdict, I will just laugh at it. And that's even presupposing it ever even reaches any conclusion, which I very much doubt. I think it's much more likely that the court officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even to fearful ever to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be abandoned if they haven't been abandoned already. It's even possible that they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of receiving a large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be quite in vain as I pay bribes to no-one. Perhaps one favour you could do me would be to tell the examining judge, or anyone else who likes to spread important news, that I will never be induced to pay any sort of bribe through any stratagem of theirs - and I'm sure they have many stratagems at their disposal. There is no prospect of that, you can tell them that quite openly. And what's more, I expect they have already noticed themselves, or even if they haven't, this affair is really not so important to me as they think. Those gentlemen would only save some work for themselves, or at least some unpleasantness for me, which, however, I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of unpleasantness for me is a blow against them. And I will make quite sure it is a blow against them. Do you actually know the judge?" "Course I do," said the woman, "he was the first one I thought of when I offered to help you. I didn't know he's only a minor official, but if you say so it must be true. Mind you, I still think the report he gives to his superiors must have some influence. And he writes so many reports. You say these officials are lazy, but they're certainly not all lazy, especially this examining judge, he writes ever such a lot. Last Sunday, for instance, that session went on till the evening. Everyone had gone, but the examining judge, he stayed in the hall, I had to bring him a lamp in, all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he was very satisfied with it and started to write straight away. Meantime my husband arrived, he always has the day off on Sundays, we got the furniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the neighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit by a candle, in short, we forgot all about the examining judge and went to bed. All of a sudden in the night, it must have been quite late in the night, I wakes up, next to the bed, there's the examining judge shading the lamp with his hand so that there's no light from it falls on my husband, he didn't need to be as careful as that, the way my husband sleeps the light wouldn't have woken him up anyway. I was quite shocked and nearly screamed, but the judge was very friendly, warned me I should be careful, he whispered to me he's been writing all this time, and now he's brought me the lamp back, and he'll never forget how I looked when he found me there asleep. What I mean, with all this, I just wanted to tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports, especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main things on the agenda that Sunday. If he writes reports as long as that they must be of some importance. And besides all that, you can see from what happened that the examining judge is after me, and it's right now, when he's first begun to notice me, that I can have a lot of influence on him. And I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too. Yesterday, he sent that student to me, the one he really trusts and who he works with, he sent him with a present for me, silk stockings. He said it was because I clear up in the courtroom but that's only a pretence, that job's no more than what I'm supposed to do, it's what my husband gets paid for. Nice stockings, they are, look," - she stretched out her leg, drew her skirt up to her knee and looked, herself, at the stocking - "they are nice stockings, but they're too good for me, really."</p><p>在接下来的那个星期里，Ｋ日复一日地等待着再次传讯他的消息，他不能相信自己拒绝受审已被认可；到了星期六晚上，他还没有接到通知。于是他认为，他们准是等着他在原先的时间到那老地方去，这是不言而喻的。因此，他星期天上午又到那儿去了，这次他穿过走廊，登上楼梯，径直朝那个大厅走去；几个还记得他的人在自己的门口向他打招呼，但他已经没有必要向任何人问路了。他很快来到审讯室门口，刚敲门，门就开了。给他开门的女人站在门边，他甚至没有扭头看那女人一眼，便直接朝旁边的屋里走去。“今天不开庭，”那女人说。“为什么不开庭？”他问；他不信。那女人打开隔壁屋子的门后，他才相信了。屋子里确实是空荡荡的，看起来比上星期天更加令人不舒服。讲台上的那张桌子还像上次那样摆着，桌子上有几本书。“我可以去看看那些书吗？”Ｋ问，他并不是出于某种特殊的好奇心，而只是为了不白来一趟而已。“不行，”那女人一面说，一面把门关上，“这是不允许的。书是属于预审法官的。”“我知道了，”Ｋ点点头说，“那些书可能是法律书，这里施行的法律的主要部分都在那些书里，根据这些法律，你无罪也好，无知也好，都要被判刑。”“大概是吧，”那女人说，她没有完全听懂他的话。“好吧，既然这样，我最好还是走吧，”Ｋ说。“需要我给预审法官留个口信吗？”那女人问。“你认识他吗？”Ｋ问。“当然啰，”女人回答道，“你要知道，我丈夫是法院里的门房。”Ｋ只是在这时才发现，上星期天除了一个洗衣盆外一无所有的接待室，现在已经布置成了一个家具齐全的起居室了。那女人看见他的惊讶神色后说道：“是的，这间屋子是我们的家，不过在法院开庭的日子里，我们得把屋子腾出来，东西全得搬走。我丈夫的这个差使有很多不利的地方。”“我对屋子倒并不感到特别惊讶，”Ｋ严肃地看着她说，“惊讶的是你已经结过婚了。”“你大概指的是上次开庭时发生的事情吧：你在讲话的时候，我扰乱了秩序，”那女人说。“我当然指的是那件事，”Ｋ说，“现在已是旧事一桩了，我差不多已经忘了，不过当时却使我勃然大怒。现在你自己也说你是结过婚的人。”“当时打断你的话，并没有给你带来任何损害；从人们后来的议论来判断，你那天讲的话留下的印象很坏。”“这是可能的，”Ｋ说，他想转移话题，“但这不能成为你的遁词。”“所有认识我的人都会原谅我的，”那女人说，“你看见的那个搂着我的人，长期以来一直在死皮赖脸地追求我。我也许对大部分男人都没有吸引力，但对他还是很有吸引力的。我没有办法摆脱他，事到如今甚至我的丈夫也慢慢听之任之了；我丈夫如果不想丢掉饭碗，就必须忍受，因为你看见的那个人是个学生，将来很可能成为一个有权有势的大人物。他老追着我，他今天还来过，就在你来之前。”“这一切都是互相关联的，”Ｋ说，“我并不觉得奇怪。”“我想，你急于想法子改善这里的情况，”那女人慢吞吞地说，她注视着Ｋ，好像她说的话对她和Ｋ都有危险似的，“我是从你的话里猜出来的，我本人很喜欢你的讲话，虽然我只听见其中的一部分。开头我没听着，你快要讲完的时候，我和那个学生正躺在地板上，这儿真可怕。”她停了一会儿，拉住Ｋ的手说：“你想努力改善这儿的情况吗？”Ｋ微笑了一下，抚弄着她的柔软的手指。“其实，”他说，“并不像你所说的那样。改善这儿的情况并不是我的本分。因此，你如果跟预审法官说这些，他不是笑话你一顿，便是惩罚你一顿，我可以把话说在前头。老实说，我永远也不幻想能够按照我的自由意志在这里进行干预，因此我决不会为了考虑是否有必要改革这儿的司法机构而少睡一个钟头。但是，我似乎被捕了——你知道，我被捕了——这件事迫使我进行干预，以便保护我自己的利益。然而，如果在这同时，我能够用某种方式帮助你，我当然会很高兴的。这并非完全出于利他主义，因为你作为回报，也会助我一臂之力的。”“我怎么才能帮助你呢？”那女人问。“比如说，让我看看放在那张桌子上的书。”“当然可以！”那女人大声说道，并且立即领他去看。那都是些旧书，边角全卷着，有一本书的硬封面几乎从当中裂成两半，其间只连着几根细线。“这儿的所有东西都很脏！”Ｋ摇着头说，那女人不得不用围裙拭去那些书上蒙着的厚厚一层灰尘；Ｋ伸手去翻看，他打开第一本，就发现一幅不堪入目的画。一男一女光着身子坐在沙发上，画家的淫秽意图十分明显，不过他的画技拙劣，画面上只有两个僵硬呆板的人直挺挺地坐在那儿，别的什么也没有；另外，透视法也掌握得很差，画家显然想不出法子把他们画成面对面坐着。Ｋ没有翻看这本书的其它部分，接着他草草看了一眼第二本书的内封，这是一部小说，书名是《汉斯如何折磨他的妻子格蕾特》。“这儿研读的法律书便是这些玩意儿，”Ｋ说，“受命审判我的便是这些人。”“我愿意帮助你，”那女人说，“你希望我帮助你吗？”“你真的能够帮助我，同时又不至给自己造成麻烦吗？你刚才跟我说过，你丈夫在高级官员面前是惟命是听的。”“那没什么，我照样愿意帮助你，”那女人说，“好吧，咱们详细谈谈。别担心我会遇到什么危险。对于危险，我只是在想害怕它的时候才会害怕。来吧。”她坐在讲台边上，让Ｋ坐在自己身旁。“你有一双可爱的黑眼睛，”他俩坐后，她端详着Ｋ的脸说，“人家告诉我，我的眼睛也很可爱，不过，你的眼睛要可爱得多。你第一次来这儿的时候，我就对你一见钟情了。正是因为你的缘故，我后来偷偷溜进了会议厅。我以前从来没这么做过，可以说是不允许我这样做的。”“原来是这样，”Ｋ想道，“她自己送上门来了，她和他们一样堕落了。她对这儿的官员感到厌倦，这是很容易理解的；不管来了哪个陌生人，她的幻想都会被激起，她就会用各种方式去勾引他，比如说，恭维他的眼睛。”Ｋ站起身来，好像已经把自己的想法大声说出来了，自己的态度已经解释得很清楚了。“我并不认为你能帮助我，”他说，“要想帮助我，就需要和高级官员有关系。而我深信，你只认识一些在这儿转来转去的微不足道的低级职员。你很可能十分了解这些低级职员，可以使他们做许多事情，对此我一点也不怀疑。但是，哪怕他们竭尽全力，也不能对这件案子的最终结果产生任何影响。而你的几位朋友则会因此而与你疏远。我不希望那样。和那些人保持友谊吧，因为我觉得你需要这种友谊。我这么说感到很抱歉，因为我得承认，我也喜欢你——让我用这句话回答你对我的恭维吧。我特别喜欢你用哀伤的目光看着我，就像现在这样，虽然我可以向你担保，你没有任何理由需要这样。你的位置是在我要与之搏斗的那些人中间，你在他们中间如鱼得水，你爱那个学生，这是没有疑问的，或者说，即使你不爱他，至少你也觉得他比你丈夫好。从你的讲话中很容易看出这点。”“不，”她大声说道，她没有站起来，只是紧紧抓住Ｋ的手，Ｋ没有立即缩回手，“你现在不能走，你不能带着关于我的错误想法离开这儿。你难道真的忍心这样走开吗？难道我在你眼里真的这样一文不值，你就不想赏个脸，再多呆一会儿吗？”“你曲解了我，”Ｋ说，他重又坐下，“如果你真的希望我留下，那我将很高兴地留下，我有足够的时间；我到这儿来，本来是盼着法院开庭的。我想说的只是，请你不必为我的案子做任何事。请不必生气，如果你觉得我毫不在乎案子的结局会怎么样；即使给我判刑，我也只会一笑了之——当然，我们得假设本案会得出一个适当的结论，对此我是十分怀疑的，因为我认为，由于本案负责人的懒惰、健忘、甚至也可能是惧怕，这件案子实际上已经，或者即将束之高阁。当然，他们也可能装出继续办案的样子，试图在我身上敲诈勒索；但他们不必这样做，因为，我现在就可以告诉你，我永远也不会去贿赂任何人。你倒是可以为我做件事，你可以去告诉预审法官或者任何一个能把我的话传播出去的人，就说任何因素也不能促使我向这些官员们行贿，哪怕他们耍尽阴谋诡计也不行，他们在这方面无疑是很精明能干的。他们的企图不会有任何希望，你可以明白地告诉他们。但他们大概已经得出了这个结论，即使他们还没有得出这个结论，我也不在乎他们是否知道了这个消息。这只会使他们省点事，当然也会使我少遇到点麻烦；不过，我会高兴地忍受对他们也不利的任何不愉快的事件。我将谨慎行事，我要看到这种情况的发生。顺便问一句，你真的认识预审法官吗？”“当然啰，”那女人说，“当我提出帮助你时，第一个想到的就是他。我本来不知道他只是个微不足道的官员，但是既然你这么说，那当然是真的。尽管这样，我认为他向上司递交的报告是有某种影响的。他写很多报告。你说过，官员们懒惰，但这种说法肯定不适用于全体官员，尤其不适用于预审法官：他总是在写。举例说吧，上星期天，会议一直开到很晚才结束；其他人都走了，可是预审法官却继续留在审讯室里。我只好给他提一盏灯去，我只有一盏厨房里用的小灯，但是对他来说已经足够了。他立刻开始写东西。这时，我丈夫回家了，那个星期天他不上班，我们把家具搬回来，重新把屋子布置好。后来几个邻居来看我们，大家借着烛光聊天。说实话，我们把预审法官忘得一干二净了。我们上了床；到了半夜——那时准是很晚了——我突然被惊醒：预审法官站在我们的床边，用手遮着灯，免得灯光照着我丈夫。这是不必要的谨慎，因为我丈夫睡得很死，光线再强他也不会醒。我吓得差点喊出声来，不过预审法官却很客气，他让我多保重，低声对我说，他一直写到现在，他是来还灯的；还说，他永远也不会忘记我躺在床上睡觉的模样。我把这些告诉你，只是想说明，预审法官确实一直忙着写报告，特别是关于你的报告，因为对你的审讯肯定是那两天开会时的主要议题之一。像这么长的报告肯定是很重要的。但是，除此以外，你从已经发生的事情中可以清出，预审法官也开始对我产生兴趣了，而在开始阶段——因为他可能是第一次看上我——我可以对他施加很大的影响。到目前为止，我还有其它证据，可以说明他急于获得我的欢心。昨天，他通过那个学生给我送来一双丝袜，学生在他那儿工作，他俩交情可好呢；他说，这是为了报答我给他打扫审讯室。但这不过是借口而已，因为打扫屋子是我的职责，何况我的丈夫为此会得到报酬的。袜子真好看，你瞧，”她伸出双腿，把裙子撩到膝盖以上，开始欣赏起自己的袜子来，“袜子真好看，可是大漂亮了，对我这么一个女人不合适。”</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if she wanted to calm him down, and whispered, "Be quiet, Berthold is watching us." K. slowly looked up. In the doorway to the courtroom stood a young man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and he continually moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with which he hoped to make himself look dignified. K. looked at him with some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely attain high office one day. The student, in contrast, seemed to take no notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window, the woman leant over to K. and whispered, "Don't be cross with me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've got to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs. But I'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me, I'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be happy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best if I could get away from here for good." She stroked K.'s hand once more, jumped up and ran over to the window. Before he realised it, K. grasped for her hand but failed to catch it. He really was attracted to the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give in to her allure. It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off. In what way could she entrap him? Was he not still free, so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he wanted, as least where it concerned him? Could he not have that much confidence in himself? And her offer of help sounded sincere, and maybe it wasn't quite worthless. And maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself. Maybe then, after much hard work writing dishonest reports about K., the judge would go to the woman's bed late one night and find it empty. And it would be empty because she belonged to K., because this woman at the window, this lush, supple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy material belonged to him, totally to him and to him alone. </p><p>她突然住了嘴，把手放在Ｋ的手上，好像要让他放心，接着说：“嘘，贝托尔德在瞧着咱们。”Ｋ慢慢抬起眼睛。一个年轻人正站在审讯室门口，他个子矮小，双腿微弯，蓄着蓬乱的暗红色的短胡子，好让自己的外貌尽量显得威风点；他一直用手指捋着胡子。Ｋ兴致勃勃地看着他，这是Ｋ遇到的那个神秘法院里的第一个学生，现在他还默默无闻，但将来有一天很可能会得到一个高级职务。但是，那个学生却丝毫不理会Ｋ，他暂时停止捋胡子，伸出一个手指，向那女人打了个招呼后，便朝窗口走去。女人朝Ｋ俯过身去，低声说：“别生我的气，别以为我很坏，我现在得上他那儿去了，他是个模样可怕的人，你只要瞧瞧他那双罗圈腿就可以知道了。我一会儿就回来，然后我就跟你走，如果你愿意带我走的话；你想上哪儿，我就跟你上哪儿，你跟我在一起，愿意干什么都行。我只要能够长期离开这里，就会很高兴的；我真愿意永远离开这里。”她最后抚摸了一下Ｋ的手，便跳了起来，跑到窗前去了。Ｋ的手不由自主地随着她的手朝外伸出，停留在空中。那女人确实把他吸引住了，他经过深思熟虑后，认为可以向这种诱惑屈服，没有什么站得住脚的理由不能这样做。他轻而易举地打消了自己的疑虑：她也许是按法院的指示，企图引诱他钻进圈套。她用什么方法可以使他落入圈套吗？他不是有足够的自由可以永远藐视法院的权威、至少是藐视法院对他作出的判决吗？难道在这么小范围内他也不能信赖自己吗？她提出愿意帮忙，听起来是真心诚意的，也许并非完全没有价值。把这个女人从预审法官和他的下属手中夺走归自己所有，也许是对他们最合适的报复。这样，某天夜里，当预审法官开夜车绞尽脑汁地写完了谎话连篇的关于Ｋ的报告后，走到这女人的床边，就会发现人去床空了。床空了，因为她跟Ｋ私奔了，因为现在站在窗口的这个女人，这个裹在深色粗布衣服里面的柔软、温暖、妖烧的身躯已经属于Ｋ了，只属于Ｋ一人了。</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then even with his fist. The student briefly looked away from the woman to glance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around her. She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying. K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the room. Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which K. had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him, "You don't have to stay here, you know, if you're getting impatient. You could have gone earlier, no-one would have missed you. In fact you should have gone, you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as I got here." This comment could have caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K. also bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in speaking in this way. K. remained standing quite close to him and said with a smile, "You're quite right, I am impatient, but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you left us. On the other hand, if you've come here to study - you are a student, I hear - I'll be quite happy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman. I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge. It's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking roughly - and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well." "He shouldn't have been allowed to move about so freely," said the student, as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K.'s insults, "that was a mistake. I've told the examining judge so. He should at least have been detained in his room between hearings. Sometimes it's impossible to understand what the judge thinks he's doing." "You're wasting your breath," said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and said, "come with me." "So that's it," said the student, "oh no, you're not going to get her," and with a strength you would not have expected from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his back bent under the weight, ran with her to the door. In this way he showed, unmistakeably, that he was to some extent afraid of K., but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand. K. ran the few steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, "It's no good, it's the examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you, this little bastard…" and here she ran her hand over the student's face, "this little bastard won't let me." "And you don't want to be set free!" shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who then snapped at it with his teeth. "No!" shouted the woman, pushing K. away with both hands, "no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing!? That'd be the end of me. Let go of him, please just let go of him. He's only carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him." "Let him take you then, and I want to see nothing more of you," said K., enraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back so that he briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen, immediately jumped up all the higher with his burden. K. followed them slowly. He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered from these people. It was of course nothing to worry about, he accepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight. If he stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just with a kick. And he imagined the most laughable scene possible as an example of this, if this contemptible student, this inflated child, this knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's bed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness. K. so enjoyed imagining this scene that he decided to take the student along to Elsa with him if ever he should get the opportunity.</p><p>他摆脱了疑虑，这样琢磨了一阵以后，开始觉得窗口正在进行的窃窃私语未免延续得太久了，于是便用指关节敲桌子，接着捏紧拳头擂了起来。学生的目光越过那女人的肩膀，在Ｋ身上停留了一下；他并不感到难为情，反倒贴得她更近些，进而伸出双臂搂住她。她侧过头，像要专心致志地听他讲话，他乘她侧过头的时候，一面继续滔滔不绝地讲着，一面在她脖子上很响地接了个吻。Ｋ从这个举动中看出，学生确实可以对这女人为所欲为，就像刚才她抱怨的那样；Ｋ猛地站起来，开始在屋里踱来踱去。他斜着眼，打量着学生，同时心里盘算着怎样才能尽快摆脱他。Ｋ的来回踱步变成了生气的跺脚，学生显然被他弄烦了，对他说：“如果你等得不耐烦了，你可以走嘛。你早就该走啦，谁也没拽住你，谁也不会想念你的。其实，我一进来，你就应该赶快走开。”学生讲这几句话时怒气冲冲，专横傲慢，俨然是一个正在向讨厌的囚徒训话的未来的法官。Ｋ走到学生身旁笑着说：“我等得不耐烦了，这是真的；然而，消除我的不耐烦情绪的最简便的方法是你离开我们。当然，如果你万一是到这里来看书的——我听说你是学生——我将很乐意带着这个女人离开，给你腾出个地方。我想，你在成为法官之前，在学习中还有漫长的道路要走。我承认，我不大熟悉法学训练的细节，但是我想，法学训练不会只教学生出言不逊——看来你在这方面已经精通到恬不知耻的程度了。”“不能让他在外面乱窜，”学生说，好像试图向那女人解释刚才Ｋ说的那番侮辱性的话，“这样做是错误的，我曾经跟预审法官讲过。在非审讯期间，起码应该把他软禁在自己的房间里。有的时候，我简直无法理解预审法官。”“光说话有什么用？”Ｋ说，并朝那女人伸出手，“来吧！”“噢，原来是这么回事，”学生说，“不，不，你不能得到她。”他随即伸出一只手把她举起，谁都没想到他会有这么大力气；他一面温情脉脉地凝视着她，一面朝门口跑去，由于手上的分量而微微弯着腰。学生的这个举动清楚地表明他对Ｋ有些畏惧；但他仍然冒着进一步激怒Ｋ的危险，用另一只空着的手抚摸或紧捏着那女人的胳臂。Ｋ追了他几步，准备揪住他，必要的话还要掐住他的脖子；正在这时，那女人却说道：“这没用处，预审法官派他来找我，我不敢和你走；这个小魔鬼，”她拍拍学生的脸说，“这个小魔鬼不会让我走的。”“你自己也不想得到自由，”Ｋ嚷道；他伸出手，按在学生肩上，学生用牙齿咬他的手。“不，”那女人嚷道；她伸出两只手，把Ｋ推开，“不，不，你不能这样做，你想干什么？这样会毁了我的。让他去吧，唉，让他去吧！他只不过是听从预审法官的命令，把我带到预审法官那儿去罢了。”“好吧，我放他走，至于你，我永远也不想再看见你了，”Ｋ说；他由于失望而怒火中烧，便朝着学生的后背猛推一把。学生一时跌跌撞撞，但没有摔倒，他着实松了一口气，以更加敏捷的步子一蹦一跳地走了。Ｋ跟在他们后面慢慢走着，他承认这是第一次明白无误地败在这些人手中。当然，他没有理由因此懊丧，他受挫了，是他自找的，因为他想先发制人。他安安静静地呆在家里的时候，以及出门干正事的时候，比这些人都强，他们中如果有人挡了他的道，他就可以把那人一脚踢开。他脑中设想着一个可能出现的十分可笑的场面，比如说，这个讨厌的学生，这个趾高气扬、妄自尊大的年轻人，这个长着罗圈腿的丑八怪，有那么一天会跪在艾尔莎床前，痛苦地搓着手，乞求她的垂青。他想到这种场面甚为开心，于是决定一有机会就带学生去拜访艾尔莎。</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry her through the streets on his arm. It turned out that the journey was far shorter. Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden steps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so that it was not possible to see where they ended. The student carried the woman up these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he was soon groaning and moving very slowly. The woman waved down at K. and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was an innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a lot of regret. K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily get over his disappointment.</p><p>Ｋ被好奇心所驱使，匆匆走到门口，想看看那女人被带到哪儿去了，因为那学生绝不可能抱着她穿过街道。他们其实没走多远，一出门就是一道狭窄的木楼梯，好像是通到阁楼上去的；楼梯拐了一个弯，那一头看不见。学生抱着那女人上了这道楼梯，他走得很慢，一面哼哼，一面“呼哧呼哧”直喘气，因为他的力气快用完了。那女人朝站在下面的Ｋ摆摆手，耸耸肩，表明她在这次劫持中不应该受到指责；然而她却几乎没有反抗，任凭这场哑剧演下去。Ｋ毫无表情地看着她，好像她是一个陌生人；他决定不在她面前流露出自己的失望情绪，也不让她知道他能轻而易举地克服自己可能感到的任何失望情绪。</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>The two of them had disappeared, but K. remained standing in the doorway. He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the examining judge. The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting and waiting in the attic. The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him however long he stared at them. Then K. noticed a small piece of paper next to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised hand, "Entrance to the Court Offices". Were the court offices here, in the attic of this tenement, then? If that was how they were accommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfort for the accused to realise how little money this court had at its disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of the building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, would throw their unneeded junk. On the other hand, it was possible that the officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves rather than use it for the court's purposes. Going by K.'s experience of them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply in a state of poverty. K. also now understood that the court was ashamed to summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial hearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes. What a position it was that K. found himself in, compared with the judge sitting up in the attic! K., at the bank, had a big office with an ante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look down at the activity in the square. It was true, though, that he had no secondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm. K., however, was quite willing to do without such things, in this life at least. </p><p>那两个人已经消失了，然而Ｋ还站在门口。他不得不作出这样的结论：那女人不但背叛了他，而且还欺骗了他，她说是被带到预审法官那儿去的。预审法官肯定不会坐在阁楼上等着。这道狭窄的木楼梯不会使人产生什么联想，不管看它多久也枉然。可是Ｋ却发现，楼梯旁边钉着一张小小的硬纸片。他走过去，看见上面有一行似乎是没有练过字的小孩子写的字：“法院办公室在楼上”。这么说来，法院办公室就设在这座房子的阁楼上啰？这种安排好像不能使人产生崇敬的心情；房客都是些穷愁潦倒的人，但连他们也只在阁楼里堆放些没用的废旧家具，可是法院却把自己的办公室设在这里；当一个被告想到，这个法院手头只有这么点钱，他的心里就会坦然不少。当然也不能无视这种可能性：钱是够多的，但是法官们把它塞进了自己的腰包，而没有用到司法业务上去。根据Ｋ迄今为止积累的经验判断，这是绝对可能的；如果真的如此，这种不光彩的行径虽然会让被告瞧不起，但却能给他带来更多的好处；在一个确实是贫穷的法院里，这点是很难做到的。Ｋ现在也明白，当初他们为什么不好意思把他带到阁楼上来，而选择在他的家里折磨他。Ｋ和法官一比，条件多优越啊：法官只能在阁楼里将就着，而Ｋ却在银行里有一间宽敞的办公室，旁边还有一间会客室，他可以透过大玻璃窗，欣赏都市的繁华景象。不错，他没有额外收入，不受贿，不贪污，也不能命令下属去找个女人带到他的房间里来。然而Ｋ却心甘情愿地放弃这些特权，至少这辈子不想得到这些特权。</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>K. was still looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, looked through the open door into the living room where it was also possible to see the courtroom, and finally asked K. whether he had just seen a woman there. "You're the court usher, aren't you?" asked K. "That's right," said the man, "oh, yes, you're defendant K., I recognise you now as well. Nice to see you here." And he offered K. his hand, which was far from what K. had expected. And when K. said nothing, he added, "There's no court session planned for today, though." "I know that," said K. as he looked at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary buttons, displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and seemed to have been taken from an old army officer's coat. "I was speaking with your wife a little while ago. She is no longer here. The student has carried her off to the examining judge." "Listen to this," said the usher, "they're always carrying her away from me. It's Sunday today, and it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send me off with some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away from here. What they do is they send me off not too far away so that I can still hope to get back on time if I really hurry. So off I go running as fast as I can, shout the message through the crack in the door of the office I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be able to understand it, run back here again, but the student's been even faster than I have - well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run down the steps. If I wasn't so dependent on them I'd have squashed the student against the wall here a long time ago. Right here, next to the sign. I'm always dreaming of doing that. Just here, just above the floor, that's where he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out, his fingers spread apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle and blood squirted out all around him. It's only ever been a dream so far, though." "Is there nothing else you do?" asked K. with a smile. "Nothing that I know of," said the usher. "And it's going to get even worse now, up till now he's only been carrying her off for himself, now he's started carrying her off for the judge and all, just like I'd always said he would." "Does your wife, then, not share some of the responsibility?" asked K. He had to force himself as he asked this question, as he, too, felt so jealous now. "Course she does," said the usher, "it's more her fault than theirs. It was her who attached herself to him. All he did, he just chases after any woman. There's five flats in this block alone where he's been thrown out after working his way in there. And my wife is the best looking woman in the whole building, but it's me who's not even allowed to defend himself." "If that's how things are, then there's nothing that can be done," said K. "Well why not?" asked the usher. "He's a coward that student, if he wants to lay a finger on my wife all you'd have to do is give him such a good hiding he'd never dare do it again. But I'm not allowed to do that, and nobody else is going to do me the favour as they're all afraid of his power. The only one who could do it is a man like you." "What, how could I do it?" asked K. in astonishment. "Well you're facing a charge, aren't you," said the usher. "Yes, but that's all the more reason for me to be afraid. Even if he has no influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the initial examination." "Yes, exactly," said the usher, as if K.'s view had been just as correct as his own. "Only we don't usually get any trials heard here with no hope at all." "I am not of the same opinion", said K., "although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the student if the opportunity arises." "I would be very grateful to you," said the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming to believe that his highest wish could be fulfilled. "Perhaps," continued K., "perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps all of them, who would deserve the same." "Oh yes, yes," said the usher, as if this was a matter of course. Then he looked at K. trustingly which, despite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added, "they're always rebelling." But the conversation seemed to have become a little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, "now I have to report to the office. Would you like to come with me?" "There's nothing for me to do there," said K. "You'd be able to have a look at it. No-one will take any notice of you." "Is it worth seeing then?" asked K. hesitatingly, although he felt very keen to go with him. "Well," said the usher, "I thought you'd be interested in it." "Alright then," said K. finally, "I'll come with you." And, quicker than the usher himself, he ran up the steps.</p><p>Ｋ正伫立在那张硬纸片旁边，一个男人从下面走上来。他透过开着的门看看屋内，从这里也能看见更里面的那间审讯室。他问Ｋ是不是在什么地方看见过一个女人。“你是门房，对不对？”Ｋ问。“对，”那人说。“啊，你是被告Ｋ，我认出你来了，欢迎，欢迎。”他出乎意料地朝Ｋ伸出手来。“可是，没有宣布今天要开庭，”门房见Ｋ不说话，便接着说下去。“我知道，”Ｋ说，一面注视着那人身上穿的便服，上面除了普通扣子外，还有两颗像是从旧军装上扯下来的镀金钮扣，这是表明他职务的惟一标志。“我刚才还跟你妻子讲过话。现在她不在这儿，学生把她带到楼上预审法官那儿去了。”“又来了，”门房说，“他们老是把她从我身边带走。今天是星期日，我本来用不着于任何活，可是他们为了支开我，却派我到外面去白白跑了一趟。他们存着心眼，不把我支使得太远，让我怀着要是抓紧时间，就可以及时赶回来的希望。正因为如此，我尽可能快点走，刚跑到那个办公室门口，就朝半开着的门大喊几声，把口信传了进去。我喊得气都快透不过来了，他们很难听懂我喊话的意思。然后我又全速往回跑，可是那个学生还是比我先到。当然，他到这儿来的路不远，只需沿着那一小段木楼梯从阁楼上走下来就行了。如果我的工作不至于受到影响的话，我早就把那个学生逼到这堵墙跟前，把他揍成个肉饼了。就把他揍死在这张硬纸片旁边。我每天连做梦都想着这件事。我看见他在这里被揍扁了，就在楼梯口上面一点：他的两只胳臂摊开，五指伸直，两条罗圈腿扭成一个圆圈，地上全是血。可是到目前为止，这只不过是做梦而已。”“没有别的法子了吗？”Ｋ笑着问。“据我所知，没别的法子了，”门房说，“现在的情况比以前更糟：他从前把她带走，只是为了自己寻欢作乐；但现在我可以说，他也把她带到预审法官那儿去，我早就料到了。”“不过，你的妻子不是也应该受到谴责吗？”Ｋ问；他问这个问题的时候，不得不抑制自己的感情，因为他还在吃醋。“那当然啰，”门房说，“她最应该受到谴责。她是自己投入他的怀抱的。至于他，看见所有的女人都要追。仅仅在这座楼里，他就因为想偷偷溜进别人家里，而被五户人家赶了出来。我妻子在整个公寓里是最漂亮的女人，而我所处的地位又使我无法自卫。”“如果事情真是这样，那看来就没有希望了，”Ｋ说。“为什么没有希望呢？”门房问，“如果他在追求我妻子时，被狠狠地接过一两次——不管怎样，他是个胆小鬼——他就再也不敢这么干了。可是我不能接他，也没有任何人会帮我去揍他，因为大家都怕他，他是个很有影响的人物。只有像你这样的人才敢揍他。”“为什么像我这样的人才敢揍他呢？”Ｋ迷惑不解地问道。“你被捕了，对不对？”门房说。“对，”Ｋ答道。“这意味着我更得怕他，因为虽然他也许不至于影响案子的结局，但是他大概能影响预审。”“是的，是这么回事，”门房说，好像Ｋ关于这件事情的看法和他的看法一样不言而喻。“不过，按照一般规则，我们的案子全是事先就判好了的。”“我并不这么认为，”Ｋ说，“不过，这不妨碍我去对付那个学生。”“那我将十分感谢你，”门房一本正经地说，他看来并不相信自己的夙愿能够实现。“你们还有一些官员，”Ｋ继续说，“也许是所有的官员，都应该如此对待。”“噢，是的，”门房说，好像他认可的是一个常识问题。然后，他信任地看了Ｋ一眼，他尽管一直对Ｋ很友好，但在此之前还没敢用这种目光。门房补充道：“一个人不可能不反抗。”但这种交谈似乎仍然使他觉得不安，因为他不想再往下谈了，便以下面这句话作为结束语：“我现在该到上面去汇报了。你愿意和我一块去吗？”“我到那儿去没事，”Ｋ说。“你可以去看一看办公室嘛，谁也不会注意你的。”“怎么，办公室值得一看吗？”Ｋ犹豫不决地问道，他突然产生了上去看看的强烈愿望。“我想，”门房说，“你会感兴趣的。”“好吧，”Ｋ最后说，“我和你一起去。”于是，他跑着上了楼梯，比门房还快。</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was another step. "They don't show much concern for the public," he said. "They don't show any concern at all," said the usher, "just look at the waiting room here." It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. There was no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to the ceiling to separate them from the corridor. The light made its way in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the gaps. There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it was Sunday. They were not very impressive. They sat, equally spaced, on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides of the corridor. All of them were carelessly dressed although the expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to the upper classes. There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the example of the others. When those who were sitting nearest the door saw K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up. None of them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they stood like beggars on the street. K. waited for the usher, who was following just behind him. "They must all be very dispirited," he said. "Yes," said the usher, "they are the accused, everyone you see here has been accused." "Really!" said K. "They're colleagues of mine then." And he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair that was nearly grey. "What is it you are waiting for here?" asked K., politely, but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly, which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here, though, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this help. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, "The gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for. You can give him an answer." The voice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect than K.'s. "I'm … I'm waiting …" he began, and then came to a halt. He had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise answer to the question, but now he didn't know how to continue. Some of the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher of the court said to them, "Get out the way, keep the gangway free." They moved back slightly, but not as far as where they had been sitting before. In the meantime, the man whom K. had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him with a smile. "A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my case, and I'm waiting for it to be settled." "You certainly seem to be going to a lot of effort," said K. "Yes," said the man, "it is my affair after all." "Not everyone thinks the same way as you do," said K. "I've been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that I've neither submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort. Do you really think that's necessary?" "I don't really know, exactly," said the man, once more totally unsure of himself; he clearly thought K. was joking with him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid making any new mistakes. With K. looking at him impatiently, he just said, "as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to have this evidence heard." "Perhaps you don't believe I've been indicted?" asked K. "Oh, please, I certainly do," said the man, stepping slightly to one side, but there was more anxiety in his answer than belief. "You don't believe me then?" asked K., and took hold of his arm, unconsciously prompted by the man's humble demeanour, and as if he wanted to force him to believe him. But he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him very lightly. Nonetheless, the man cried out as if K. had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot tongs. Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K. tired of him, if he didn't believe he was indicted then so much the better; maybe he even thought K. was a judge. And before leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench and walked on. "These defendants are so sensitive, most of them," said the usher of the court. Almost all of those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who, by now, had stopped shouting and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident. K. was approached by a security guard, identifiable mainly by his sword, of which the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium. This greatly surprised K., and he reached out for it with his hand. The guard had come because of the shouting and asked what had been happening. The usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it himself, saluted, and hurried on, walking with very short steps, probably because of gout.</p><p>他进门的时候差点绊了一跤，因为门后还有一级阶梯。“他们不大考虑公众，”他说。“他们什么也不考虑，”门房回答道，“你看看这间候审室。”这是一条长走廊，两旁是一扇扇简陋的门，通向本层的各个办公室。虽然走廊里没有窗子，透不进光线来，但不是漆黑一片，因为有些办公室并非一关门就和走廊完全隔绝，门上有个木格小窗和屋顶相通，光线可以从那儿透进一点儿来。借着这点光线，人们还能看见办公室里的职员有的在伏案书写，有的站在木格小窗前，透过木格看着走廊里的人。走廊里人不多，大概是星期天的关系。他们的样子很谦恭，坐在固定在走廊两侧的一排木制长凳上，彼此间的距离大致相等。他们穿的衣服一点也不考究，虽然从他们的脸部表情、行为举止、胡子的式样和很多不易觉察的细节上判断，这些人显然属于上等阶层。由于走廊里没有衣帽钩，他们都把帽子塞到长凳下，很可能是依次模仿的结果。坐在离门最近的那几个人看见Ｋ和门房后，彬彬有礼地站了起来，他们旁边的人也跟着站起来；他们似乎认为这样做是应该的。因此，当这两个人走过时，大家都站起来了。他们站得不很直，驼着背，屈着膝，像是沿街乞讨的叫花子。Ｋ等走在后面的门房赶上来时对他说：“他们多么谦恭有礼啊！”“是的，”门房说，“他们是被告，他们全是被告。”“原来如此！”Ｋ说，“这么说来，他们是我的难友。”于是，他朝自己身边的一个人转过脸去，这是一个高个子，身材颀长，头发几乎全已染霜。“您在这儿等什么？”Ｋ客客气气地问道。可是，这个出乎意料的问题却使那人十分慌张，Ｋ对此甚为不解，因为那人显然是个饱经世故的人，应该知道在各种场合下需要怎么办，决不会轻易放弃自己天生的优越感。可是，他在这里却不晓得怎么回答一个这样简单的问题，只好瞧着其他人，好像他们有责任要帮助他。他似乎在说，如果没有人帮他解围，那谁也别指望他会回答。于是门房走上前来，讲了一句使他安心和鼓起他勇气的话：“这位先生只是问你在等什么，你就给他一个回答吧。”门房的亲切的声音取得了效果：“我是在等——”那人开口说道，可是再也说不下去了。显然，他开头是想对这个问题作出一个准确的答复，可是后来不知该怎么往下说了。另外几个当事人凑上前来，聚在他们周围；门房对他们说：“走开，别挡道。”他们稍微后退了几步，但并没有回到原来的位置上去。与此同时，那人恢复了镇静，笑着回答道：“一个月以前，我递交过几份关于我的案子的宣誓书，现在正等着结果呐。”“看来你为自己添了很多麻烦，”Ｋ说。“是的，”那人说，“因为这是我自己的案子嘛。”“不见得每个人都会像你这么想，”Ｋ说，“例如，我也被捕了，可是就像我站在这儿一样的确切无疑，我从来没有交过什么宣誓书，也没有干过任何类似的事情。难道你觉得这种事非做不可吗？”“我说不上来，”那人回答道，他又一次失去了自信；他显然以为Ｋ在拿他寻开心，为了避免再次出错，似乎想重新详详细细地回答Ｋ的第一个问题；但他见Ｋ用不耐烦的目光瞧着他，便只说了句：“不管怎么说，我已经把宣誓书交上去了。”“你大概不相信我被捕了？”Ｋ问。“噢，我当然相信，”那人朝旁边退了几步说，然而在他的口气中却没有相信的成分，只有忧虑而已。“看来你并不是真的相信我，对吗？”Ｋ问道；那人一副奴颜婢膝的样子使Ｋ感到莫名其妙的愤怒，便伸出两个手指，掐住那人的胳膊，像是要逼着那人相信他的话。他并不想使那人受伤，几乎没有使劲，可是那人却嚷了起来，好像Ｋ不是用两个指头，而是用一把钳子掐住他的胳膊。这种可笑的叫嚷使Ｋ不能忍受；如果那人不相信Ｋ被捕了，这更好；他大概真的把Ｋ当成法官了。Ｋ和那人分手时，狠狠捏了他一下，把他推回到长凳上，然后自己继续往前走。“大多数被告都这么敏感，”门房说。他们走后，差不多所有当事人都聚在那人周围；那人已不再叫唤了，他们好像在殷切地问他到底是怎么回事。一个卫兵走到Ｋ跟前，Ｋ主要是根据来者身上佩着剑知道他是卫兵的。卫兵的剑鞘是铝制品，起码从颜色上判断是这样。Ｋ目瞪口呆地看着剑鞘，并且还伸出手去摸了摸。卫兵来调查这儿乱成一团的原因，询问发生了什么事。门房想用几句话把他支使开，然而卫兵坚持要亲眼看看到底出了什么事。他跟门房说声再见，便神气活现地继续往前走了；他走得很快，但步子不大，大概是患有痛风病的缘故。</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people, especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that way. He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the usher nodded, and that is the way that K. went. The usher remained always one or two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him. In order to put an end to his discomfort, K. finally said, "Now that I've seen what it looks like here, I'd like to go." "You haven't seen everything yet," said the usher ingenuously. "I don't want to see everything," said K., who was also feeling very tired, "I want to go, what is the way to the exit?" "You haven't got lost, have you?" asked the usher in amazement, "you go down this way to the corner, then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as the door." "Come with me," said K., "show me the way, I'll miss it, there are so many different ways here." "It's the only way there is," said the usher, who had now started to sound quite reproachful, "I can't go back with you again, I've got to hand in my report, and I've already lost a lot of time because of you as it is." "Come with me!" K. repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher out in a lie. "Don't shout like that," whispered the usher, "there's offices all round us here. If you don't want to go back by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've sorted out my report, then I'll be glad to go back with you again." "No, no," said K., "I will not wait and you must come with me now." K. had still not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself, and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that he noticed it. A young woman, probably summoned by the loudness of K.'s voice, entered and asked, "What is it the gentleman wants?" In the darkness behind her there was also a man approaching. K. looked at the usher. He had, after all, said that no-one would take any notice of K., and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few and everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as to why he was there. The only understandable and acceptable thing to say was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date of his next hearing, but this was an explanation he did not want to give, especially as it was not true - he had only come out of curiosity. Or else, an explanation even less usable, he could say that he wanted to ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on the outside. And it did seem that he had been quite right in this supposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed enough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind any door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if needs be, alone.</p><p>Ｋ没有多费脑子去想卫兵和走廊里的人，因为当他走过半条走廊后，发现前面的一段比较宽，两边没有门，走廊从这里开始往右拐。他问门房往这儿走是不是对头，门房点点头，Ｋ便朝右边拐去。他老走在门房前面一两步，为此他感到很不自在；在这种地方，别人很可能会把他当成一个在押的囚犯。于是，他停下好几次，等门房赶上来，可是门房却总是故意拉在后面。最后Ｋ决定结束这种尴尬场面，他说：“这个地方我已经看过了，我想走了。”“你还没有全部看呢，”门房诚恳地说。“我不想都看，”Ｋ说，他现在确实很累了。“我想走了，通往外面的门在哪里？该怎么走？”“你不至于已经迷路了吧？”门房奇怪地问，“从这儿往前走，到了转弯的地方往右拐，然后沿着走廊一直走，就到门口了。”“你也去吧，”Ｋ说，“你给我带路，这儿有许多过道，我找不到路。”“这儿只有一条路，”门房语带嗔责地说，“我不能跟你一起往回走，我得去送口信，我已经在你身上耗费掉很多时间了。”“跟我一起走吧，”Ｋ更坚决地说，好像他终于发现了门房在说谎。“别这么嚷嚷，”门房低声说，“附近到处都是办公室。如果你不愿意自己回去，那就跟我再往前走一段，或者在这儿等着，我送完信回来后，将会很高兴带你回去的。”“不，不，”Ｋ说，“我不想再等了，你现在就必须和我一起走。”Ｋ还没有来得及环顾一下四周，看看自己是在什么地方，正在这时，一扇门打开了，Ｋ回过头看见门口出现了一位姑娘。Ｋ的大嗓门引起了她的注意，她问道：“这位先生想干什么？”Ｋ在她身后较远的地方看见一个男人的身影在半明半暗中逐渐走近。Ｋ看了一眼门房。门房刚才说过，谁也不会注意Ｋ的，可是现在却有两个人冲着他来了，用不了多久，所有的官员都会走到他跟前，问他为什么呆在这里。惟一可以使人理解和接受的解释是：他是被告，想知道下次审讯是在哪一天；但是他不想这么解释，尤其因为这不符合事实，因为他到这儿来只是出于好奇，或者说，是想证实他的假设：司法制度的内部和它的外部一样令人讨厌。当然，这更难以解释。实际上，他的假设看来是对的，他不想再进行调查了，看到的东西已经足够使他沮丧了；在这种时候很可能会从这些门后走出一个高级官员来，而此时他和任何高级官员交锋都会处于不利的地位，因此他想和门房一起离开这个地方，如果需要的话，也可以一个人离开。</p></div> <div class='layout'><p>But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn't want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as he watched. But the young woman was the first to recognise that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell, she brought a chair and asked, "Would you not like to sit down?" K. sat down immediately and, in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests. "You're a little bit dizzy, aren't you?" she asked him. Her face was now close in front of him, it bore the severe expression that many young women have just when they're in the bloom of their youth. "It's nothing for you to worry about," she said, "that's nothing unusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time they come here. This is your first time is it? Yes, it's nothing unusual then. The sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy. It makes this place rather unsuitable for offices, whatever other advantages it might offer. But the air is almost impossible to breathe on days when there's a lot of business, and that's almost every day. And when you think that there's a lot of washing put out to dry here as well - and we can't stop the tenants doing that - it's not surprising you started to feel unwell. But you get used to the air alright in the end. When you're here for the second or third time you'll hardly notice how oppressive the air is. Are you feeling any better now?" K. made no answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these people by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason for feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse. The girl noticed it straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a window pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatch directly above K.'s head that led to the outside. But so much soot fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the soot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do that for himself. He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was until he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made about him the sooner that would be. But then the girl said, "You can't stay here, we're in people's way here …" K. looked at her as if to ask whose way they were impeding. "If you like, I can take you to the sick room," and turning to the man in the doorway said, "please help me". The man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go to the sick room, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led further from place to place, the further he went the more difficult it must become. So he said, "I am able to walk now," and stood up, shaking after becoming used to sitting so comfortably. But then he was unable to stay upright. "I can't manage it," he said shaking his head, and sat down again with a sigh. He remembered the usher who, despite everything, would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed to have gone long before. K. looked out between the man and the young woman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher.</p><p>他一句话也不说，一动也不动，因此很惹人注目；姑娘和门房都瞧着他，像是在盼着Ｋ身上出现某种大的变化，他们不想错过亲眼目睹这种变化的机会。Ｋ刚才远远看见的那个人现在站在过道的尽头；那人扶着低矮的门楣，踮起脚尖轻轻晃动，很像一个好奇的观众。姑娘首先发现，Ｋ的这种状态其实是由于体力稍感不支引起的；她端来一把椅子，问道：“你坐下好吗？”Ｋ立刻坐下来，胳膊肘靠在椅子扶手上，好让自己坐得更安稳些。“你有点头晕，是不是？”她问。她的脸凑近了他，她的脸部表情相当严峻，许多女人在青春初萌时脸部表情便也这么严峻。“别担心，”她说，“在这儿，这不是异常现象：差不多每个初到此地的人都有类似病症。你是第一次来吧？那好，用不着紧张。太阳照在房顶上，房梁给晒热了，所以空气闷热难忍。这个地方不适于做办公室，尽管这儿也有几个很大的优点。这儿空气污浊，特别是当这儿等候接见的当事人很多的时候更是如此，简直叫人透不过气来；而几乎每天都有许多当事人在这儿等待。如果你再想想，各种各样的衣服洗干净后都要拿到这儿来晾干——你不能禁止住户们洗他们的脏衣服——你就不会因为有点头晕而觉得奇怪了。久而久之会习惯的。你只要再来一两次，就不会觉得透不过气来了。你现在是不是觉得好点了？”Ｋ没有回答，他为自己突然头昏眼花，在这些人面前出了洋相而感到痛苦和羞愧；另外，虽然他现在已经知道头晕的原因，但并没有觉得好受些，反而更加难受了。姑娘马上看出了这点，她拿过那根支在墙上的，末端带有铁钩的木棍，用它把位于Ｋ头顶上方的天窗略微打开了一点，好让新鲜空气进来；她以这种方式帮了Ｋ的忙。可是，大量煤烟却随之冒了进来，她不得不立即把天窗重新关上，用自己的手帕把Ｋ的双手揩干净，因为Ｋ已经虚弱得不能照顾自己了。他真想在这儿安安静静地坐一会儿，等体力恢复后再走，这些人越少来麻烦他，他的体力就会恢复得越快。可是，姑娘却说：“你不能呆在这儿，我们在这儿挡了人家的路。”Ｋ露出疑问的神色，看了四周一眼，想弄明白自己到底怎么挡了人家的路。“如果你愿意的话，我可以把你带到病房里去。请帮帮忙，”她对站在门口的那人说，后者马上就走了过来。但是Ｋ不想到病房里去，尤其不愿意被人带到一个更远的地方去，走得越远，对他越不利。“我现在完全可以自己走了，”他刚说完，就从舒适的椅子上站起身来；刚才他在椅子上坐得很适意，所以乍一站起来，两腿直发颤，无法站直。“看来还不行，”他摇摇头说，叹息了一声，重新坐下。他想到了门房；虽然他很虚弱，门房倒照样可以很容易地把他带出去，可是门房好像早就不见了。Ｋ凝视着姑娘和他前面那人中间的那块地方，但是连门房的影子也没看见。</p></div> "<div class='layout'><p>""I think,"" said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long, sharply tailored points, ""the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would most prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices altogether."" ""That's right,"" exclaimed K., with such joy that he nearly interrupted what the man was saying, ""I'm sure that'll make me feel better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need is a little support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's not such a long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the stairs for a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like this at all, I'm surprised at it myself. I also work in an office and I'm quite used to office air, but here it seems to be too strong, you've said so yourselves. So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a little, I'm feeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up by myself."" And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for the two of them to take him by the arms.他一句话也不说，一动也不动，因此很惹人注目；姑娘和门房都瞧着他，像是在盼着Ｋ身上出现某种大的变化，他们不想错过亲眼目睹这种变化的机会。Ｋ刚才远远看见的那个人现在站在过道的尽头；那人扶着低矮的门楣，踮起脚尖轻轻晃动，很像一个好奇的观众。姑娘首先发现，Ｋ的这种状态其实是由于体力稍感不支引起的；她端来一把椅子，问道：“你坐下好吗？”Ｋ立刻坐下来，胳膊肘靠在椅子扶手上，好让自己坐得更安稳些。“你有点头晕，是不是？”她问。她的脸凑近了他，她的脸部表情相当严峻，许多女人在青春初萌时脸部表情便也这么严峻。“别担心，”她说，“在这儿，这不是异常现象：差不多每个初到此地的人都有类似病症。你是第一次来吧？那好，用不着紧张。太阳照在房顶上，房梁给晒热了，所以空气闷热难忍。这个地方不适于做办公室，尽管这儿也有几个很大的优点。这儿空气污浊，特别是当这儿等候接见的当事人很多的时候更是如此，简直叫人透不过气来；而几乎每天都有许多当事人在这儿等待。如果你再想想，各种各样的衣服洗干净后都要拿到这儿来晾干——你不能禁止住户们洗他们的脏衣服——你就不会因为有点头晕而觉得奇怪了。久而久之会习惯的。你只要再来一两次，就不会觉得透不过气来了。你现在是不是觉得好点了？”Ｋ没有回答，他为自己突然头昏眼花，在这些人面前出了洋相而感到痛苦和羞愧；另外，虽然他现在已经知道头晕的原因，但并没有觉得好受些，反而更加难受了。姑娘马上看出了这点，她拿过那根支在墙上的，末端带有铁钩的木棍，用它把位于Ｋ头顶上方的天窗略微打开了一点，好让新鲜空气进来；她以这种方式帮了Ｋ的忙。可是，大量煤烟却随之冒了进来，她不得不立即把天窗重新关上，用自己的手帕把Ｋ的双手揩干净，因为Ｋ已经虚弱得不能照顾自己了。他真想在这儿安安静静地坐一会儿，等体力恢复后再走，这些人越少来麻烦他，他的体力就会恢复得越快。可是，姑娘却说：“你不能呆在这儿，我们在这儿挡了人家的路。”Ｋ露出疑问的神色，看了四周一眼，想弄明白自己到底怎么挡了人家的路。“如果你愿意的话，我可以把你带到病房里去。请帮帮忙，”她对站在门口的那人说，后者马上就走了过来。但是Ｋ不想到病房里去，尤其不愿意被人带到一个更远的地方去，走得越远，对他越不利。“我现在完全可以自己走了，”他刚说完，就从舒适的椅子上站起身来；刚才他在椅子上坐得很适意，所以乍一站起来，两腿直发颤，无法站直。“看来还不行，”他摇摇头说，叹息了一声，重新坐下。他想到了门房；虽然他很虚弱，门房倒照样可以很容易地把他带出去，可是门房好像早就不见了。Ｋ凝视着姑娘和他前面那人中间的那块地方，但是连门房的影子也没看见。
?</p><p>“我想，”那人说；他衣冠楚楚，还穿着一件十分时髦的灰颜色背心，背心的下襟是两个细长的尖角，“这位先生感到头晕是因为这儿空气不好的缘故，最好的办法是——他可能也最希望这样——别把他带到病房里去，而是带他离开这些办公室。”“对！”Ｋ大声说道，他兴奋得立即打断了那人的话，“那我立刻就会好的，肯定会好的；何况我并不是真的那么虚弱，只要有人稍微扶我一把就行了。我不会给你们添很多麻烦的，也用不着走远，只要扶我到门口就行了；然后我自己在楼梯上坐一会儿，体力马上就会恢复，因为我一般没这种病，这次连我自己也莫名其妙。我也是一个办事员，对办公室里的空气早已习惯；但是这里的空气坏得确实令人不能忍受，刚才你们自己也这么说。好吧，你们愿意行个好，让我靠着你们吗？我一站起来就头昏眼花，脑袋直打转。”他抬起手臂，以便让他俩搀着他走。</p></div>" <div class='layout'><p>The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud. "There, you see," he said to the girl, "I was quite right. The gentleman is only unwell here, and not in general." The young woman smiled too, but lightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her fingers as if he had allowed himself too much fun with K. "So what do you think, then?" said the man, still laughing, "I really do want to lead the gentleman out of here." "That's alright, then," said the girl, briefly inclining her charming head. "Don't worry too much about him laughing," said the girl to K., who had become unhappy once more and stared quietly in front of himself as if needing no further explanation. "This gentleman - may I introduce you?" - (the man gave his permission with a wave of the hand) - "so, this gentleman's job is to give out information. He gives all the information they need to people who are waiting, as our court and its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked for quite a lot. He has an answer for every question, you can try him out if you feel like it. But that's not his only distinction, his other distinction is his elegance of dress. We, that's to say all of us who work in the offices here, we decided that the information-giver would have to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the litigants and he's the first one they meet, so he needs to give a dignified first impression. The rest of us I'm afraid, as you can see just by looking at me, dress very badly and old-fashioned; and there's not much point in spending much on clothes anyway, as we hardly ever leave the offices, we even sleep here. But, as I said, we decided that the information-giver would have to have nice clothes. As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect, and they would get them for us, we had a collection - some of the litigants contributed too - and bought him these lovely clothes and some others besides. So everything would be ready for him to give a good impression, except that he spoils it again by laughing and frightening people." "That's how it is," said the man, mocking her, "but I don't understand why it is that you're explaining all our intimate facts to the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're pressing them on him, as I'm sure he's not all interested. Just look at him sitting there, it's clear he's occupied with his own affairs." K. just did not feel like contradicting him.. The girl's intention may have been good, perhaps she was under instructions to distract him or to give him the chance to collect himself, but the attempt had not worked. "I had to explain to him why you were laughing," said the girl. "I suppose it was insulting." "I think he would forgive even worse insults if I finally took him outside." K. said nothing, did not even look up, he tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was even what suited him best. But suddenly he felt the information-giver's hand on one arm and the young woman's hand on the other. "Up you get then, weakling," said the information-giver. "Thank you both very much," said K., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided these unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support. As they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, "I must seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in a good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the truth. He isn't hard-hearted. It's not really his job to help litigants outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can see. I don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like to be helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to give the impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. It makes me quite sad." "Would you not like to sit down here a while?" asked the information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just in front of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier. K. felt almost ashamed to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by the information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead. But the defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood there humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for being there. The information-giver looked past him. "I know," he said, "that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway, I thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I've got plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here." "There's no need to be so apologetic," said the information-giver, "it's very commendable for you to be so attentive. You are taking up space here when you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as you like. When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their cases one learns to show patience with people like you. Do sit down." "He's very good with the litigants," whispered the girl. K. nodded, but started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, "Would you not like to sit down here a while?" "No," said K., "I don't want to rest." He had said that as decisively as he could, but in fact it would have done him a lot of good to sit down. It was as if he were suffering sea-sickness. He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea, as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from the depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as if the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it rising and sinking. It made the calmness of the girl and the man leading him all the more incomprehensible. He was at their mercy, if they let go of him he would fall like a board. Their little eyes glanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually being carried. He finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did not understand them, all he heard was a noise that filled all the space and through which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding, like a siren. "Louder," he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at having to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough, even if it had been, for him, incomprehensible. At last, a draught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in the wall in front of him, and next to him he heard someone say, "First he says he wants to go, and then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the way out and he doesn't move." K. became aware that he was standing in front of the way out, and that the young woman had opened the door. It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at once, and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one of the stairs and took his leave there of his companions, who bowed to him. "Thank you very much," he repeated, shook their hands once more and did not let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the comparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the offices. They were hardly able to reply, and the young woman might even have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely fast. K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of a pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair - the information-giver must have thrown it down there - and then he ran down the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly frightened him. His normally sturdy state of health had never prepared him for surprises such as this. Did his body want to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old one with such little effort? He did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next time he had the chance, but whatever he did - and this was something on which he could advise himself - he wanted to spend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one.</p><p>但是，那人没有回答Ｋ的请求，他的手仍然安安逸逸地插在口袋里，他笑了起来。“你瞧，”他对姑娘说，“我说得多对啊，这位先生只是在这儿才感到不舒服，在别的地方没事。”姑娘也笑了，但是她用手指尖轻轻碰了碰那人的手臂，好像他这样跟Ｋ开玩笑有点过头了。“嗬，哎哟，”那人说，他还在笑，“我搀这位先生到门口去，当然愿意！”“那好，”姑娘说，她那漂亮的脑袋微微侧向一边。“别对他的傻笑介意，”她对Ｋ说，Ｋ又陷入无名哀伤中，看来并不期待得到解释，“这位先生——我可以把你介绍给他吗？”（那位先生挥挥手，表示同意。）“好吧，这位先生是代表问讯处的。他解答人们提出的任何问题，公众不大清楚我们的诉讼程序，经常提出大量问题。对于每一个问题他都有一个答案，如果你愿意的话，你可以向他提个问题试试。除此以外，他还有一个惹人注目的地方，这就是他的衣服很时髦，这是我们——也就是说全体工作人员——决定的。由于问讯处的职员总要跟人们打交道，总是第一个看见他们，所以他的衣着必须时髦，以便给人们留下良好的初次印象。除了他以外，我们这些人都穿得很差，式样很陈旧，这点你可能一看见我就发现了，很遗憾，我不得不这么说；话再说回来，把钱花在穿着上没有多大意思，因为我们几乎不出办公室，甚至睡在办公室里。但是，正像我已经说过的那样，他却必须讲究穿戴。可是管理处在这方面有些怪，居然不给他提供服装，于是我们只好募捐——有的当事人也捐了钱——我们给他买了这套衣服和其它服装。如果只是为了造成一个好印象，那他现在不需要任何别的东西了。然而他的狂笑却吓退了人们，弄糟了一切。”“确实如此，”那位先生冷嘲热讽地说，“不过我确实搞不明白，小姐，你为什么要向这位先生透露我们的内部秘密，或者说得更确切一点，你为什么硬把这些秘密灌进他的耳朵中，因为他根本不想听。你看，他显然正忙于思考自己的事哩。”Ｋ不想反驳，姑娘的用意无疑是好的，她大概想让Ｋ散散心，或者给他提供一个振作起来的机会，仅此而已；但她走的路子不对。“怎么啦，我得向他解释一下你为什么笑，”姑娘说，“它听起来让人觉得是受侮辱。”“我想，只要我愿意带他离开这儿，再厉害的侮辱他也能宽容。”Ｋ什么也没说，甚至没有向上看一眼，听凭他们两人议论他，好像他是一个没有生命的物体似的；说实在的，他倒真希望成为一个没有生命的物体。突然他觉得那人的手挎起他的一只胳膊，姑娘的手则搀着他的另一只胳膊。“起来，你这个软骨头，”那人说。“谢谢你们两位，”Ｋ喜出望外地说，他慢慢站起身来，把这两个陌生人的手移到他觉得最需要搀扶的位置。“你可能会以为，”当他们走进过道时，姑娘在Ｋ耳边温柔地说，“我尽量想把问讯处的职员说得好些；不过，你可以相信我，关于他我只是如实禀告而已。他的心并不冷酷。他没有义务扶着病人离开这儿，可是他这样做了，这是你现在可以看见的。也许我们的心肠都不坏，我们乐意帮助所有人；然而因为我们是法院的职员，人们很容易根据表面现象断定我们的心肠很狠，不愿意帮助人。这真使我不安。”“你不想在这儿坐一会儿吗？”问讯处的职员问。他们现在已来到了外面的大走廊中，面前正好坐着刚才曾经和Ｋ讲过话的那个人。Ｋ在那人面前几乎有些难为情，因为当时他在那人面前站得笔直，现在却有两个人扶着他，他的帽子由问讯处的职员拿着，他的头发蓬乱，披散在汗水淋淋的额头上。可是那人好像什么也没发现，他低三下四地在问讯处职员面前站起来（问讯处职员目不转睛地瞪着他），一心想解释自己为什么呆在这里。“我知道，”他说，“今天还不能就我的宣誓书作出决定。但是我还是来了，我想我也可以在这儿等待，今天是星期天嘛，我有的是时间，我在这儿不打扰任何人。”“你用不着为自己辩解，”问讯处职员回答道，“你的焦虑是对的；你在这里额外地占了地方，我承认；不过，到目前为止，你还没有碍着我的事，所以我决不阻止你尽可能及时了解你的案子的进展情况。可耻地玩忽职责的人见得多了，人们也就学会忍受你这样的人了。你可以坐下。”“他多么善于和被告们讲话啊！”姑娘低声说。Ｋ点点头，但是他突然惊跳起来，因为问讯处职员问他：“你想在这儿坐一会儿吗？”“不，”Ｋ说，“我不想休息。”他尽可能用坚决的口气说了这句话，虽然他实际上很希望能坐一坐，他觉得像是晕船似的。他似乎在波浪翻滚的大海里行船，海水好像拍击着过道两边的墙壁，过道深处仿佛传来了波涛拍岸发出的哗哗声，过道本身好像在颠簸，在回转，在过道两旁等着的当事人似乎也在随着过道沉浮。因此，护送他的姑娘和问讯处职员的镇静简直令人难以理解。他掌握在他们手中，如果他们让他走，他就会像一截木头似地跌倒。他们用目光敏锐的小眼睛打量着四周，Ｋ知道他们正在正常地继续向前走，可他自己却没有走，现在几乎是被他们架着一步步往前挪。最后他发现他们在对他讲话，但是他听不清楚他们讲的是什么，他只听见挤在这儿的人发出的喧闹声，其它什么也听不见。人声中有一个声音很尖，持久不息，好像是鸣汽笛。“声音响一些，”他垂着头低声说，他觉得难为情，因为他知道，他们讲话的声音已经够响了，而他却仍然听不清他们在讲什么。接着，他前面的墙好像裂成了两半，一股新鲜空气终于朝他涌了过来；他听见身边有一个声音说：“他开头想走，后来虽然你向他讲了一百次，告诉他们就在他前面，可是他却一动也不动。”Ｋ看见自己正站在大门口，门是姑娘刚才打开的。他的力气好像一下子就恢复了。他想先尝尝自由的乐趣，便伸出脚去，踏上一级楼梯，在那儿与搀他到这儿来的两个人告别，他们低着头听他讲话。“十分感谢，”他反复说了几次，接着又一而再、再而三地和他们握手，直到他看出，他们确实只习惯于呼吸办公室的空气，一接触到从楼梯口涌进来的比较新鲜一点的空气就不舒服时，才离开他们。他们简直连回答他的力气也没有了。如果Ｋ不匆匆把门关上的话，姑娘很可能会晕倒在地。Ｋ又站了一会儿，掏出口袋里的镜子，把头发理理好，捡起掉在下面那级楼梯上的帽子——可能是问讯处职员扔在那儿的——然后便迈着轻快的步子，大步朝楼下走去，连他自己也对这种反应感到有些害怕了。他那往常很结实的身体从来没有使他出过这种洋相。也许体内正酝酿着一次剧烈的变革，让他再经受一次考验吧！以前的那些考验他都轻而易举地经受住了。他并没有完全抛弃一有机会便去找医生看看的念头，不管怎么说，他已经决定今后要把每星期天上午的时间花在更有意义的事情上——在这点上，他还是可以给自己出主意的。</p></div> ﻿
