<p>16 The Renaissance</p>

<p>16 文艺复兴</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>……O divine lineage in mortal guise……</p>

<p> ……啊！藏在凡俗身躯里的神明子孙哪…… </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>It was just twelve when Sophie reached Joanna's front gate, out of breath with running. Joanna was standing in the front yard outside her family's yellow house.</p>

<p>苏菲气喘吁吁地跑到乔安家的前门时，刚好过了十二点。乔安正站在他们那栋小黄屋前面的院子里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You've been gone for five hours!" Joanna said sharply.</p>

<p>“你去了快十个小时了！”乔安提高了嗓门。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie shook her head.</p>

<p>苏菲摇摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No, I've been gone for more than a thousand years."</p>

<p>“不，我去了一千多年了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Where on earth have you been? You're crazy. Your mom called half an hour ago."</p>

<p>“你究竟到哪里去了？你疯了吗？你妈妈半小时前打电话来。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What did you tell her?"</p>

<p>“你怎么跟她说？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I said you were at the drugstore. She said would you call her when you got back. But you should have seen my mom and dad when they came in with hot chocolate and rolls at ten this morning ... and your bed was empty."</p>

<p>“我说你到药局去了，她说请你回来时打个电话给她。不过今天早上十点我爸和我妈端着热巧克力和面包进房里来，却发现你的床是空的。你真该看看他们脸上的表情。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What did you say to them?"</p>

<p>“你怎么跟他们说？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It was really embarrassing. I told them you went home because we got mad at each other."</p>

<p>“我很尴尬。我告诉他们说我们吵了一架，你就跑回家了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So we'd better hurry up and be friends again. And we have to make sure your parents don't talk to my mom for a few days. Do you think we can do that?"</p>

<p>“这么说，我们最好赶快言归于好，而且这几天内我们不能让你爸妈和我妈说话。你想我们能不能办得到？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Joanna shrugged. Just then her father came around the corner with a wheelbarrow. He had a pair of coveralls on and was busy clearing up last year's leaves and twigs.</p>

<p>乔安耸耸肩。就在这个时候，乔安的爸爸从角落里走过来，手里推着一辆独轮车。他身穿工人装，正忙着清扫去年掉下来的最后一些落叶和树枝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Aha--so you're friends again, I see. Well, there's not so much as a single leaf left on the basement steps now."</p>

<p>“哈，你们和好了，你们看，我把地下室台阶上的落叶扫得干干净净，一片也不剩。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Fine," said Sophie. "So perhaps we can have our hot chocolate there instead of in bed."</p>

<p>“不错。”苏菲答道：“现在我们是不是可以在这边喝热巧克力了？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Joanna's dad gave a forced laugh, but Joanna gasped. Verbal exchanges had always been more robust in Sophie's family than at the more well-to-do home of Mr. Ingebrigtsen, the financial adviser, and his wife.</p>

<p>乔安的爸爸勉强笑了一下，乔安则吓了一跳。乔安的爸爸是一位财务顾问，因此乔安的家境比苏菲好，而他们家人彼此之间讲话是不像苏菲家那样直来直往的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I'm sorry, Joanna, but I felt I ought to take part in this cover-up operation as well."</p>

<p>“对不起，乔安，我只是想我该帮你圆谎才对。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Are you going to tell me about it?"</p>

<p>“你要不要告诉我发生了什么事？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Sure, if you walk home with me. Because it's not for the ears of financial advisers or overgrown Barbie dolls."</p>

<p>“当然要啦！如果你陪我回家的话。因为这些事是不能让什么财务顾问呀、超龄的芭比娃娃呀之类的人听的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's a rotten thing to say! I suppose you think a rocky marriage that drives one of the partners away to sea is better?"</p>

<p>“说这种烂话！有的人结了婚，另外一半只好去出海，这种不稳定的婚姻我看也不见得比较好吧！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Probably not. But I hardly slept last night. And another thing, I've begun to wonder whether Hilde can see everything we do."</p>

<p>“也许是吧！不管怎么说，我昨晚几乎都没睡。还有，我开始好奇席德是不是能看到我们所做的每一件事情。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>They began to walk toward Clover Close.</p>

<p>她们开始朝苜蓿巷走去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You mean she might have second sight?"</p>

<p>“你的意思是说她也许有第三只眼睛？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Maybe. Maybe not."</p>

<p>“也许是，也许不是。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Joanna was clearly not enthusiastic about all this secrecy.</p>

<p>很明显的，乔安对这个谜团并不热衷。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But that doesn't explain why her father sent a lot of crazy postcards to an empty cabin in the woods."</p>

<p>“不过这并不能解释她爸爸为什么会寄那么多莫名其妙的明信片到树林里一座空着的木屋去呀！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I admit that is a weak spot."</p>

<p>“我承认这一点是不太能说得通。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Do you want to tell me where you have been?"</p>

<p>“你要告诉我你到哪里去了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>So she did. Sophie told her everything, about the mysterious philosophy course as well. She made Joanna swear to keep everything secret.</p>

<p>于是，苏菲就一五一十地告诉了乔安，连同那神秘哲学课程的事。她要乔安发誓绝对不能把这个秘密告诉别人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>They walked for a long time without speaking. </p>

<p>她们继续向前走，有很长一段时间都没有说话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>As they approached Clover Close, Joanna said, "I don't like it."</p>

<p>当他们走到苜蓿巷时，乔安说：“我不怎么喜欢这件事。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She stopped at Sophie's gate and turned to go home again.</p>

<p>她在苏菲家的门口停下来，转身准备回家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Nobody asked you to like it. But philosophy is not a harmless party game. It's about who we are and where we come from. Do you think we learn enough about that at school?"</p>

<p>“没有人要你喜欢。不过哲学不是一个无伤大雅的团体游戏，它跟我们是谁、从何而来这些问题有关。你认为这方面我们在学校学的够多吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Nobody can answer questions like that anyway."</p>

<p>“可是不管怎样都没有人能回答那些问题呀！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, but we don't even learn to ask them!"</p>

<p>“没错，但甚至没有人告诉我们应该提出这些问题！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Lunch was on the table when Sophie walked into the kitchen. Nothing was said about her not having called from Joanna's.</p>

<p>苏菲走进厨房时，午饭已经摆在桌上了。关于她没有从乔安家打电话回家这件事，妈妈也没说什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>After lunch Sophie announced that she was going to take a nap. She admitted she had hardly slept at Joanna's house, which was not at all unusual at a sleepover.</p>

<p>午饭后，苏菲宣布她要上楼睡午觉，她老实跟妈妈说她在乔安家几乎都没睡。不过话说回来，女孩子在一起过夜时，一整个晚上不睡觉也是常有的事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Before getting into bed she stood in front of the big brass mirror which now hung on her wall. At first she only saw her own white and exhausted face. But then-- behind her own face, the faintest suggestion of another face seemed to appear. Sophie took one or two deep breaths. It was no good starting to imagine things.</p>

<p>在上床前，她站在墙上那面大铜镜前看着，起先只看到自己苍白疲倦的脸，但后来，在她的脸后面，似乎隐隐约约有另外一张浮现，苏菲做了一两下深呼吸。她已经开始有幻觉了，这可不大妙。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She studied the sharp contours of her own pale face framed by that impossible hair which defied any style but nature's own. But beyond that face was the apparition of another girl. </p>

<p>她仔细审视着自己那张轮廓分明苍白的脸，以及脸四周那一头做不出任何发型的难缠的头发。但在那张脸之外却浮现了另外一个女孩的幽灵。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Suddenly the other girl began to wink frantically with both eyes, as if to signal that she was really in there on the other side. The apparition lasted only a few seconds. Then she was gone.</p>

<p>突然间，那个女孩疯狂地眨着双眼，仿佛是在向苏菲做信号，说她的确在那儿。这个幽灵出现的时间只有几秒钟，然后便消失了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie sat down on the edge of the bed. She had absolutely no doubt that it was Hilde she had seen in the mirror. She had caught a glimpse of her picture on a school I.D. in the major's cabin. It must have been the same girl she had seen in the mirror.</p>

<p>苏菲坐在床沿。她万分确信镜子里的女孩就是席德。她曾经在少校的小木屋内放着的一份成绩单上看过席德的照片，刚才她在镜子里看到的一定就是她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Wasn't it odd, how she always experienced mysterious things like this when she was dead tired. It meant that afterward she always had to ask herself whether it really had happened.</p>

<p>为什么她总是在疲倦至极的时候遇见这类令人毛骨悚然的事呢？这不是很奇怪吗？所以，每次事情发生后，她总得问问自己那是否是真的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie laid her clothes on the chair and crawled into bed. She fell asleep at once and had a strangely vivid dream.</p>

<p>苏菲把衣服放在椅子上，便爬上了床。她立刻睡着了，并且作了一个栩栩如生的梦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She dreamed she was standing in a large garden that sloped down to a red boathouse. On the dock behind it sat a young fair-haired girl gazing out over the water. Sophie walked down and sat beside her. But the girl seemed not to notice her. Sophie introduced herself. "I'm Sophie," she said. But the other girl could apparently neither see nor hear her. Suddenly Sophie heard a voice calling, "Hilde!" At once the girl jumped up from where she was sitting and ran as fast as she could up to the house. She couldn't have been deaf or blind after all. A middle-aged man came striding from the house toward her. He was wearing a khaki uniform and a blue beret. </p>

<p>她梦见自己站在一座大花园中。园里有一道山坡向下通往一座船库。船库后面的平台上坐着一个年轻的金发女孩，正在眺望着大海。苏菲走下去，坐在她身旁，但那女孩却似乎没有察觉她的到来。苏菲开始自我介绍：“我叫苏菲，”她说。但这个女孩显然既没看到她的人，也没听到她说话。“你显然又聋又瞎。”苏菲说。那女孩还是充耳不闻。突然间苏菲听到一个声音在喊：“席德！”那女孩立刻跳起来，向船库的方向飞奔。看来她既不聋也不瞎。此时一名中年男子从船库大步向她走来。他身穿卡其布制服，头戴蓝扁帽。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The girl threw her arms around his neck and he swung her around a few times. Sophie noticed a little gold crucifix on a chain lying on the dock where the girl had been sitting. She picked it up and held it in her hand. Then she woke up.</p>

<p>女孩展开双臂抱住他的脖子，他则将她抱起，转了几圈。这时，苏菲在女孩原先所坐之处看到一条小小的金色十字架链子。她将它捡起来，拿在手中，然后便醒了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie looked at the clock. She had been asleep for two hours. </p>

<p>苏菲看看时钟，她已经睡子两个小时。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She sat up in bed, thinking about the strange dream. It was so real that she felt as if she had actually lived the experience. She was equally sure that the house and the dock really existed somewhere. Surely it resembled the picture she had seen hanging in the major's cabin? Anyway, there was no doubt at all that the girl in her dream was Hilde Moller Knag and that the man was her father, home from Lebanon. In her dream he had looked a lot like Alberto Knox ...</p>

<p>她坐起来，想着这个奇怪的梦。梦境里的一切是如此栩栩如生，她觉得自己好像确实到过那里一样，她也很确定那座船库和平台确实存在于某个地方。当然，它们看起来很像是她在少校的小木屋中见过的那幅风景画。无论如何，她梦中的那个女孩无疑必是席德，而那个男人则是她的爸爸，刚从黎巴嫩回来。在梦中，他的样子看起来很像艾伯特。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>As Sophie stood up and began to tidy her bed, she found a gold crucifix on a chain under her pillow. On the back of the crucifix there were three letters engraved: HMK.</p>

<p>苏菲起床开始整理床铺时，在枕头下发现一条金色的十字架链子。十字架的背面刻着席德几个字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>This was not the first time Sophie had dreamed she found a treasure. But this was definitely the first time she had brought it back from the dream.</p>

<p>这并不是苏菲第一次梦见自己捡到贵重的东西，但毫无疑问这是第一次那样东西从梦里跑了出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Damn!" she said aloud.</p>

<p>“去你的！”她大声说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She was so mad that she opened the closet door and hurled the delicate crucifix up onto the top shelf with the silk scarf, the white stocking, and the postcards from Lebanon.</p>

<p>她生气地打开橱柜的门，把那条精致的十字架链子丢到最上面一格，跟丝巾、白袜子和从黎巴嫩寄来的明信片放在一起。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The next morning Sophie woke up to a big breakfast of hot rolls, orange juice, eggs, and vegetable salad. It was not often that her mother was up before Sophie on a Sunday morning. When she was, she liked to fix a solid meal for Sophie.</p>

<p>面授课程第二天早晨，苏菲醒来时，妈妈已经弄好了一顿可口的早餐，有热面包、橘子汁、蛋和蔬菜沙拉。通常星期天早晨妈妈很少比苏菲先起床，而每次她先起床时，总是会弄好一顿丰盛的早餐再叫醒苏菲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>While they were eating, Mom said, "There's a strange dog in the garden. It's been sniffing round the old hedge all morning. I can't imagine what it's doing here, can you?"</p>

<p>她们吃着早餐时，妈妈说：“花园里有一只很奇怪的狗，整个早上都在老树篱旁边嗅来嗅去。我实在不知道它在那儿干什么，你呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Yes!" Sophie burst out, and at once regretted it.</p>

<p>“我知道！”苏菲脱口而出，随即又后悔了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Has it been here before?"</p>

<p>“它以前来过吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie had already left the table and gone into the living room to look out of the window facing the large garden. It was just as she thought.</p>

<p>这时苏菲已经离开餐桌，走到客厅向着花园的那扇窗户往外看。果然不出她所料。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Hermes was lying in front of the secret entrance to her den.</p>

<p>汉密士正躺在密洞的人口前。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>What should she say? She had no time to think of anything before her mother came and stood beside her.</p>

<p>她该怎么跟妈妈说呢？她还来不及想出什么借口时，妈妈已经走过来，站在她身边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Did you say it had been here before?" she asked.</p>

<p>“你刚才说它以前来过这儿？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I expect it buried a bone there and now it's come to fetch its treasure. Dogs have memories too ..."</p>

<p>“我想它大概是以前在那里埋了一根骨头，现在想把它挖出来。你知道，狗也有记性的……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Maybe you're right, Sophie. You're the animal psychologist in the family."</p>

<p>“大概是吧，苏菲。你是我们家的动物心理学家。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie thought feverishly.</p>

<p>苏菲急切的搜寻着借口。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I'll take it home," she said.</p>

<p>“我带它回家好了。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You know where it lives, then?"</p>

<p>“你知道它住哪里吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>苏菲耸耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's probably got an address on its collar."</p>

<p>“项圈上也许会有地址吧！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>A couple of minutes later Sophie was on her way down the garden. When Hermes caught sight of her he came lolloping toward her, wagging his tail and jumping up to her.</p>

<p>两三分钟后，苏菲已经走到了花园。汉密士一看到她两步跑了过来，摇了摇尾巴，扑向苏菲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Good boy, Hermes!" said Sophie.</p>

<p>“乖狗狗！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She knew her mother was watching from the window. She prayed he would not go through the hedge. But the dog dashed toward the gravel path in front of the house, streaked across the front yard, and jumped up to the gate.</p>

<p>她知道妈妈正在窗户那边看着他们。她内心暗自祈祷汉密士不要钻进树篱。还好，它只是冲向屋前的石子路，飞快地跑过前院，奔向大门。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>When they had shut the gate behind them, Hermes continued to run a few yards in front of Sophie. It was a long way. Sophie and Hermes were not the only ones out for a Sunday walk. Whole families were setting off for the day. Sophie felt a pang of envy.</p>

<p>大门关上后，汉密士继续在苏菲前面跑了几码。这段路程颇远。由于是星期天的上午，路上有一些人在散步。眼看别人全家一起共度周末，苏菲真是羡慕极了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>From time to time Hermes would run off and sniff at another dog or at something interesting by a garden hedge, but as soon as Sophie called "Here, boy!" he would come back to her at once.</p>

<p>一路上，汉密士不时跑去嗅嗅别的狗或别人家花园篱笆旁边的有趣玩意儿。不过只要苏菲一叫，“狗狗，过来，它就立刻回来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>They crossed an old pasture, a large playing field, and a playground, and emerged into an area with more traffic. They continued toward the town center along a broad street with cobbled stones and streetcars. Hermes led the way across the town square and up Church Street. They came out into the Old Town, with its massive staid town houses from the turn of the century. It was almost half past one.</p>

<p>不一会儿，他们已经走过了一座老旧的牧场、一座大运动场和一个游乐场，进入了人车较多的地区。他们继续沿着一条铺着圆石并有电车往来的大街向市中心走。到了市中心时，汉密士引导苏菲穿越市中心广场，走到教会街上。这里属于旧市区，四周都是十九世纪末、二十世纪初时兴建的平凡单调的大宅子。时间已经将近下午一点半了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Now they were on the other side of town. Sophie had not been there very often. Once when she was little, she remembered, she had been taken to visit an old aunt in one of these streets.</p>

<p>现在他们已经到了市区的另外一边。这里苏菲并不常来。她记得小时候有一次爸妈曾带她到这里的一条街上拜访一位年老的姨妈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Eventually they reached a little square between several old houses. It was called New Square, although it all looked very old. But then the whole town was old; it had been founded way back in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>最后他们走到位于几栋旧宅子之间的一座小广场。这座广场虽然看起来非常古老，但却名为“新广场”。不过话说回来，这整座城镇历史已经很悠久了，它兴建的年代可以远溯到中世纪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Hermes walked toward No. 14, where he stood still and waited for Sophie to open the door. Her heart began to beat faster.</p>

<p>汉密士走向第十四号房屋，然后便停下来不动，等着苏菲开门。苏菲心跳开始加快。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Inside the front door there were a number of green mailboxes attached to a panel. Sophie noticed a postcard hanging from one of the mailboxes in the top row. It had a stamped message from the mailman across it to the effect that the addressee was unknown.</p>

<p>进了前门，苏菲看到一块嵌板上钉着几个绿色的信箱，最上面一排有一个信箱口露出—张明信片。上面有邮局所盖的“地址详”的印章。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The addressee was Hilde Moller Knag, 14 New Square. It was postmarked June 15. That was not for two weeks, but the mailman had obviously not noticed that.</p>

<p>明信片上的地址写着“新广场十四号，席德收”，日期是六月十五日。事实上还有两个星期才到六月十五日，但邮差显然没有注意到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie took the card down and read it:</p>

<p>苏菲把明信片取下来看： </p></div>


<div class="lettle">
<div class='layout'>
<p style="text-indent:0em">Dear Hilde, </p>
<p style="text-indent:0em">亲爱的席德：</p>
</div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Now Sophie is coming to the philosopher's house. She will soon be fifteen, but you were fifteen yesterday. Or is it today, Hilde? If it is today, it must be late, then. But our watches do not always agree. One generation ages while another generation is brought forth. In the meantime history takes its course. Have you ever thought that the history of Europe is like a human life? Antiquity is like the childhood of Europe. Then come the interminable Middle Ages--Europe's schoolday. But at last comes the Renaissance; the long school-day is over. Europe comes of age in a burst of exuberance and a thirst for life. We could say that the Renaissance is Europe's fifteenth birthday! It is mid-June, my child, and it is wonderful to be alive!</p>

<p>现在苏菲已经到哲学家的家里来了。她很快就要满十五岁了，但你昨天就满十五了。还是今天呢？如果是今天的话，那么信到的大迟了。不过我们两个的时间并不一定一致。下一代出来后，上一代就老了。历史就这样发展下去。你有没有想过欧洲的历史就像一个人的一生？古代就像欧洲的童年，然后到了漫长的中世纪，这是欧洲的学生时期。最后终于到了文艺复兴时期，此时，漫长的求学时期结束了。欧洲成年了，充满了旺盛的活力以及对生命的渴望。我们可以说文艺复兴时期是欧洲的十五岁生日！现在是六月中旬了，我的孩子，活着的感觉真好，不是吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>P.S. Sorry to hear you lost your gold crucifix. You must learn to take better care of your things. Love, Dad--who is just around the corner.</p>

<p>P．S：很遗憾你丢了那条金十字架链子。你得学习照管自己的东西才行。爸爸就在你的身旁。爱你的老爸。</p></div>
</div>


<div class='layout'>

<p>Hermes was already on his way up the stairs. Sophie took the postcard with her and followed. She had to run to keep up with him; he was wagging his tail delightedly. They passed the second, third, and fourth stories. From then on there was only an attic staircase. Were they going up to the roof? Hermes clambered on up the stairs and stopped outside a narrow door, which he scratched at with his paw.</p>

<p>汉密士已经开始上楼了。苏菲拿了明信片，跟着它走。她必须跑才能赶上它。它一直快活地摇着尾巴。他们走上了二楼、三楼，到四楼后只有一道通往阁楼的楼梯。难道要上屋顶吗？汉密士沿着楼梯上去，在一扇窄门前停下来，并用爪子抓门。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie heard footsteps approaching from inside. The door opened, and there stood Alberto Knox. He had changed his clothes and was now wearing another costume. It consisted of white hose, red knee-breeches, and a yellow jacket with padded shoulders. He reminded Sophie of a joker in a deck of cards. If she was not much mistaken, this was a typical Renaissance costume.</p>

<p>苏菲听到脚步声从里面走来。门开了，艾伯特站在那儿。他已经换了服装，现在穿着另外一套衣服，包括白长袜、红膝马裤和黄色垫肩的紧身上衣。他使苏菲想起扑克牌里的小丑。如果她没记错的话，这是文艺复兴时期典型的服装。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What a clown!" Sophie exclaimed, giving him a little push so that she could go inside the apartment.</p>

<p>“你这个小丑！”苏菲喊，轻轻地推了他一把，以便走进屋里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Once again she had taken out her fear and shyness on the unfortunate philosophy teacher. Sophie's thoughts were in a turmoil because of the postcard she had found down in the hallway.</p>

<p>在恐怖、害羞的情绪交集之下，苏菲又不期然地拿她可怜的哲学老师当靶子。由于刚才在玄关处发现那张明信片，苏菲现在的思绪是一片混乱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Be calm, my child," said Alberto, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>“不要这么容易激动，孩子。”艾伯特说，一面把门关上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And here's the mail," she said, handing him the postcard as if she held him responsible for it.</p>

<p>“你看这张明信片！她说，一面把信交给他，好像他应该负责似的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto read it and shook his head.</p>

<p>艾伯特看完信后摇摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"He gets more and more audacious. I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't using us as a kind of birthday diversion for his daughter."</p>

<p>“他愈来愈无所忌惮了。说不定他是利用我们做为他女儿的生日娱乐。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>With that he tore the postcard into small pieces and threw them into the wastepaper basket.</p>

<p>说完后他将明信片撕成碎片，丢进字纸篓中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It said that Hilde has lost her crucifix," said Sophie.</p>

<p>“信上说席德丢了她的十字架。”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So I read."</p>

<p>“我看到了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And I found it, the same one, under my pillow at home. Can you understand how it got there?"</p>

<p>“那个十字架被我发现了，就是那一个，放在我家的枕头下面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto looked gravely into her eyes.</p>

<p>你知道它怎么会在那里吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It may seem alluring. But it's just a cheap trick that costs him no effort whatsoever. Let us rather concentrate on the big white rabbit that is pulled out of the universe's top hat."</p>

<p>艾伯特严肃地看着她的眼睛，“这件事看起来也许很吸引入，但只是他不费一点力气就能玩的小把戏罢了。我们还是集中精神来看那只被魔术师从宇宙的礼帽中拉出来的大白兔吧！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>They went into the living room. It was one of the most extraordinary rooms Sophie had ever seen.</p>

<p>他们进入客厅。那是苏菲所见过的最不寻常的房间之一。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto lived in a spacious attic apartment with sloping walls. A sharp light directly from the sky flooded the room from a skylight set into one of the walls. There was also another window facing the town. Through this window Sophie could look over all the roofs in the Old Town.</p>

<p>这是一间宽敞的阁楼，四边的墙壁略微倾斜。强烈的阳光透过其中一面的窗户泻满了整个房间。另外一扇窗户则开向市区，苏菲可以从这里看到旧市区里所有房子的屋顶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>But what amazed Sophie most was all the stuff the room was filled with--furniture and objects from various historical periods. There was a sofa from the thirties, an old desk from the beginning of the century, and a chair that had to be hundreds of years old. But it wasn't just the furniture. Old objects, either useful or decorative, were jumbled together on shelves and cupboards. There were old clocks and vases, mortars and retorts, knives and dolls, quill pens and bookends, octants and sextants, compasses and barometers. One entire wall was covered with books, but not the sort of books found in most bookstores. The book collection itself was a cross section of the production of many hundreds of years. On the other walls hung drawings and paintings, some from recent decades, but most of them also very old. There were a lot of old charts and maps on the walls too, and as far as Norway was concerned, they were not very accurate.</p>

<p>但是最让苏菲惊讶的还是房间里摆满了各种年代的家具器物。有一张三十年代的沙发，一张二十世纪初期的旧书桌和一把看起来有几百年历史的椅子。除了家具之外，还有各式各样古董，不管是实用的还是装饰的，统统凌乱地放在架子上或柜子里，包括古老的时钟与花瓶、研钵和蒸馏器、刀子和娃娃、羽毛笔和书挡、八分仪和六分仪、罗盘和气压计等。有一整面墙放满了书，而且都不是那些可以在书店里看到的书，出版的年代横跨数百年。另外一面墙则挂满了素描与图画，有些是最近几十年的，但大多数都是非常古老的作品。此外，每面墙上都挂有很多古老的图表与地图。从图上挪威的大小与位置看来，这些地图并不很精确。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie stood for several minutes without speaking and took everything in.</p>

<p>有好几分钟的时间，苏菲只是站在那儿，没有说话。她东张西望了一阵子，直到她从各个角度把这个房间看过为止。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What a lot of old junk you've collected," she said.</p>

<p>“你这里搜集的旧垃圾可真多！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Now then! Just think of how many centuries of history I have preserved in this room. I wouldn't exactly call it junk."</p>

<p>“你又来了。这个房间里保存的是几百年的历史文物。应该不算是垃圾吧？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Do you manage an antique shop or something?"</p>

<p>“你是开古董店的吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto looked almost pained.</p>

<p>艾伯特的表情几乎有点痛苦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We can't all let ourselves be washed away by the tide of history, Sophie. Some of us must tarry in order to gather up what has been left along the river banks."</p>

<p>“我们不能让自己被历史的浪潮冲走，总得有人收拾河岸边留下来的东西。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What an odd thing to say."</p>

<p>“这话很奇怪。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Yes, but none the less true, child. We do not live in our own time alone; we carry our history within us. Don't forget that everything you see in this room was once brand new. That old sixteenth-century wooden doll might have been made for a five-year-old girl's birthday. By her old grandfather, maybe... then she became a teenager, then an adult, and then she married. Maybe she had a daughter of her own and gave the doll to her. She grew old, and one day she died. </p>

<p>“是很奇怪，但却一点不假。孩子，我们并不只活在我们所属的时代里，我们身上也扛着历史。不要忘记你在这个房间内看到的每一样东西都曾经是崭新的。那个十六世纪的木娃娃也许是为了某个五岁女孩的生日做的，而制造的人也许就是她年老的祖母……然后小女孩长成了青少年，然后成年了，结婚了，也许也生了一个女儿，后来她把木娃娃传给女儿，自己则渐渐老去，有一天就死了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Although she had lived for a very long time, one day she was dead and gone. And she will never return. Actually she was only here for a short visit. But her doll--well, there it is on the shelf."</p>

<p>虽然她活了很久，但总还是难免一死，从此一去不返。事实上她只是来到人间短暂一游罢了。但是她的娃娃——你看，现在却放在那个架子上。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Everything sounds so sad and solemn when you talk like that."</p>

<p>“经过你这么一说，每一件事情都显得悲伤而严肃。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Life is both sad and solemn. We are let into a wonderful world, we meet one another here, greet each other--and wander together for a brief moment. Then we lose each other and disappear as suddenly and unreasonably as we arrived."</p>

<p>“生命本来就是悲伤而严肃的。我们来到这个美好的世界里，彼此相逢，彼此问候，并结伴同游一段短暂的时间。然后我们就失去了对方，并且莫名其妙就消失了，就像我们突然莫名其妙的来到世上一般。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"May I ask you something?"</p>

<p>“我可以问你一件事吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We're not playing hide-and-seek any more."</p>

<p>“我们不再玩捉迷藏的游戏了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Why did you move into the major's cabin?"</p>

<p>“你为什么会搬到少校的小木屋？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So that we would not be so far from each other, when we were only talking by letter. I knew the old cabin would be empty."</p>

<p>“为了缩短我们之间的距离呀！因为那个时候我们全凭通信联络。我知道那时小木屋刚好是空的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So you just moved in?"</p>

<p>“所以你就搬进去了！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's right. I moved in."</p>

<p>“没错。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Then maybe you can also explain how Hilde's father knew you were there."</p>

<p>“那或许你也可以告诉我席德的爸爸是如何知道你在那里的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"If I am right, he knows practically everything."</p>

<p>“如果我说的没错，每一件事情他都知道。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But I still can't understand at all how you get a mailman to deliver mail in the middle of the woods!"</p>

<p>“但我还是不懂你怎么有办法让邮差跑到森林里面去送信！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto smiled archly.</p>

<p>艾伯特淘气地笑了一下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Even things like that are a pure bagatelle for Hilde's father. Cheap hocus-pocus, simple sleight of hand. We are living under what is possibly the world's closest surveillance."</p>

<p>“即使那样的事情，对席德的父亲来说也算不了什么，只不过是个小把戏，妙手一挥就成了。我们现在可能正受到全世界最严密的监视。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie could feel herself getting angry.</p>

<p>苏菲顿时觉得一股怒气往上升。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"If I ever meet him, I'll scratch his eyes out!"</p>

<p>“要是让我碰上他，一定把他的眼珠子挖出来。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto walked over and sat down on the sofa. Sophie followed and sank into a deep armchair.</p>

<p>艾伯特走到房间的另外一边，坐在沙发上。苏菲跟着他，也坐在一张宽大的扶手椅上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Only philosophy can bring us closer to Hilde's father," Alberto said at last. "Today I shall tell you about the Renaissance."</p>

<p>“只有哲学可以使我们更接近席德的父亲。”他终于说。“今天我要跟你谈文艺复兴时期。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Shoot."</p>

<p>“快说吧！” </p></div>

<div class='layout'>

<p class="title">Renaissance</p>

<p class="title">文艺复兴 </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Not very long after St. Thomas Aquinas, cracks began to appear in the unifying culture of Christianity. Philosophy and science broke away more and more from the theology of the Church, thus enabling religious life to attain a freer relationship to reasoning. More people now emphasized that we cannot reach God through rationalism because God is in all ways unknowable. The important thing for a man was not to understand the divine mystery but to submit to God's will.</p>

<p>“在圣多玛斯的时代过后不久，原本团结一致的天主教文化开始出现分裂的现象。哲学与科学逐渐脱离教会的神学，使得宗教生活与理性思考之间的关系变得比较自由。当时有愈来愈多人强调人们不能透过理性与天主沟通，因为天主绝对是不可知的。对人来说，最重要的事不是去了解神的奥秘，而是服从神的旨意。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"As religion and science could now relate more freely to each other, the way was open both to new scientific methods and a new religious fervor. Thus the basis was created for two powerful upheavals in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, namely, the Renaissance and the Reformation."</p>

<p>“既然宗教与科学的关系已经变得较为自由，新的科学方法与新的宗教狂热于是逐渐产生。在这种环境下，十五与十六世纪发生了两大变动，就是文艺复兴运动与宗教改革运动。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Can we take them one at a time?"</p>

<p>“我们可不可以一个一个来？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"By the Renaissance we mean the rich cultural development that began in the late fourteenth century. It started in Northern Italy and spread rapidly northward during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries."</p>

<p>“所谓文艺复兴运动是指十四世纪末期起文化蓬勃发展的现象，最先开始于意大利北部，并在十五与十六世纪期间迅速向北蔓延。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Didn't you tell me that the word 'renaissance' meant rebirth?"</p>

<p>“你不是告诉我‘文艺复兴’这个字是表示‘重生’的意思吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I did indeed, and that which was to be reborn was the art and culture of antiquity. We also speak of Renaissance humanism, since now, after the long Dark Ages in which every aspect of life was seen through divine light, everything once again revolved around man. 'Go to the source' was the motto, and that meant the humanism of antiquity first and foremost.</p>

<p>“没错。它是指古代艺术与文化的再生。另外我们也说它是‘人道主义的复兴’，因为在漫长的中世纪，生命中的一切都是从神的观点来解释，但到了文艺复兴时期，一切又重新以人为中心。当时的口号是‘回归本源’，所谓本源主要是指古代的人文主义。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It almost became a popular pastime to dig up ancient sculptures and scrolls, just as it became fashionable to learn Greek. The study of Greek humanism also had a pedagogical aim. Reading humanistic subjects provided a 'classical education' and developed what may be called human qualities. 'Horses are born,' it was said, 'but human beings are not born--they are formed.' "</p>

<p>“在文艺复兴时期，发掘古代的经卷典籍几乎成为一种大众休闲活动，学习希腊文也变成时髦的玩意。当时的人认为，修习希腊的人文主义有教导与启发的功能，它除了可以使人了解古代的思想文化之外，也可以发展他们所谓的‘人的特质’。他们认为：‘马生下来就是马，但人要做为一个人，还需要靠后天慢慢的培养。’” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Do we have to be educated to be human beings?"</p>

<p>“我们一定要受教育才可以成为一个人吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, that was the thought. But before we take a closer look at the ideas of Renaissance humanism, we must say a little about the political and cultural background of the Renaissance."</p>

<p>“是的，当时的人观念确是如此。不过在我们详谈文艺复兴时期的人文理念之前，我们必须大略了解一下文艺复兴时期的政治与文化背景。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto rose from the sofa and began to wander about the room. After a while he paused and pointed to an antique instrument on one of the shelves.</p>

<p>艾伯特从沙发上起身，开始在房间里踱步。过了一会，他停下来，指着架子上放着的一件古代仪器。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>“这是什么？”他问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It looks like an old compass."</p>

<p>“看起来像是一个很旧的罗盘。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Quite right."</p>

<p>“没错。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>He then pointed to an ancient firearm hanging on the wall above the sofa.</p>

<p>然后他又指着沙发后面的墙壁上挂着的一件古代火器。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>“那又是什么？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"An old-fashioned rifle."</p>

<p>“一支老式的步枪。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Exactly--and this?"</p>

<p>“没错。这个呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto pulled a large book off one of the bookshelves.</p>

<p>艾伯特从书架上抽出一本大书。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's an old book."</p>

<p>“是一本古书。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"To be absolutely precise, it is an incunabulum."</p>

<p>“严格地说，这是一本古版书。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"An incunabulum?"</p>

<p>“古版书？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Actually, it means 'cradle.' The word is used about books printed in the cradle days of printing. That is, before 1500."</p>

<p>“是的，就是公元一五OO年前印制的古书。当时印刷业仍处于襁褓阶段。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Is it really that old?"</p>

<p>“这本书真的有那么古老吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That old, yes. And these three discoveries--the compass, firearms, and the printing press--were essential preconditions for this new period we call the Renaissance."</p>

<p>“是的。罗盘、火器与印刷术这三大发明，乃是文艺复兴时期所以形成的重要因素。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You'll have to explain that a bit more clearly."</p>

<p>“请你说详细一些。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The compass made it easier to navigate. In other words, it was the basis for the great voyages of discovery. So were firearms in a way. The new weapons gave the Europeans military superiority over American and Asiatic cultures, although firearms were also an important factor in Europe. Printing played an important part in spreading the Renaissance humanists' new ideas. And the art of printing was, not least, one of the factors that forced the Church to relinquish its former position as sole disseminator of knowledge. New inventions and instruments began to follow thick and fast. One important instrument, for example, was the telescope, which resulted in a completely new basis for astronomy." </p>

<p>“有了罗盘，航海就比较容易了，这为后来一些伟大的探险航程奠定了基础。火器也是一样，这种新式的武器使得欧洲军队的军力要比美洲和亚洲的军队强大。在欧洲内部，是否拥有火器也成为一个国家强大与否的关键因素。印刷术则在散布文艺复兴时期的人本理念方面有很重要的贡献，同时印刷术的发明也使得教会不再是唯一能够散播知识的机构。在这段时期，各项新的发明与仪器接踵而来，速度既快，数量也多。其中很重要的一项就是望远镜的发明，它使得天文学迈人了新的纪元。” </p></div>

<p>"Now you're going too fast. But you could say that a process started in the Renaissance finally brought people to the moon. Or for that matter to Hiroshima and Chernobyl. However, it all began with changes on the cultural and economic front. An important condition was the transition from a subsistence economy to a monetary economy. </p>

<p>“你的速度未免太快了吧。不过文艺复兴时期所发生的一项转变，最后倒是把人类送上了月球，也间接导致广岛事件与切尔诺贝利核电厂爆炸事件。最初只是文化与经济上的一些改变。其中很重要的一个现象是；自给自足式的经济逐渐转型为货币经济体系。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Toward the end of the Middle Ages, cities had developed, with effective trades and a lively commerce of new goods, a monetary economy and banking. A middle class arose which developed a certain freedom with regard to the basic conditions of life. Necessities became something that could be bought for money. This state of affairs rewarded people's diligence, imagination, and ingenuity. New demands were made on the individual."</p>

<p>在中世纪末期时，由于贸易制度成功、新商品交易蓬勃，再加上已经建立货币经济与银行体系，于是各城市不断发展，造成了一个新的中产阶级。他们拥有决定自己生活环境的自由，可以用钱买到各种必需品。在这个时期，只要肯吃苦耐劳、有想像力、脑筋灵活，便可以获得报偿。因此，社会对个人的要求已经改变。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's a bit like the way Greek cities developed two thousand years earlier."</p>

<p>“这和两千年前希腊各城邦发展的情况有些类似。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Not altogether untrue. I told you how Greek philosophy broke away from the mythological world picture that was linked to peasant culture. In the same way, the Renaissance middle class began to break away from the feudal lords and the power of the church. As this was happening, Greek culture was being rediscovered through a closer contact with the Arabs in Spain and the Byzantine culture in the east."</p>

<p>“你说对了几分。我曾经说过，希腊哲学脱离了属于农民文化的神话世界观。同样的，文艺复兴时期的中产阶级也开始脱离封建贵族与教会的势力。这段期间，欧洲与西班牙的阿拉伯人和东方的拜占庭文化接触日益密切，于是欧洲人又开始注意到希腊文化的存在。” </p></div>

<div class='layout'>

<p>"Above all else, the Renaissance resulted in a new view of mankind. The humanism of the Renaissance brought a new belief in man and his worth, in striking contrast to the biased medieval emphasis on the sinful nature of man. Man was now considered infinitely great and valuable. One of the central figures of the Renaissance was Marsilio Ficino, who exclaimed: 'Know thyself, O divine lineage in mortal guise!' Another central figure, Pica della Mirandola, wrote the Oration on the Dignity of Man, something that would have been unthinkable in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>“文艺复兴运动最重要的影响是改变了大家对人类的看法。文艺复兴时期的人文主义精神使得大家对人本身和人的价值重新产生了信心，这和中世纪时强调人性本恶的观点截然不同。这个时期的哲学家认为人是极其崇高可贵的。其中最主要的人物之一是费其诺(Marsilio Ficino)。他告诉人们：“认识自己，呵，你这藏在凡俗身躯内的神明子孙啊！”另外一个主要人物是米兰多拉(Pieodella Mirandola)，他写了《颂扬人的尊贵》这篇文章，这在中世纪简直是无法想象的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Throughout the whole medieval period, the point of departure had always been God. The humanists of the Renaissance took as their point of departure man himself."</p>

<p>“在中世纪期间，上帝是一切事物的出发点。文艺复兴时期的人文主义则以人为出发点。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But so did the Greek philosophers."</p>

<p>“希腊哲学家也是一样啊！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That is precisely why we speak of a 'rebirth' of antiquity's humanism. But Renaissance humanism was to an even greater extent characterized by individualism. We are not only human beings, we are unique individuals. This idea could then lead to an almost unrestrained worship of genius. The ideal became what we call the Renaissance man, a man of universal genius embracing all aspects of life, art, and science. The new view of man also manifested itself in an interest in the human anatomy. As in ancient times, people once again began to dissect the dead to discover how the body was constructed. It was imperative both for medical science and for art. Once again it became usual for works of art to depict the nude. High time, after a thousand years of prudery. Man was bold enough to be himself again. There was no longer anything to be ashamed of."</p>

<p>“这正是为什么我们会说文艺复兴时期是古代人文主义‘重生’的缘故。但文艺复兴时期的人文主义更强调个人主义。当时人的观念是：我们不仅是人，更是独一无二的个体。这种理念导致人们无限崇拜天才。理想中的人是我们所谓的‘文艺复兴人’，就是艺术、科学等十八般武艺样样精通的人。由于对人的观点改变了，于是人们开始对人体的构造产生兴趣。就像在古代一般，人们又开始解剖尸体以了解人体的结构。这对医学和艺术而言都是很有必要的。同时，这个时期也再度出现许多描绘人体的艺术作品。在历经一千年的假道学之后，这也该是时候了。人又有了胆量表现自己，不再以自己为耻。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It sounds intoxicating," said Sophie, leaning her arms on the little table that stood between her and the philosopher.</p>

<p>“太好了。”苏菲说，一边把双臂靠在她和哲学家中间的小茶几上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Undeniably. The new view of mankind led to a whole new outlook. Man did not exist purely for God's sake. Man could therefore delight in life here and now. And with this new freedom to develop, the possibilities were limitless. The aim was now to exceed all boundaries. This was also a new idea, seen from the Greek humanistic point of view; the humanists of antiquity had emphasized the importance of tranquility, moderation, and restraint."</p>

<p>“的确如此。这种对人的新观念创造了一个全新的视野。人并不只是为神而存在的，因此人也不妨及时行乐。有了这种新的自由之后，任何事情都是可能的。这个时期人们的目标是要打破所有的藩篱与禁忌。从希腊人文主义的观点来说，这倒是一个新的想法，因为古代的人文主义强调的是宁静、中庸与节制。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And the Renaissance humanists lost their restraint?"</p>

<p>“结果文艺复兴时期的人文主义者就变得很放纵了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"They were certainly not especially moderate. They behaved as if the whole world had been reawakened.They became intensely conscious of their epoch, which is what led them to introduce the term 'Middle Ages' to cover the centuries between antiquity and their own time. There was an unrivaled development in all spheres of life. Art and architecture, literature, music, philosophy, and science flourished as never before. I will mention one concrete example. We have spoken of Ancient Rome, which gloried in titles such as the 'city of cities' and the 'hub of the universe.' During the Middle Ages the city declined, and by 1417 the old metropolis had only 17,000 inhabitants."</p>

<p>“他们当然不是很节制的。他们的所作所为就好像整个世界重新复苏了一般。他们强烈地感受到时代的精神，这是为何他们将介于古代与文艺复兴时期之间的几百年称为‘中世纪’的缘故。在文艺复兴时期，各个领域都有无可比拟的进展。无论艺术、建筑、文学、音乐、哲学与科学都以空前的速度蓬勃发展。举一个具体的例子：我们曾经谈到古代的罗马曾有‘城市中的城市’与‘宇宙的中枢’等美称，但在中世纪期间，罗马渐渐衰微，到公元一四一七年时，人口只剩下一万七千人。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Not much more than Lillesand, where Hilde lives."</p>

<p>“比席德住的黎乐桑市多不了多少嘛。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The Renaissance humanists saw it as their cultural duty to restore Rome: first and foremost, to begin the construction of the great St. Peter's Church over the grave of Peter the Apostle. And St. Peter's Church can boast neither of moderation nor restraint. Many great artists of the Renaissance took part in this building project, the greatest in the world. It began in 1506 and lasted for a hundred and twenty years, and it took another fifty before the huge St. Peter's Square was completed."</p>

<p>“文艺复兴时期的人文主义者认为重建罗马是他们的文化责任，而最重要的一项工作就是在圣彼得的坟墓上建一座圣彼得大教堂。这座教堂号称世界第一，极尽富丽与堂皇之能事。许多文艺复兴时期的伟大艺术家都参与了兴建工作。这项工程从一五0六年开始，进行了一百二十年之久。后来，又花了五十年的时间兴建宏伟的圣彼得广场。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It must be a gigantic church!"</p>

<p>“这座教堂一定很大！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It is over 200 meters long and 130 meters high, and it covers an area of more than 16,000 square meters. But enough about the boldness of Renaissance man. It was also significant that the Renaissance brought with it a new view of nature. The fact that man felt at home in the world and did not consider life solely as a preparation for the hereafter, created a whole new approach to the physical world. </p>

<p>“它共有两百多米长、一百三十米宽，占地二万六千平方米以上。有关文艺复兴时期人们大胆自信的心理我们就讲到这里了。还有很重要的一点是：文艺复兴运动也使得人们对大自然有了新的看法。这时候的人们比较能够尽情享受生活，不再认为人活着只是为死后的世界做准备，因此他们对物质世界的看法也完全改观了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Nature was now regarded as a positive thing. Many held the view that God was also present in his creation. If he is indeed infinite, he must be present in everything. This idea is called pantheism. The medieval philosophers had insisted that there is an insurmountable barrier between God and the Creation. It could now be said that nature is divine--and even that it is 'God's blossoming.' Ideas of this kind were not always looked kindly on by the church. The fate of Gior-dano Bruno was a dramatic example of this. Not only did he claim that God was present in nature, he also believed that the universe was infinite in scope. He was punished very severely for his ideas."</p>

<p>在人们眼中，大自然如今有了正面的意义。许多人认为上帝也存在于他所创造的事物中。因为，如果神真的是无穷无限的，他就会存在于万事万物中。这种观念称为泛神论。中世纪的哲学家一直坚持神与他的造物之间有一道不可跨越的距离。文艺复兴时期的人则认为大自然是神圣的，甚至是‘神的花朵’。这类观念有时会遭到教会的反对。布鲁诺(Giordano Bruo)的命运就是一个很极端的例子。他不仅宣称神存在于大自然中，而且相信宇宙是无限大的。结果他受到了非常严厉的惩罚。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>“什么惩罚？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"He was burned at the stake in Rome's Flower Market in the year 1600."</p>

<p>“他在一六OO午时被绑在罗马花市的一根柱子上活活烧死。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"How horrible ... and stupid. And you call that humanism?"</p>

<p>“真是太烂了……太蠢了。这还叫人文主义吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>No, not at all. Bruno was the humanist, not his executioners. </p>

<p>“不，绝不是。布鲁诺是人文主义者，但将他处决的人则不是。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>During the Renaissance, what we call anti-humanism flourished as well. By this I mean the authoritarian power of State and Church. During the Renaissance there was a tremendous thirst for trying witches, burning heretics, magic and superstition, bloody religious wars--and not least, the brutal conquest of America. But humanism has always had a shadow side. No epoch is either purely good or purely evil. Good and evil are twin threads that run through the history of mankind. And often they intertwine. This is not least true of our next key phrase, a new scientific method, another Renaissance innovation which I will tell you about."</p>

<p>不过在文艺复兴时期，所谓的‘反人文主义’也同样盛行。我所谓的‘反人文主义’指的是各国政府与教会的威权。在文艺复兴时期，审判女巫、烧死异教徒的风气非常盛行。魔法、迷信充斥，而且不时有人发动血腥的宗教战争。美洲也是在这段时期被欧洲人用蛮横的手段征服了。这些都是人文主义阴暗的一面。不过话说回来，没有任何一个时代是完全好或完全坏的。善恶乃是人类历史中不时交织在一起的两股线。在我们下面要讲到的另外一个文艺复兴时期的新产物‘新科学方法’方面也是如此。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Was that when they built the first factories?"</p>

<p>“当时的人是否兴建了人类史上最早的一些工厂？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No, not yet. But a precondition for all the technical development that took place after the Renaissance was the new scientific method. By that I mean the completely new approach to what science was. The technical fruits of this method only became apparent later on."</p>

<p>“还没有。不过多亏文艺复兴时期发明的新科学方法，才会有后来那些科技发展。所谓新科学方法是指以崭新的角度来看待科学，这种方法到后来才结出明显的科技果实。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What was this new method?"</p>

<p>“那是什么样的新方法？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Mainly it was a process of investigating nature with our own senses. Since the fourteenth century there had been an increasing number of thinkers who warned against blind faith in old authority, be it religious doctrine or the natural philosophy of Aristotle. There were also warnings against the belief that problems can be solved purely by thinking. An exaggerated belief in the importance of reason had been valid all through the Middle Ages. Now it was said that every investigation of natural phenomena must be based on observation, experience, and experiment. We call this the empirical method."</p>

<p>“它最主要的一点是用我们的感官来调查研究大自然，自从十四世纪以来，愈来愈多思想家警告人们不要盲目相信权威，无论是宗教教条或亚理斯多德的自然哲学。但也有人劝告大众不要相信纯粹凭思考就可以解决问题。在整个中世纪期间，人们过度迷信理性思考的重要性。到了文艺复兴时期，则认为研究大自然现象必须以观察、经验与实验为基础。我们称之为‘实证法’。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Which means?"</p>

<p>“意思是？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It only means that one bases one's knowledge of things on one's own experience--and not on dusty parchments or figments of the imagination. Empirical science was known in antiquity, but systematic experiments were something quite new."</p>

<p>“就是以亲身经验，而不是以古人的著作或凭空想象之物，来做为知识的基础。古代也有实证科学，但从来不曾以有系统的方式做过实验。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I guess they didn't have any of the technical apparatus we have today."</p>

<p>“我猜他们大概没有现代这些仪器设备。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Of course they had neither calculators nor electronic scales. But they had mathematics and they had scales. And it was now above all imperative to express scientific observations in precise mathematical terms. 'Measure what can be measured, and make measurable what can-not be measured,' said the Italian Galileo Galilei, who was one of the most important scientists of the seventeenth century. He also said that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics."</p>

<p>“当然，他们没有计算机或电子尺这类工具，但是他们可以凭借数学计算和普通的尺。对他们而言，最重要的一件事就是把科学观察所得的结果用准确的数学辞汇表达出来。十七世纪的大科学家伽利略(Galileo Galilei)说：‘我们要测量那些可以测量的东西，至于那些无法测量的，也要想办法加以测量。’他并表示：‘大自然这本书是用数学的语言写的。’” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And all these experiments and measurements made new inventions possible."</p>

<p>“有了这些实验与测量结果之后，就自然会有新发明了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The first phase was a new scientific method. This made the technical revolution itself possible, and the technical breakthrough opened the way for every invention since. You could say that man had begun to break away from his natural condition. Nature was no longer something man was simply a part of. 'Knowledge is power,' said the English philosopher Francis Bacon, thereby underlining the practical value of knowledge-- and this was indeed new. Man was seriously starting to intervene in nature and beginning to control it."</p>

<p>“新科学方法的出现促成了技术革命，这是第一个阶段。而技术革命又为后来的每一项发明打下了基础。可以说人类这时已经开始脱离自然环境了，人类不再仅仅是大自然的一部分。英国哲学家培根(Francis Bacon)表示：‘知识即力量。’这句话强调了知识的实用价值，在当时也是一个很新的观念。人们开始认真干预大自然并加以控制。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But not only in a good way?"</p>

<p>“但这并不一定是好的，不是吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No, this is what I was referring to before when I spoke of the good and the evil threads that are constantly intertwined in everything we do. The technical revolution that began in the Renaissance led to the spinning jenny and to unemployment, to medicines and new diseases, to the improved efficiency of agriculture and the impoverishment of the environment, to practical appliances such as the washing machine and the refrigerator and pollution and industrial waste. The serious threat to the environment we are facing today has made many people see the technical revolution itself as a perilous maladjustment to natural conditions. It has been pointed out that we have started something we can no longer control. More optimistic spirits think we are still living in the cradle of technology, and that although the scientific age has certainly had its teething troubles, we will gradually learn to control nature without at the same time threatening its very existence and thus our own."</p>

<p>“对。我曾经提到过，我们所做的每一件事情都有正反两面的作用。文艺复兴时期展开的技术革命虽然带来了纺织机，但也造成了失业；虽然带来了新的药物，但也带来了新的疾病；虽然提高了农业效率，但也榨取了许多自然资源；虽然带来了洗衣机、电冰箱等实用的器具，但也导致了污染与工业废弃物处理的问题。今天我们面临严重的环境污染问题已经使得许多人认为，技术革命乃是人类尝试调整自然环境的一种危险做法，而且已经失败，有人指出，这场革命最终将会走向失控的局面。比较乐观的人士则认为我们目前仍处于科技的襁褓阶段，同时，尽管在科学发展的过程中不免会有阵痛，但人类终将逐渐学习到如何控制大自然，而不致对环境构成威胁。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Which do you think?"</p>

<p>“你觉得谁说的比较对？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I think perhaps there may be some truth in both views. In some areas we must stop interfering with nature, but in others we can succeed. One thing is certain: There is no way back to the Middle Ages. Ever since the Renaissance, mankind has been more than just part of creation. Man has begun to intervene in nature and form it after his own image. In truth, 'what a piece of work is man!' "</p>

<p>“我觉得双方的说法或许都有点道理。在某些领域内我们必须停止干预自然，但在其他领域内我们则不妨更进一步。但有一件事情是可以确定的：我们绝不可能再走中世纪的老路。自从文艺复兴时期以来，人类就不再只是创造物的一部分，而开始干预自然，并按照自己的心意来改造大自然。说真的，‘人是多么了不起呀！’” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We have already been to the moon. What medieval person would have believed such a thing possible?"</p>

<p>“人类已经登陆月球了。在中世纪，谁会相信人能跑到月亮上去呀！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p></p>

<p>新世界观</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No, that's for sure. Which brings us to the new world view. All through the Middle Ages people had stood beneath the sky and gazed up at the sun, the moon, the stars, and the planets. But nobody had doubted that the earth was the center of the universe. No observations had sown any doubt that the earth remained still while the 'heavenly bodies' traveled in their orbits around it. We call this the geocentric world picture, or in other words, the belief that everything revolves around the earth. The Christian belief that God ruled from on high, up above all the heavenly bodies, also contributed to maintaining this world picture."</p>

<p>“他们当然无法想象。说到这里，我们要谈谈所谓的‘新世界观’。中世纪的人虽然也会坐在天空下，看着太阳、月亮与星球。但他们从不曾怀疑‘地球是宇宙中心’的说法。他们认为地球是静止不动的，而各个‘天体’则在轨道上环绕着地球运行。这种观念被称为‘以地球为中心的世界观’，也就是‘万物皆以地球为中心’的意思。基督教相信上帝高居各天体之上，主宰宇宙，这也是当时人抱持这种观念的原因之一。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I wish it were that simple!"</p>

<p>“世界真有这么简单就好了！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But in 1543 a little book was published entitled On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres. It was written by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, who died on the day the book was published. Copernicus claimed that it was not the sun that moved round the earth, it was vice versa. He thought this was completely possible from the observations of the heavenly bodies that existed. The reason people had always believed that the sun went round the earth was that the earth turns on its own axis, he said. He pointed out that all observations of heavenly bodies were far easier to understand if one assumed that both the earth and the other planets circle around the sun. We call this the heliocentric world picture, which means that everything centers around the sun."</p>

<p>“然而，在一五四三年，有一本名叫《天体运行论》(On the Revolutions　OF the Celestial Spheres)的小书出版了。作者是波兰天文学家哥白尼(Nicolaus Copernicus)。他在这本书出版当天就去世了。哥白尼在书中宣称，太阳并未绕地球运行，而是地球绕太阳运行。他根据观察各星球的心得，认为这种可能性很高。他说，人们之所以相信太阳绕着地球转，是因为地球绕着自己的轴心转的缘故。他指出，如果我们假设地球和其他星球都绕着太阳转，则我们所看到的天体运转现象将会变得容易理解得多。我们称这种观念为‘以太阳为中心的世界观’，也就是相信万物以太阳为中心的意思。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And that world picture was the right one?"</p>

<p>“这个世界观应该是正确的啰？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Not entirely. His main point--that the earth moves round the sun--is of course correct. But he claimed that the sun was the center of the universe. Today we know that the sun is only one of an infinite number of stars, and that all the stars around us make up only one of many billions of galaxies. Copernicus also believed that the earth and the other planets moved in circular orbits around the sun."</p>

<p>“也不全然。哥白尼的主要论点—一地球围绕着太阳转——当然是正确的。不过他宣称太阳是宇宙中心的说法可就错了。我们现在已经知道太阳系只是宇宙中无数个星系之一。宇宙中共有数十亿个银河系，围绕太阳的星系只是其中之一罢了。哥白尼并且相信地球和其他星球都在圆形的轨道上运转。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Don't they?"</p>

<p>“难道不是吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No. He had nothing on which to base his belief in the circular orbits other than the ancient idea that heavenly bodies were round and moved in circles simply because they were 'heavenly.' Since the time of Plato the sphere and the circle had been considered the most per-fect geometrical figures. But in the early 1600s, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler presented the results of comprehensive observations which showed that the planets move in elliptical--or oval--orbits with the sun at one focus. He also pointed out that the speed of a planet is greatest when it is closest to the sun, and that the farther a planet's orbit is from the sun the slower it moves. Not until Kepler's time was it actually stated that the earth was a planet just like other planets. Kepler also emphasized that the same physical laws apply everywhere throughout the universe."</p>

<p>“不。他之所以相信轨道是圆形的，只是根据‘天体是圆形的，且绕着圈圈转’这个古老的观念。自从柏拉图的时代以来，球体与圆形就被认为是最完美的几何图形。但在十七世纪初期，德国天文学家克卜勒(Johannes Kepler)发表了他广泛观察的结果，显示各星球实际上是以太阳为中心，绕着椭圆形的轨道运转。他并且指出，一个星球在轨道上愈接近太阳的地方，运转的速度愈快，离太阳愈远则愈慢。在此之前从来没有人明白提出‘地球只是众多行星之一’的说法。克卜勒同时强调宇宙每个地方都适用同样的物理法则。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"How could he know that?"</p>

<p>“他怎么知道呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p></p>

<p>伽利略</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Because he had investigated the movements of the planets with his own senses instead of blindly trusting ancient superstitions. Galileo Galilei, who was roughly contemporary with Kepler, also used a telescope to observe the heavenly bodies. He studied the moon's craters and said that the moon had mountains and valleys similar to those on earth. Moreover, he discovered that the planet Jupiter had four moons. So the earth was not alone in having a moon. But the greatest significance of Galileo was that he first formulated the so-called Law of Inertia."</p>

<p>“因为他用自己的感官来观察、研究星球运转的现象，而不盲目地接受古代的迷信。大约与克卜勒同一时代的还有一位意大利科学家伽利略。他也用天文望远镜来观察天体的运转。他在研究月球的表面后，宣称月球像地球一样有高山、有深谷。更重要的是，他发现木星有四个卫星。因此地球并非唯一拥有卫星的星球。然而，伽利略最伟大的成就还是他首度提出所谓的(‘惯性定律’。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "And that is?"</p>

<p>“那是什么意思？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Galileo formulated it thus: A body remains in the state which it is in, at rest or in motion, as long as no external force compels it to change its state."</p>

<p>“伽利略的说法是：‘如果没有外力强迫一个物体改变它所处的状态，则这个物体将会一直维持它原来静止或移动的状态。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"If you say so."</p>

<p>“这谁都知道呀！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But this was a significant observation. Since antiquity, one of the central arguments against the earth moving round its own axis was that the earth would then move so quickly that a stone hurled straight into the air would fall yards away from the spot it was hurled from."</p>

<p>“但这个观察很有意义。自从古代以来，反对‘地球绕着自己的轴心转’这个说法的人士所持的主要理由之一就是：地球果真绕着自己的轴心转的话，则它的速度会很快，以至于当你垂直丢一块石头到空中时，它会掉落在好几码之外。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So why doesn't it?"</p>

<p>“那这种现象为什么不会发生呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"If you're sitting in a train and you drop an apple, it doesn't fall backward because the train is moving. It falls straight down. That is because of the law of inertia. The apple retains exactly the same speed it had before you dropped it."</p>

<p>“如果你坐在火车里，把一个苹果丢在地上。苹果并不会因为火车正在移动而向后掉落，而是垂直落地。这是由于(‘惯性定律’作用所致。苹果维持在你将它丢下以前同样的速度。” </p></div>

<p>“……因为在你放手后球仍然维持原来的速度。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But it will stop eventually, if the room is long enough."</p>

<p>“不过它最后还是会停下来，如果房间够大的话。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's because other forces slow it down. First, the floor, especially if it is a rough wooden floor. Then the force of gravity will sooner or later bring it to a halt. But wait, I'll show you something."</p>

<p>“那是因为有其他外力迫使它停下来。第一种力来自于地板，尤其是那种粗糙不平的木头地板。然后则是重力。在重力的作用下，球迟早会停下来，不过，请等一下，我先让你看一样东西。” </p></div>

<p>Alberto Knox got up and went over to the old desk. He took something out of one of the drawers. When he returned to his place he put it on the coffee table. It was just a wooden board, a few millimeters thick at one end and thin at the other. Beside the board, which almost covered the whole table, he laid a green marble.</p>

<p>艾伯特站起身来，走到那张古老的书桌前。他从抽屉里拿出一样东西，走回原来的地方，并把那样东西放在茶几上。那是一块木头板子，一端有三、四公分厚，另一端则极薄，整张板子几乎就把茶几占满了。艾伯特在板子旁放了一个绿色的弹珠。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"This is called an inclined plane," he said. "What do you think will happen if I let go the marble up here, where the plane is thickest?"</p>

<p>“这叫做斜面，”他说。“如果我在比较厚的这一端把弹珠放掉，你想会发生什么事？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie sighed resignedly.</p>

<p>苏菲无可奈何地叹了口气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I bet you ten crowns it rolls down onto the table and ends on the floor."</p>

<p>“我跟你赌十块钱，它会一直滚到茶几上，最后掉在地板上。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Let's see."</p>

<p>“我们试试看。”．</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto let go of the marble and it behaved exactly as Sophie had said. It rolled onto the table, over the tabletop, hit the floor with a little thud and finally bumped into the wall.</p>

<p>艾伯特放掉弹珠。它果真像所说的那样滚到茶几上，然后啪一声掉在地板上，最后碰到了通往走廊的门槛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Impressive," said Sophie.</p>

<p>“真了不起呀！”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, wasn't it! This was the kind of experiment Galileo did, you see."</p>

<p>“可不是嘛！这就是伽利略所做的实验。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Was he really that stupid?"</p>

<p>“他真的有那么笨吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Patience! He wanted to investigate things with all his senses, so we have only just begun. Tell me first why the marble rolled down the inclined plane."</p>

<p>“别急，他是想透过各种感官来观察事物的原理。我们现在只不过刚开始而已。请你先告诉我弹珠为何会沿着斜面滚下去？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It began to roll because it was heavy."</p>

<p>“因为它有重量。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"All right. And what is weight actually, child?"</p>

<p>“好，那么请你告诉我重量是什么。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's a silly question."</p>

<p>“这个问题问得太逊了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's not a silly question if you can't answer it. Why did the marble roll onto the floor?"</p>

<p>“如果你不能回答，它就不算逊。到底弹珠为什么会滚落到地板上？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Because of gravity."</p>

<p>“因为重力的缘故。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Exactly--or gravitation, as we also say. Weight has something to do with gravity. That was the force that set the marble in motion."</p>

<p>“答对了，你也可以说是地心引力。重量与重力有关，而重力就是使得弹珠移动的那个力量。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto had already picked the marble up from the floor. He stood bowed over the inclined plane with the marble again.</p>

<p>此时艾伯特已经把弹珠从地板上捡起来了。他再度俯身站在那块斜面上方，手里仍拿着弹珠。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Now I shall try to roll the marble across the plane," he said. "Watch carefully how it moves."</p>

<p>“现在我要试着让弹珠滚过斜面。”他说。“你注意看它怎样移动。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie watched as the marble gradually curved away and was drawn down the incline.</p>

<p>他把腰弯得更低，瞄准目标，试着让弹珠滚过斜面。苏菲看到弹珠逐渐沿着坡面斜斜的滚了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What happened?" asked Alberto.</p>

<p>“发生了什么事？”艾伯特问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It rolled sloping because the board is sloping."</p>

<p>“它斜斜地滚，因为板子有坡度。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Now I'm going to brush the marble with ink ... then perhaps we can study exactly what you mean by sloping."</p>

<p>“现在我要在弹珠上涂墨汁……然后我们就可以看看到底你所谓的‘斜斜地滚’是什么意思。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>He dug out an ink brush and painted the whole marble black. Then he rolled it again. Now Sophie could see exactly where on the plane the marble had rolled because it had left a black line on the board.</p>

<p>他找出一只墨水刷，把整个弹珠涂黑，然后再度使它滚动。这次苏菲很明显看到弹珠在斜面上滚动的路径，因为它滚过之处留下了一条黑线。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"How would you describe the marble's path?"</p>

<p>“现在你可不可以描述一下弹珠移动的路线？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's curved ... it looks like part of a circle."</p>

<p>“是弧形的……看起来好像是一个圆圈的一部分。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>“一点也没错。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto looked up at her and raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>艾伯特抬头看着苏菲，眉毛抬得高高的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "However, it is not quite a circle. This figure is called a parabola."</p>

<p>“不过那并不完全是圆形。这种图案叫做抛物线。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's fine with me."</p>

<p>“哦？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Ah, but why did the marble travel in precisely that way?"</p>

<p>“嗯。可是弹珠为什么会这样滚动呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie thought deeply. Then she said, "Because the board was sloping, the marble was drawn toward the floor by the force of gravity."</p>

<p>苏菲用心地想了一下，然后说；“因为板子有坡度，所以弹珠被重力拉往地板的方向。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, yes! This is nothing less than a sensation! Here I go, dragging a girl who's not yet fifteen up to my attic, and she realizes exactly the same thing Galileo did after one single experiment!"</p>

<p>“对了！这岂不是太让人兴奋了吗？我随便拉了一个小女孩到我的阁楼来，做一个实验，她就可以领悟到伽利略所发现的原理！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>He clapped his hands. For a moment Sophie was afraid he had gone mad. He continued: "You saw what happened when two forces worked simultaneously on the same object. Galileo discovered that the same thing applied, for instance, to a cannonball. It is propelled into the air, it continues its path over the earth, but will eventually be drawn toward the earth. So it will have described a trajectory corresponding to the marble's path across the inclined plane. And this was actually a new discovery at the time of Galileo. Aristotle thought that a projectile hurled obliquely into the air would first describe a gentle curve and then fall vertically to the earth. This was not so, but nobody could know Aristotle was wrong before it had been demonstrated."</p>

<p>他拍拍手。有一阵子，苏菲很担心他已经疯了。他继续说：“你刚才看到的是两种力量同时作用在一个物体上时所产生的效果。伽利略发现这个原理同样也适用在炮弹等的物体上。炮弹被推入空中后在一段时间内会继续飞行，但迟早会被牵引到地面上，所以它会形成像弹珠滚过斜面一样的轨线，这是伽利略那个时代的新发现。亚理斯多德认为一个斜斜向空中抛出的抛射体会先呈微微的弧形，然后垂直地向地面降落。但实际情况并非如此。不过没有人知道亚理斯多德的错误，除非用实验来证明。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Does all this really matter?"</p>

<p>“这个定律有什么重要性吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Does it matter? You bet it matters! This has cosmic significance, my child. Of all the scientific discoveries in the history of mankind, this is positively the most important."</p>

<p>“当然！孩子，这件事意义非凡，而且肯定是人类史上最重要的一项科学发现。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I'm sure you are going to tell me why."</p>

<p>“为什么呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p></p>

<p>牛顿</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Then along came the English physicist Isaac Newton, who lived from 1642 to 1727. He was the one who provided the final description of the solar system and the planetary orbits. Not only could he describe how the planets moved round the sun, he could also explain why they did so. He was able to do so partly by referring to what we call Galileo's dynamics."</p>

<p>“后来，在一六四二到一七二七年间，有一个名叫牛顿(Isaac Newton)的英国物理学家，他是将太阳系与星球轨道描述得最完整的一个科学家。他不但能说出各星球如何绕太阳运转，而且可以解释它们为何会如此运转。其中一部分原因就是因为他参考了我们所称的‘伽利略动力学’。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Are the planets marbles on an inclined plane then?"</p>

<p>“那些星球是不是就像滚过斜面的弹珠一样？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Something like that, yes. But wait a bit, Sophie."</p>

<p>“是的，有点像。不过不要急，苏菲。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Do I have a choice?"</p>

<p>“急也没有用，是不是？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Kepler had already pointed out that there had to be a force that caused the heavenly bodies to attract each other. There had to be, for example, a solar force which held the planets fast in their orbits. Such a force would moreover explain why the planets moved more slowly in their orbit the further away from the sun they traveled. Kepler also believed that the ebb and flow of the tides-- the rise and fall in sea level--must be the result of a lunar force."</p>

<p>“克卜勒曾经指出，各星球之间一定有某种力量使它们相互吸引。举例来说，太阳一定有某种力量使得太阳系内的各星球都固定在轨道上绕着它运转，这也是为何那些星球在离太阳愈远的地方移动得愈慢的缘故。克卜勒并且相信潮汐的涨落一定是受到月亮引力的影响。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And that's true."</p>

<p>“的确是这样，不是吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, it's true. But it was a theory Galileo rejected. He mocked Kepler, who he said had given his approval to the idea that the moon rules the water. That was because Galileo rejected the idea that the forces of gravitation could work over great distances, and also between the heavenly bodies."</p>

<p>“没错，是这样。不过伽利略反对这种说法。他嘲笑克卜勒，说他居然赞同‘月亮掌管海洋河流’的说法。这是因为伽利略不相信重力能够在很远的距离外或各星球之间发挥作用。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"He was wrong there."</p>

<p>“这回他可错了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes. On that particular point he was wrong. And that was funny, really, because he was very preoccupied with the earth's gravity and falling bodies. He had even indicated how increased force can control the movement of a body."</p>

<p>“嗯。在这一点上他是错了。这事说来也满奇怪的，因为伽利略一直专心研究地球引力与落体的原理。他甚至发现在引力增强时物体的移动会如何受到影响。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But you were talking about Newton."</p>

<p>“你刚才不是已经开始谈到牛顿了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, along came Newton. He formulated what we call the Law of Universal Gravitation. This law states that every object attracts every other object with a force that increases in proportion to the size of the objects and decreases in proportion to the distance between the objects."</p>

<p>“是的。然后牛顿出现了。他提出我们所谓的‘万有引力定律’，就是说宇宙间两个物体相互吸引的力量随物体的大小而递增，并随两物体之间的距离而递减。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I think I understand. For example, there is greater attraction between two elephants than there is between two mice. And there is greater attraction between two elephants in the same zoo than there is between an Indian elephant in India and an African elephant in Africa."</p>

<p>“我懂了。例如，两只大象之间的引力要比两只老鼠之间的引力要大。而同样一座动物园内的两只大象之间的引力，又比在印度的一只印度象与在非洲的一只非洲象两者之间的引力要大。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Then you have understood it. And now comes the central point. Newton proved that this attraction--or gravitation--is universal, which means it is operative everywhere, also in space between heavenly bodies. He is said to have gotten this idea while he was sitting under an apple tree. When he saw an apple fall from the tree he had to ask himself if the moon was drawn to earth with the same force, and if this was the reason why the moon continued to orbit the earth to all eternity."</p>

<p>“没错，你的确懂了。现在我们要谈到最重要的一点。牛顿证明这种引力是存在于宇宙各处的。也就是说，它在宇宙每个地方都发生作用，包括太空中的各个星球之间。据说他是坐在一棵苹果树下悟出这个道理的。当时他看到一个苹果从树上掉下来，他便问自己：月球是否同样也受到地球力量的牵引，才会恒久绕着地球旋转？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Smart. But not so smart really."</p>

<p>“聪明。不过也不算真的很聪明。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Why not, Sophie?"</p>

<p>“为什么呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Well, if the moon was drawn to the earth with the same force that causes the apple to fall, one day the moon would come crashing to earth instead of going round and round it for ever."</p>

<p>“这个嘛……如果月球是受到促使苹果落地的同样一种引力的影响，那么总有一天月球会撞到地球，而不会一直绕着地球转了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Which brings us to Newton's law on planetary orbits. In the case of how the earth attracts the moon, you are fifty percent right but fifty percent wrong. Why doesn't the moon fall to earth? Because it really is true that the earth's gravitational force attracting the moon is tremendous. Just think of the force required to lift sea level a meter or two at high tide."</p>

<p>“这个我们就要谈到牛顿的行星轨道定律了。在这个问题上，你只对了一半。月球为什么不会撞到地球呢？因为地球的重力的确以强大的力量牵引着月球。你想想看涨潮的情景，要将海平面提高一两公尺需要多大的力量呀。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I don't think I understand."</p>

<p>“这个我不太懂。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Remember Galileo's inclined plane. What happened when I rolled the marble across it?"</p>

<p>“你还记得伽利略的斜面吗？当我让弹珠滚过斜面时会有什么现象？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Are there two different forces working on the moon?"</p>

<p>“是不是同时有两种力量在影响月球？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Exactly. Once upon a time when the solar system began, the moon was hurled outward--outward from the earth, that is--with tremendous force. This force will remain in effect forever because it moves in a vacuum without resistance..."</p>

<p>“一点没错。很久以前，当太阳系形成时，月球被一股很大的力量抛离地球。由于它在真空中移动，没有阻力，因此这股力量会永远不停地产生作用……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But it is also attracted to the earth because of earth's gravitational force, isn't it?"</p>

<p>“但它同时也受到地球引力的影响，被拉向地球，对吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Exactly. Both forces are constant, and both work simultaneously. Therefore the moon will continue to orbit the earth."</p>

<p>“对。这两股力量都是持续不停的，而且同时发生作用，所以月球才会一直绕着地球旋转。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Is it really as simple as that?"</p>

<p>“它的原理真的就这么简单吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"As simple as that, and this very same simplicity was Newton's whole point. He demonstrated that a few natural laws apply to the whole universe. In calculating the planetary orbits he had merely applied two natural laws which Galileo had already proposed. One was the law of inertia, which Newton expressed thus: 'A body remains in its state of rest or rectilinear motion until it is compelled to change that state by a force impressed on it.' The other law had been demonstrated by Galileo on an inclined plane: When two forces work on a body simultaneously, the body will move on an elliptical path."</p>

<p>“就是这么简单。而这种‘简单性’正是牛顿学说的重点。他说明少数几种自然法则可以适用于整个宇宙。在计算行星轨道时，他只应用了伽利略所提出的两个自然法则。一个是惯性定律。牛顿说明所谓惯性定律就是‘一个物体除非受到外力的作用使它改变状态，否则它会一直处在静止或呈直线进行的状态’。另外一项定律是伽利略利用斜面证明的定律，就是：当两股力量同时作用于一个物体上时，这个物体会循椭圆形的路径移动。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And that's how Newton could explain why all the planets go round the sun."</p>

<p>“而牛顿就以此来解释为何所有行星都围绕太阳旋转？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes. All the planets travel in elliptical orbits round the sun as the result of two unequal movements: first, the rectilinear movement they had when the solar system was formed, and second, the movement toward the sun due to gravitation."</p>

<p>“没错。由于受到两种强弱不同的力量的影响，所有的行星都在椭圆形的轨道上绕太阳旋转。其中一种是在太阳系形成时，他们呈直线进行的力量，另外一种则是他们受到太阳重力牵引的力量。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Very clever."</p>

<p>“聪明。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Very. Newton demonstrated that the same laws of moving bodies apply everywhere in the entire universe. He thus did away with the medieval belief that there is one set of laws for heaven and another here on earth. The heliocentric world view had found its final confirmation and its final explanation."</p>

<p>“很聪明。牛顿证明了若干关于物体移动的定律可以适用于宇宙每一个地方，他因此推翻了中世纪人们认为天上与人间分别适用两套不同法则的看法。这时候，以太阳为宇宙中心的世界观终于得到了彻底的证实以及完整的解释。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto got up and put the inclined plane away again. He picked up the marble and placed it on the table between them.</p>

<p>艾伯特站起身来，把斜面放回原来的抽屉里。然后他弯腰从地上捡起那颗弹珠，把它放在他和苏菲间的茶几上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie thought it was amazing how much they had gotten out of a bit of slanting wood and a marble. As she looked at the green marble, which was still smudged with ink, she couldn't help thinking of the earth's globe. She said, "And people just had to accept that they were living on a random planet somewhere in space?"</p>

<p>苏菲心想，这一切居然都是科学家们从一小块斜面的木板和一个弹珠推论出来的，这是多么神奇呀！当她看着那颗仍然沾有墨水的绿色弹珠时，不禁想起地球来。她说：“于是当时的人们就不得不接受人类其实是生活在太空中某处一个偶然形成的星球上啰？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes--the new world view was in many ways a great burden. The situation was comparable to what happened later on when Darwin proved that mankind had developed from animals. In both cases mankind lost some of its special status in creation. And in both cases the Church put up a massive resistance."</p>

<p>“是的。这个新的世界观在许多方面都对人造成了很大的冲击，这个情况和后来达尔文证明人类是从禽兽进化而来时所造成的影响相当。这两个新发现都使人类失去他们在造物中的一部分特殊地位，于是也都遭遇到教会的强大阻力。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I can well understand that. Because where was God in all this new stuff? It was simpler when the earth was the center and God and the planets were upstairs."</p>

<p>“这是可以理解的。因为，在这些新观念中，上帝被放在哪里呢？从前人相信地球是宇宙中心，而上帝与各星球就在地球之上的想法倒是比较单纯些。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But that was not the greatest challenge. When Newton had proved that the same natural laws applied everywhere in the universe, one might think that he thereby undermined people's faith in God's omnipotence. But Newton's own faith was never shaken. He regarded the natural laws as proof of the existence of the great and almighty God. It's possible that man's picture of himself fared worse."</p>

<p>“但这还不是当时人面临的最大挑战。当牛顿证明宇宙各处适用同样的法则时，有人可能会认为他破坏了人们心目中的上帝无所不能的形象，但是牛顿本人的信仰却从未动摇。他认为自然法则的存在正足以证明宇宙间确有一位伟大、万能的上帝。事实上，受到更大冲击的乃是人对自我的观念。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>“怎么说呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Since the Renaissance, people have had to get used to living their life on a random planet in the vast galaxy. I am not sure we have wholly accepted it even now. But there were those even in the Renaissance who said that every single one of us now had a more central position than before."</p>

<p>“自从文艺复兴时期以来，人们就不得不逐渐接受他们所居住的地球乃是浩瀚银河中一个偶然形成的星球的说法。即使到现在，我看还是不见得大家都能够完全接受这种想法。不过，即使在文艺复兴时期，也有一些人认为，随着新世界观的产生，我们每一个人所处的地位也变得比以前更加重要。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>“我还是不太明白。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Formerly, the earth was the center of the world. But since astronomers now said that there was no absolute center to the universe, it came to be thought that there were just as many centers as there were people. Each person could be the center of a universe."</p>

<p>“在此之前，世界的中心是地球。但天文学家却告诉人们，宇宙根本没有绝对的中心，因此，每一个人都是中心。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Ah, I think I see."</p>

<p>“喔，是这个意思！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The Renaissance resulted in a new religiosity. As philosophy and science gradually broke away from theology, a new Christian piety developed. Then the Renaissance arrived with its new view of man. This had its effect on religious life. The individual's personal relationship to God was now more important than his relationship to the church as an organization."</p>

<p>“文艺复兴运动造成了新的宗教情感(狂热)。随着哲学与科学逐渐脱离神学的范畴，基督徒变得更加虔诚。到了文艺复兴时期，由于人类对自己有了新的看法，使得宗教生活也受到了影响。个人与上帝之间的关系变得比个人与教会组织之间的关系更加重要。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Like saying one's prayers at night, for instance?"</p>

<p>“比如说在晚上自行祷告之类的吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p></p>

<p>宗教的改革</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, that too. In the medieval Catholic Church, the church's liturgy in Latin and the church's ritual prayers had been the backbone of the religious service. Only priests and monks read the Bible because it only existed in Latin. But during the Renaissance, the Bible was translated from Hebrew and Greek into national languages. It was central to what we call the Reformation."</p>

<p>“这也包括在内。在中世纪的天主教教会中，以拉丁文念的祈祷文和教会例行祷告一直是宗教仪式的骨干。只有教士和僧侣能看得懂圣经，因为当时的圣经都是拉丁文写的。但是到了文艺复兴时期，圣经被人从希伯来文与希腊文翻译成各国语言。这是导致所谓‘宗教革命’的主要因素。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Martin Luther..."</p>

<p>“马丁路德……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, Martin Luther was important, but he was not the only reformer. There were also ecclesiastical reformers who chose to remain within the Roman Catholic church. One of them was Erasmus of Rotterdam."</p>

<p>“是的，马丁路德是一个很重要的人物，但他并不是当时唯一的宗教改革家。另有一些改革人士选择留在罗马天主教会中。其中之一是荷兰的伊拉斯莫斯(Erasmus of Rotterdam)。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Luther broke with the Catholic Church because he wouldn't buy indulgences, didn't he?"</p>

<p>“马丁路德之所以和天主教会决裂是因为他不肯购买赎罪券，是吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Yes, that was one of the reasons. But there was a more important reason. According to Luther, people did not need the intercession of the church or its priests in order to receive God's forgiveness. Neither was God's forgiveness dependent on the buying of 'indulgences' from the church. Trading in these so-called letters of indulgence was forbidden by the Catholic Church from the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>“是的，但这只是其中原因之一。另外还有一个更重要的原因是：马丁路德认为人们并不需要教会或教士居中代祷才能获得上帝的赦免。同时，要取得上帝的赦免也不是靠购买教会所售的‘赎罪券’。从十六世纪中期起，天主教教会就禁止买这些所谓的‘赎罪券’。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "God was probably glad of that." </p>

<p>“天主应该很乐于见到这个情况。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>In general, Luther distanced himself from many of the religious customs and dogmas that had become rooted in ecclesiastical history during the Middle Ages. He wanted to return to early Christianity as it was in the New Testament. </p>

<p>“总而言之，马丁路德摒斥了教会中许多从中世纪起就形成的宗教习惯与教条。他希望回到新约中所描述的早期基督教的面貌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The Scripture alone,' he said. With this slogan Luther wished to return to the 'source' of Christianity, just as the Renaissance humanists had wanted to turn to the ancient sources of art and culture. Luther translated the Bible into German, thereby founding the German written language. He believed every man should be able to read the Bible and thus in a sense become his own priest."</p>

<p>他说：‘我们只信靠经文。’他希望以这个口号将基督教带回它的‘源头’，就像文艺复兴时期的人文主义者希望回到艺术与文化的古老源头一般。马丁路德将圣经译成德文，因此创造了德文的文字。他认为应该让每一个人都读得懂圣经，并从某一个意义上来说，成为自己的教士。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>His own priest? Wasn't that taking it a bit far?</p>

<p>“自己的教士？这不是有点太过分了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "What he meant was that priests had no preferential position in relation to God. The Lutheran congregations employed priests for practical reasons, such as conducting services and attending to the daily clerical tasks, but Luther did not believe that anyone received God's for-giveness and redemption from sin through church rituals. Man received 'free' redemption through faith alone, he said. This was a belief he arrived at by reading the Bible."</p>

<p>“他的意思是：教士与上帝的关系并不比一般人亲近。路德派教会之所以雇用教士，乃是因为他们需要有人做一些实际的工作，如主持礼拜或料理日常事务等。但马丁路德并不相信任何人能够透过教会举行的仪式，获得上帝的赦免与宽宥。他说，人只能透过信仰得救，这是‘无法用金钱交换的’。这些都是他在研读圣经以后的心得。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>So Luther was also a typical Renaissance man?</p>

<p>“这么说马丁路德也是典型的文艺复兴人士啰？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Yes and no. A characteristic Renaissance feature was his emphasis on the individual and the individual's personal relationship to God. So he taught himself Greek at the age of thirty-five and began the laborious job of translating the Bible from the ancient Greek version into German. Allowing the language of the people to take precedence over Latin was also a characteristic Renaissance feature. But Luther was not a humanist like Ficino or Leonardo da Vinci. He was also opposed by humanists such as Erasmus of Rotterdam because they thought his view of man was far too negative; Luther had proclaimed that mankind was totally depraved after the Fall from Grace. Only through the grace of God could mankind be 'justified,' he believed. For the wages of sin is death."</p>

<p>“也不尽然。马丁路德重视个人，强调个人与上帝之间的关系。在这一点上他算是典型的文艺复兴人士。也因此他从三十五岁开始自修希腊文，并进行将圣经翻译成德文的繁重工作。他使得一般大众使用的语言取代了拉丁文的地位，这也是他与典型文艺复兴人士相像的另外一个特征。然而，马丁路德并不像费其诺或达文西一样是人文主义者。同时，他也受到伊拉斯莫斯等人文主义者的批评，因为他们认为他对人的观点太过消极了。马丁路德曾经宣称，自从亚当与夏娃被逐出伊甸园后，人类就彻底腐化了，他相信唯有透过上帝的恩典，人类才能免于罪孽。因为罪恶的代价就是死亡。” </p></div>

<p>"That sounds very gloomy."</p>

<p>“听起来满灰暗的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto Knox rose. He picked up the little green and black marble and put it in his top pocket.</p>

<p>艾伯特起身，捡起绿黑相间的小弹珠，放在上衣的口袋内。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's after four!" Sophie exclaimed in horror.</p>

<p>“天哪！已经过四点了！”苏菲惊叫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And the next great epoch in the history of mankind is the Baroque. But we shall have to keep that for another day, my dear Hilde."</p>

<p>“下一个人类史上的伟大时期叫做巴洛克时期。不过，我们只好等到下一次再谈了，亲爱的席德。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What did you say?" Sophie shot up from the chair she had been sitting in. "You called me Hilde!"</p>

<p>“你说什么？”苏菲从椅子上跳了起来。“你叫我席德！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That was a serious slip of the tongue."</p>

<p>“是我一时不小心，喊错了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But a slip of the tongue is never wholly accidental."</p>

<p>“可是，无心之言或多或少都是有原因的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You may be right. You'll notice that Hilde's father has begun to put words in our mouths. I think he is exploiting the fact that we are getting weary and are not defending ourselves very well."</p>

<p>“也许你说得对。你可以注意到席德的父亲已经开始透过我们的嘴巴讲话了，我想他是故意趁我们渐渐疲倦，不太能为自己辩护的时候才这样做。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You said once that you are not Hilde's father. Is that really true?"</p>

<p>“你曾经说过你不是席德的爸爸。你可以保证这是真话吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto nodded.</p>

<p>艾伯特点点头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But am I Hilde?"</p>

<p>“但我是席德吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I'm tired now, Sophie. You have to understand that. We have been sitting here for over two hours, and I have been doing most of the talking. Don't you have to go home to eat?"</p>

<p>“我累了，苏菲，请你谅解。我们坐在一起已经两个多小时了，大部分的时间都是我在说话。你不是要回家吃饭吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie felt almost as if he was trying to throw her out. As she went into the little hall, she thought intensely about why he had made that slip. Alberto came out after her.</p>

<p>苏菲觉得艾伯特几乎像是要赶她走似的。当她走进小小的走廊时，心里一直想着他为何会喊错她的名字。艾伯特也跟着她走出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Hermes was lying asleep under a small row of pegs on which hung several strange-looking garments that could have been theatrical costumes. Alberto nodded toward the dog and said, "He will come and fetch you."</p>

<p>汉密士正躺在壁上一排衣钩的下面睡觉。衣钩上挂着几件很像是戏服的怪异服装。艾伯特朝汉密士的方向点点头说：“下次它还是会去接你。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Thank you for my lesson," said Sophie.</p>

<p>“谢谢你为我上课。”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She gave Alberto an impulsive hug. "You're the best and kindest philosophy teacher I've ever had," she said.</p>

<p>她突然冲动地拥抱了艾伯特一下。“你是我所见过的最好、最亲切的哲学老师。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>With that she opened the door to the staircase. As the door closed, Alberto said, "It won't be long before we meet again, Hilde."</p>

<p>然后她把通往楼梯的门打开。在关门之际，艾伯特说：“我们不久就会再见面的，席德！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie was left with those words.</p>

<p>之后门就关上了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Another slip of the tongue, the villain! Sophie had a strong desire to turn around and hammer on the door but something held her back.</p>

<p>又喊错名字了，这个坏蛋！苏菲有一股强烈的冲动想要跑回去敲门，不过她还是没有这样做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>On reaching the street she remembered that she had no money on her. She would have to walk all the long way home. How annoying! Her mother would be both angry and worried if she didn't get back by six, that was for sure.</p>

<p>走到街上时，她突然想起自己身上没钱，必须一路走回家。真气人！如果她在六点前还没回到家，妈妈一定会又生气又着急的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She had not gone more than a few yards when she suddenly noticed a coin on the sidewalk. It was ten crowns, exactly the price of a bus ticket.</p>

<p>苏菲走了几码路后，突然看到人行道上有一枚十元的钱币，正好可以买一张公车票。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie found her way to the bus stop and waited for a bus to the Main Square. From there she could take a bus on the same ticket and ride almost to her door.</p>

<p>苏菲找到了公车站，等候开往大广场的公车。从大广场那儿，她可以换车，一路坐回家门口，不必再买票。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Not until she was standing at the Main Square waiting for the second bus did she begin to wonder why she had been lucky enough to find the coin just when she needed it.</p>

<p>一直到她站在大广场等候下一辆公车时，她才开始纳闷自己为何如此幸运，刚好捡到一个十块钱的铜板。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Could Hilde's father have left it there? He was a master at leaving things in the most convenient places.</p>

<p>难道是席德的爸爸放在那儿的吗？他真是个高手，每次都把东西放得恰到好处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>How could he, if he was in Lebanon?And why had Alberto made that slip? Not once but twice!Sophie shivered. She felt a chill run down her spine.</p>

<p>但是这怎么可能呢？他不是还在黎巴嫩吗？艾伯特又为什么老是喊错她的名字呢？不只一次哦！苏菲打了个冷战。她觉得有一股寒气沿着她的脊梁骨一路窜下来。</p></div>
