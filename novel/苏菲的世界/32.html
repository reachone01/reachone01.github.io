<div class='layout'><p>32 Our Own Time</p><p>32 我们这个时代</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>……man is condemned to be free……</p><p> ……人是注定要受自由之苦的…… </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The alarm clock showed 11:55 p.m. Hilde lay staring at the ceiling. She tried to let her associations flow freely. Each time she finished a chain of thoughts, she tried to ask herself why.</p><p>闹钟显示时间已经是二十三点五十五分了。席德躺在床上，瞪着天花板，试着做一些自由联想。每次她想完了一串事情之后，就问自己为什么会想这些？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Could there be something she was trying to repress?If only she could have set aside all censorship, she might have slid into a waking dream. A bit scary, she thought.</p><p>她可不可能正试图压抑什么事情？她要是能够解除所有的管制就好了，这样也许她就会在醒着时做梦。不过这种想法还真有点吓人，她想。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The more she relaxed and opened herself to random thoughts and images, the more she felt as if she was in the major's cabin by the little lake in the woods.</p><p>她愈放松，让自己胡思乱想，就愈觉得自己好像在林间小湖边的小木屋中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What could Alberto be planning? Of course, it was Hilde's father planning that Alberto was planning something. Did he already know what Alberto would do? Perhaps he was trying to give himself free rein, so that whatever happened in the end would come as a surprise to him too.</p><p>艾伯特的计划会是什么呢？当然，艾伯特拟定计划这件事也是爸爸计划的。他是否已经知道艾伯特会用什么方式反击？也许他也一样试图放任自己的思想，以便制造一个连自己也料想不到的结局吧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were not many pages left now. Should she take a peek at the last page? No, that would be cheating. And besides, Hilde was convinced that it was far from decided what was to happen on the last page.</p><p>剩下的页数已经不多了。她该不该偷看最后一页呢？不，这样等于是作弊了。更何况，席德相信，到目前为止，最后一页会发生什么事都还不确定呢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wasn't that a curious thought? The ring binder was right here and her father could not possibly get back in time to add anything to it. Not unless Alberto did something on his own. A surprise ...</p><p>这不是一种很奇怪的想法吗？讲义夹就在这里，而爸爸毕竟不可能及时赶回来再增添任何东西，除非艾伯特做了什么事。一件令人惊奇的事……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde had a few surprises up her own sleeve, in any case. Her father did not control her. But was she in full control of herself?</p><p>无论如何，席德自己也会想办法让爸爸吓一大跳。他管不到她，可是她又能完全管得住自己吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What was consciousness? Wasn't it one of the greatest riddles of the universe? What was memory? What made us "remember" everything we had seen and experienced?</p><p>意识是什么？它难道不是宇宙的一个大谜题吗？记忆又是什么？是什么东西使我们“记得”我们所看到、所经验到的每一件事情？是</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What kind of mechanism made us create fabulous dreams night after night?</p><p>什么样的机制使我们日复一日地做一些奇妙的梦？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She closed her eyes from time to time. Then she opened them and stared at the ceiling again. At last she forgot to open them.</p><p>她躺在那儿想着这些问题，并不时闭上眼睛，然后又睁开眼睛凝视着天花板。最后她就忘了睁开了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was asleep.</p><p>她睡着了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When the raucous scream of a seagull woke her, Hilde got out of bed. As usual, she crossed the room to the window and stood looking out across the bay. It had gotten to be a habit, summer and winter.</p><p>后来，她被海鸥尖锐的叫声吵醒。她起床走到房间的另一头，像往常一样站在窗前，俯瞰着窗外的海湾。这已经成了她的一个习惯，不管夏天冬天都是如此。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As she stood there, she suddenly felt a myriad of colors exploding in her head. She remembered what she had dreamt. But it felt like more than an ordinary dream, with its vivid colors and shapes ...</p><p>当她站在那儿时，她突然感觉到无数种颜色在她的脑海里爆炸。她想起了自己的梦境，可是感觉上那不只是一个普通的梦，因为梦中的颜色和形状都如此生动逼真……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She had dreamt that her father came home from Lebanon, and the whole dream was an extension of Sophie's dream when she found the gold crucifix on the dock.</p><p>她梦见爸爸从黎巴嫩回到家，而这整个梦是苏菲所做的那个梦的延伸，也就是苏菲在平台上捡到金十字架的那个梦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde was sitting on the edge of the dock--exactly as in Sophie's dream. Then she heard a very soft voice whispering, "My name is Sophie!" Hilde had stayed where she was, sitting very still, trying to hear where the voice was coming from. It continued, an almost inaudible rustling, as if an insect were speaking to her: "You must be both deaf and blind!" Just then her father had come into the garden in his UN uniform. "Hilde!" he shouted. Hilde ran up to him and threw her arms around his neck. That's where the dream ended.</p><p>席德梦见自己正坐在平台的边缘，就像在苏菲梦中那样。然后她听到一个很轻柔的声音说：“我的名字叫苏菲！席德仍旧动也不动地坐在那儿，试着分辨声音的来处。然后那轻得几乎听不见、宛如虫鸣的声音又说了：“你一定是既聋又盲!”就在那个时候，爸爸穿着联合国的制服进入花园。“席德!”他喊。席德冲向他，用双臂围着他的脖子。到这里，梦就结束了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She remembered some lines of a poem by Arnulf 0verland:</p><p>她记得几行欧佛兰(Arnulf Overland)所写的诗：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Wakened one night by a curious dreamand a voice that seemed to be speaking to melike a far-off subterranean stream,I rose and asked: What do you want of me?</p><p>深宵夜里因奇梦而惊醒，恍惚听见一低语的声音，宛如远处那地底的溪流，我起身相询：汝意有何求？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was still standing at the window when her mother came in.</p><p>当妈妈进来时，她仍旧站在窗前。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hi there! Are you already awake?"</p><p>“嘿!你已经醒了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not sure..."</p><p>“我不确定……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'll be home around four, as usual."</p><p>“我大约四点钟会回到家，像平常一样。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Okay, Mom."</p><p>“好。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have a nice vacation day, Hilde!"</p><p>“那就祝你假日愉快啦!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You have a good day too."</p><p>“你也是!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she heard her mother slam the front door, she slipped back into bed with the ring binder.</p><p>一听到妈妈把前门关上的声音，她马上拿着讲义夹溜回床上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm going to dive down into the major's unconscious. That's where I'll be until we meet again."</p><p>“……我要潜进少校的潜意识，一直到下次我们再见面以前，我都会在那儿。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There, yes. Hilde started reading again. She could feel under her right index finger that there were only a few pages left.</p><p>是的，昨天她就看到这里。她用右手的食指摸摸，讲义夹只剩下几页了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Sophie left the major's cabin, she could still see some of the Disney figures at the water's edge, but they seemed to dissolve as she approached them. By the time she reached the boat they had all disappeared.</p><p>苏菲离开少校的小木屋时，仍然可以看到有些迪斯尼的卡通人物还在湖边。可是当她走近时，它们似乎就溶解了。等到她走到小船边时，它们已经完全消失了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While she was rowing she made faces, and after she had pulled the boat up into the reeds on the other side she waved her arms about. She was working desperately to hold the major's attention so that Alberto could sit undisturbed in the cabin.</p><p>她划船到对岸，并把小船拉上岸，放在芦苇丛间。这一路上她一直努力扮鬼脸并挥舞着手臂，拚命地吸引少校的注意力，好让坐在小木屋里的艾伯特能够不受干扰。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She danced along the path, hopping and skipping. Then she tried walking like a mechanical doll. To keep the major interested she began to sing as well. At one point she stood still, pondering what Alberta's plan could be. Catching herself, she got such a bad conscience that she started to climb a tree.</p><p>她一路上不停地又蹦又跳，后来又学机器人走路。为了维持少校对她的兴趣，她甚至开始唱歌。有一次她停了下来，心想艾伯特的计划究竟是什么。可是不一会，她马上制止自己。在罪恶感的驱使下，她开始爬树。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie climbed as high as she could. When she was nearly at the top, she realized she could not get down. She decided to wait a little before trying again. But meanwhile she could not just stay quietly where she was. Then the major would get tired of watching her and would begin to interest himself in what Alberto was doing.</p><p>她尽可能爬到最高的地方。当她快爬到树顶时，突然发现自己下不来。待会儿她会再试一下，但现在她不能就这样坐在树上不动。少校会感到厌烦，然后又会开始好奇艾伯特正在做什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie waved her arms, tried to crow like a rooster a couple of times, and finally began to yodel. It was the first time in her fifteen-year-old life that Sophie had yodeled.All things considered, she was quite pleased with the result.</p><p>于是苏菲挥舞着手臂，并学公鸡叫了两三次，最后开始用假嗓子唱歌，这是她活到十五岁以来第一次用假嗓子唱歌。大致上来说，她对自己的表现相当满意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She tried once more to climb down but she was truly stuck. Suddenly a huge goose landed on one of the branches Sophie was clinging to. Having recently seen a whole swarm of Disney figures, Sophie was not in the least surprised when the goose began to speak.</p><p>她再次试着爬下来，可是她真的是被卡住了。这时，突然有一只大雁飞来，停在苏菲攀住的一根树枝上。苏菲已经看了这么多的迪斯尼人物，因此当那只雁开口跟她说话时，她一点也不惊讶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My name is Morten," said the goose. "Actually, I'm a tame goose, but on this special occasion I have flown up from Lebanon with the wild geese. You look as if you could use some help getting down from this tree."</p><p>“我叫莫通，”大雁说。“事实上我是一只家雁，可是由于情况特殊，我便和别的野雁一起从黎巴嫩飞到这里来。看起来你好像需要帮忙才能爬下来。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You are much too small to help me," said Sophie.</p><p>“你太小了，帮不上忙。”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You are jumping to conclusions, young lady. It is you who are too big."</p><p>“小姐，你的结论下得大早了。应该说你自己太大才对。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's the same thing, isn't it?"</p><p>“这不是一样吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I would have you know I carried a peasant boy exactly your age all over Sweden. His name was Nils Hol-gersson."</p><p>“告诉你，我曾经载着一个年纪跟你一样大的乡下小男孩飞过全瑞典。他的名字叫尼尔·侯格森(Nils Ho1gersson)。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I am fifteen."</p><p>“我今年十五岁了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And Nils was fourteen. A year one way or the other makes no difference to the freight."</p><p>“尼尔十四岁。加减个一岁对体重不会有影响。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How did you manage to lift him?"</p><p>“你怎么把他载起来的？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I gave him a little slap and he passed out. When he woke up, he was no bigger than a thumb."</p><p>“我打他一巴掌，他就昏过去了。当他醒来时，身体就跟一根拇指一样大。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Perhaps you could give me a little slap too, because I can't sit up here forever. And I'm giving a philosophical garden party on Saturday."</p><p>“也许你也可以轻轻地打我一巴掌，因为我不能一直坐在这里。星期六我就要办一场哲学花园宴会了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's interesting. I presume this is a philosophy book, then. When I was flying over Sweden with Nils Holgers-son, we touched down on Marbacka in Varmland, where Nils met an old woman who was planning to write a book about Sweden for schoolchildren. It was to be both instructive and true, she said. When she heard about Nils's adventures, she decided to write a book about all the things he had seen on gooseback."</p><p>“这倒挺有意思的。那我猜这大概是一本有关哲学的书。当我载着尼尔飞在瑞典上空时，我们在法姆兰区(Varmland)的马贝卡(Marbacka)着陆。尼尔在那儿遇见一位老妇人。她正计划为学童写一本有关瑞典的书。她说，这本书既要真实又要有教育价值。当她听到尼尔的奇遇时，便决定写一本有关他在雁背上所见到的事物的书。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That was very strange."</p><p>“这很奇怪。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To tell you the truth it was rather ironic, because we were already in that book."</p><p>“老实告诉你吧，这是很反讽的，因为我们已经在那本书里面了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly Sophie felt something slap her cheek and the next minute she had become no bigger than a thumb. The tree was like a whole forest and the goose was as big as a horse.</p><p>突然间苏菲觉得某个东西在她的脸颊上掴了一下，她立刻变成像拇指一样小。那棵树变得像一座森林，而那只雁也变得像马一样大了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come on, then," said the goose.</p><p>“来吧，“大雁说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie walked along the branch and climbed up on the goose's back. Its feathers were soft, but now that she was so small, they pricked her more than they tickled.</p><p>苏菲沿着树枝向前走，然后爬到大雁的背上。它的羽毛很柔软，可是由于她现在实在太小了，那些羽毛不时戳着她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As soon as she had settled comfortably the goose took off. They flew high above the treetops. Sophie looked down at the lake and the major's cabin. Inside sat Al-berto, laying his devious plans.</p><p>她一坐好，大雁就起飞了。他们飞到树林上方，苏菲向下看着小湖和少校的小木屋。艾伯特正坐在里面，拟定着他那秘密计划。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A short sightseeing tour will have to be sufficient today," said the goose, flapping its wings again and again.</p><p>“今天我们小小地观光一下就好了。”大雁边说边拍着翅膀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With that, it flew in to land at the foot of the tree which Sophie had so recently begun to climb. As the goose touched down Sophie tumbled onto the ground. After rolling around in the heather a few times, she sat up. She realized with amazement that she was her full size again.</p><p>之后，它便向下飞，停在苏菲刚才爬的那棵树下。大雁着陆时，苏菲便滚到了地上。在石南丛里滚了几下后，她便坐起来，很惊讶地发现自己又回复原来的身高了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The goose waddled around her a few times.</p><p>大雁摇摇摆摆地在她的四周走了几圈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thanks a lot for your help," said Sophie.</p><p>“谢谢你帮我的忙。”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was a mere bagatelle. Did you say this was a philosophy book?"</p><p>“小事一桩。你是不是说过这是一本有关哲学的书？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, that's what you said."</p><p>“不，那是你说的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh well, it's all the same. If it had been up to me, I would have liked to fly you through the whole history of philosophy just as I flew Nils Holgersson through Sweden. We could have circled over Miletus and Athens, Jerusalem and Alexandria, Rome and Florence, London and Paris, Jena and Heidelberg, Berlin and Copenhagen . . ."</p><p>“好吧，反正都一样。如果我能作主的话，我会载着你飞过整部哲学史，就像我载尼尔飞过瑞典一样。我们可以在米雷特斯和雅典、耶路撒冷和亚力山卓、罗马和佛罗伦萨、伦敦和巴黎、耶纳和海德堡、柏林和哥本哈根这些城市的上空盘旋。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thanks, that's enough."</p><p>“谢谢你，这样就够了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But flying across the centuries would have been a hefty job even for a very ironic goose. Crossing the Swedish provinces is far easier."</p><p>“可是飞越这么多世纪，即使对一只非常反讽的雁来说，也是很辛苦的。所以飞越瑞典各省要容易多了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So saying, the goose ran a few steps and flapped itself into the air.</p><p>说完后，大雁跑了几步，就拍拍翅膀飞到空中去了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie was exhausted, but when she crawled out of the den into the garden a little later she thought Alberto would have been well pleased with her diversionary maneuvers. The major could not have thought much about Alberto during the past hour. If he did, he had to have a severe case of split personality.</p><p>苏菲已经很累了。不久后当她爬出密洞时，心想艾伯特对她这些调虎离山的计策必然很满意。在过去这个小时内，少校一定不可能花太多心思在艾伯特身上，否则他一定得了严重的人格分裂症。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie had just walked in the front door when her mother came home from work. That saved her having to describe her rescue from a tall tree by a tame goose.</p><p>苏菲刚从前门进屋，妈妈就下班回家了。还好是这样，否则她怎么解释她被一只家雁从一棵大树上救下来的事呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After dinner they began to get everything ready for the garden party. They brought a four-meter-long table top and trestles from the attic and carried it into the garden.</p><p>吃过晚餐后，她们开始准备花园宴会的事情。她们从阁楼里拿出了一张四公尺长的桌面，并把它抬到花园里。然后她们又回到阁楼去拿桌脚。她们已经计划好要把那张长桌子放在果树下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They had planned to set out the long table under the fruit trees. The last time they had used the trestle table had been on Sophie's parents' tenth anniversary. Sophie was only eight years old at the time, but she clearly remembered the big outdoor party with all their friends and relatives.</p><p>上一次他们用到那张长桌是在苏菲的爸妈结婚十周年庆的时候。那时苏菲只有八岁，但她仍然很清楚地记得那次各方亲朋好友云集的盛大露天宴会。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The weather report was as good as it could be. There had not been as much as a drop of rain since that horrid thunderstorm the day before Sophie's birthday. Nevertheless they decided to leave the actual table setting and decorating until Saturday morning.</p><p>气象报告说星期六将会是个好天气。自从苏菲生日前一天的可怕暴风雨后，她们那儿连一滴雨也没下。不过，她们还是决定等到时期六上午再来布置和装饰餐桌。可是妈妈认为目前至少可以先把桌子搬到花园里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Later that evening they baked two different kinds of bread. They were going to serve chicken and salad. And sodas. Sophie was worried that some of the boys in her class would bring beer. If there was one thing she was afraid of it was trouble.</p><p>那天晚上她们烤了一些小圆面包和几条由两种面团做成的乡村面包。请客的菜是鸡和沙拉，还有汽水。苏菲很担心她班上的一些男孩子可能会带啤酒来。她天不怕地不怕，就是怕惹麻烦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As Sophie was going to bed, her mother asked her once again if Alberto was coming to the party.</p><p>苏菲正要上床睡觉时，妈妈又问了一次艾伯特是否一定会来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course he's coming. He has even promised to do a philosophical trick."</p><p>“他当然会来。他甚至答应我要玩一个哲学的小把戏。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A philosophical trick? What kind of trick is that?"</p><p>“一个哲学的小把戏？那是什么样的把戏？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No idea ……if he were a magician, he would have done a magic trick. He would probably have pulled a white rabbit out of a hat. . ."</p><p>“我不知道……如果他是一个魔术师，他可能就会表演魔术。也许他会从帽子里变出一只白兔来……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What, again?"</p><p>“什么？又玩这一套呀？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But since he's a philosopher, he's going to do a philosophical trick instead. After all, it is a philosophical garden party. Are you planning to do something too?"</p><p>“……可是他是个哲学家，他要耍的是一个哲学的把戏，因为这毕竞是个哲学的花园宴会呀。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“你这个顽皮鬼。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“你有没有想过你自己要做什么呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Actually, I am."</p><p>“老实说，我有。我想做点事。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A speech?"</p><p>“发表一篇演讲吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not telling. Good night, Sophie!"</p><p>“我不告诉你。晚安!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Early the next morning Sophie was woken up by her mother, who came in to say goodbye before she went to work. She gave Sophie a list of last-minute things to buy in town for the garden party.</p><p>第二天一大早苏菲就被妈妈叫起床了。妈妈是来跟她说再见的，因为她要上班去了。她给了苏菲一张单子，上面列着所有花园宴会要用的物品，要她到镇上采买。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The minute her mother had left the house, the telephone rang. It was Alberto. He had obviously found out exactly when Sophie was home alone.</p><p>妈妈刚出门，电话就响了。是艾伯特打来的。他显然知道苏菲什么时候会一个人在家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How is your secret coming along?"</p><p>“你的秘密计划进行得如何了？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ssh! Not a word. Don't even give him the chance to think about it."</p><p>“嘘！不要提。别让他有机会去想它。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think I held his attention yesterday "</p><p>“我想我昨天已经很成功地让他一直注意我了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Good."</p><p>“很好。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is the philosophy course finished?"</p><p>“我们还有哲学课要上吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's why I'm calling. We're already in our own century. From now on you should be able to orient yourself on your own. The foundations were the most important. But we must nevertheless meet for a short talk about our own time "</p><p>“我就是为了这个才打电话来的。我们已经讲到现代了，从现在起，你应该可以不需要老师了，因为打基础是最重要的。可是我们还得见个面，稍微谈一下我们这个时代的哲学。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But I have to go to town . .  "</p><p>“可是我得到镇上去……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's excellent. I said it was our own time we had to talk about."</p><p>“那好极了，我说过我们要谈的是我们这个时代。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Really?"</p><p>“真的吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So it would be most practical to meet in town, I mean."</p><p>“所以我们在镇上见面是很恰当的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Shall I come to your place?"</p><p>“你要我到你那儿去吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, no, not here Everything's a mess. I've been hunting for hidden microphones."</p><p>“不，不要到这里来。我这里乱七八糟的，因为我到处搜寻，看有没有什么窃听装置。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah!"</p><p>“啊！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There's a cafe that's just opened at the Main Square. Cafe Pierre. Do you know it?"</p><p>“大广场上有一家新开的咖啡厅，叫做皮尔咖啡厅。你知道吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. When shall I be there?"</p><p>“我知道。我要什么时候到呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Can we meet at twelve?"</p><p>“十二点好吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“那就十二点在咖啡厅碰面。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“就这么说定了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Okay. Bye!"</p><p>“再见!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At a couple of minutes past twelve Sophie walked into Cafe Pierre. It was one of those new fashionable places with little round tables and black chairs, upturned vermouth bottles in dispensers, baguettes, and sandwiches.</p><p>十二点过两三分时，苏菲走进了皮尔咖啡厅。这是一家很时髦的咖啡厅，有小小的圆桌和黑色的椅子。贩卖机里摆着倒过来放的一瓶瓶艾酒，还有法国长条面包和三明治。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The room was small, and the first thing Sophie noticed was that Alberto was not there. A lot of other people were sitting at the round tables, but Sophie saw only that Alberto was not among them.</p><p>咖啡厅并不大。苏菲首先注意到的就是艾伯特并不在里面。老实说，这是她唯一注意到的地方。有许多人围着几张餐桌坐，可是苏菲只看到艾伯特不在这些人里面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was not in the habit of going into cafes on her own. Should she just turn around and leave, and come back later to see if he had arrived?She ordered a cup of lemon tea at the marble bar and sat down at one of the vacant tables. She stared at the door. People came and went all the time, but there was still no Alberto.</p><p>她并不习惯一个人上咖啡厅。她该不该转身走出去，稍后再回来看看他到了没有呢？她走到大理石吧台那儿，要了一杯柠檬茶。她端了茶杯走到一张空桌子坐下来，并注视着门口。这里不断有人来来去去，可是苏菲只注意到艾伯特还没有来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If only she had a newspaper!As time passed, she started to look around. She got a couple of glances in return. For a moment Sophie felt like a young woman. She was only fifteen, but she could certainly have passed for seventeen--or at least, sixteen and a half.</p><p>她要是有一份报纸就好了!随着时间一分分过去，她忍不住看看四周的人，也有几个人回看她。有一段时间苏菲觉得自己像一个年轻的女郎。她今年只有十五岁，可是她自认看起来应该有十七岁，要不然至少也有十六岁半。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She wondered what all these people thought about being alive. They looked as though they had simply dropped in, as though they had just sat down here by chance. They were all talking away, gesticulating vehemently, but it didn't look as though they were talking about anything that mattered.</p><p>她心想，这些人对活着这件事不知道怎么想。他们看起来仿佛只是顺道经过，偶然进来坐坐似的。他们一个个都在比手画脚的谈话，可是看起来他们说得好像也不是什么重要的事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She suddenly came to think of Kierkegaard, who had said that what characterized the crowd most was their idle chatter. Were all these people living at the aesthetic stage? Or was there something that was existentially important to them?</p><p>她突然想到祁克果，他曾经说过群众最大的特色就是喜欢言不及义地闲扯。这些人是不是还活在美感阶段呢？有没有一件事是对他们的存在有意义的呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In one of his early letters to her Alberto had talked about the similarity between children and philosophers. She realized again that she was afraid of becoming an adult. Suppose she too ended up crawling deep down into the fur of the white rabbit that was pulled out of the universe's top hat!</p><p>艾伯特在初期写给她的一封信中曾经谈到儿童与哲学家之间的相似性。她又再一次有不想长大的念头。搞不好她也会变成一只爬到兔子毛皮深处的虱子!</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She kept her eyes on the door. Suddenly Alberto walked in. Although it was midsummer, he was wearing a black beret and a gray hip-length coat of herringbone tweed. He hurried over to her. It felt very strange to meet him in public.</p><p>她一边想，一边注意看着门口。突然间艾伯特从外面的街上缓缓走进来了。虽然已经是仲夏天，但他还是戴着一顶黑扁帽，穿着一件灰色有人字形花纹的苏格兰呢短外套。他立刻看到苏菲，便急忙走过来。苏菲心想，他们以前好像从来没有在公开场合见过面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's quarter past twelve!"</p><p>“现在已经十二点十五分了，你这个烂人。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's what is known as the academic quarter of an hour. Would you like a snack?"</p><p>“这十五分是有教育意义。我可以请你这位年轻的小姐吃些点心吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He sat down and looked into her eyes. Sophie shrugged.</p><p>他坐下来，看着她的眼睛。苏菲耸耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sure. A sandwich, maybe."</p><p>“随便，一个三明治好了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto went up to the counter. He soon returned with a cup of coffee and two baguette sandwiches with cheese and ham.</p><p>艾伯特走到吧台那儿。不久他便端着一杯咖啡和两个乳酪火腿三明治回来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Was it expensive?"</p><p>“贵不贵呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A bagatelle, Sophie."</p><p>“小事一桩。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you have any excuse at all for being late?"</p><p>“你为什么迟到呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No. I did it on purpose. I'll explain why presently."</p><p>“我是故意的。我很快就会告诉你为什么。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He took a few large bites of his sandwich. Then he said:"Let's talk about our own century."</p><p>他咬了一大口三明治。然后他说道：“我们今天要谈我们这个时代的哲学。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Has anything of philosophical interest happened?"</p><p>“有什么重要的哲学事件发生吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>存在哲学</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Lots ……movements are going off in all directions We'll start with one very important direction, and that is existentialism. This is a collective term for several philosophical currents that take man's existential situation as their point of departure. We generally talk of twentieth-century existential philosophy. Several of these existential philosophers, or existentialists, based their ideas not only on Kierkegaard, but on Hegel and Marx as well."</p><p>“很多……各种潮流都有。我们要先讲一个非常重要的潮流，就是存在主义。这是一个集合名词，代表几股以人存在的情况为出发点的哲学潮流。我们通常谈的是二十世纪的存在哲学。这些存在主义哲学家中有几个是以祁克果，乃至黑格尔等人的学说为基础的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Uh-huh."</p><p>“嗯。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Another important philosopher who had a great influence on the twentieth century was the German Friedrich Nietzsche, who lived from 1844 to 1900. He, too, reacted against Hegel's philosophy and the German 'historicism.' He proposed life itself as a counterweight to the anemic interest in history and what he called the Christian 'slave morality.' </p><p>“另外一个对二十世纪有很大影响的哲学家是德国的尼采(Friedrich Nietzsche)，生于一八四四到一九OO年间。他同样反对黑格尔的哲学以及德国的‘历史主义’，他认为我们应该重视生命本身，而不必对历史和他所谓的基督教的‘奴隶式道德’过于注意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He sought to effect a 'revaluation of all values,' so that the life force of the strongest should not be hampered by the weak. According to Nietzsche, both Christianity and traditional philosophy had turned away from the real world and pointed toward 'heaven' or 'the world of ideas.' But what had hitherto been considered the 'real' world was in fact a pseudo world. 'Be true to the world,' he said. 'Do not listen to those who offer you supernatural expectations.' "</p><p>他希望能够造成‘对所有价值的重新评价’，使强者的生命力不会受到弱者的拖累。根据尼采的说法，基督教和传统哲学已经脱离了真实世界，朝向‘天堂’或‘观念世界’发展，而人们过去认为的‘真实’世界事实上是一个‘伪世界’。他说：‘要忠于这个世界。不要听信那些让你有超自然期望的人。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So ……?"</p><p>“然后呢？”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A man who was influenced by both Kierkegaard and Nietzsche was the German existential philosopher Martin Heidegger. But we are going to concentrate on the French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre, who lived from 1905 to 1980. He was the leading light among the existentialists--at least, to the broader public. His existentialism became especially popular in the forties, just after the war. Later on he allied himself with the Marxist movement in France, but he never became a member of any party."</p><p>“祁克果和尼采两人同时又影响了德国的存在主义哲学家海德格(Martin Heidegger)。可是我们现在要专门来谈法国存在主义哲学家萨特(Jean—Paul Sartre)。他生于一九O五到一九八O年间，是存在主义者(至少是信奉存在主义的一般大众)的领袖。他的存在主义在第二次世界大战后的一九四O年左右尤其风行。后来他与法国的马克思主义运动结盟，但他本人从来没有加入任何党派。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Is that why we are meeting in a French cafe?"</p><p>“是因为这样我们才在一家法国咖啡厅见面吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "It was not quite accidental, I confess. Sartre himself spent a lot of time in cafes. He met his life-long companion Simone de Beauvoir in a cafe. She was also an existential philosopher."</p><p>“我承认这是有目的的。萨特本人经常出入咖啡厅。他就是在这样的咖啡厅里遇见他终身的伴侣西蒙波娃(Simonede Beauvoir)的。她也是一位存在主义的哲学家。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A woman philosopher?"</p><p>“一位女哲学家？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's right."</p><p>“对。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What a relief that humanity is finally becoming civilized."</p><p>“大好了，人类终于变得比较文明了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nevertheless, many new problems have arisen in our own time."</p><p>“可是我们这个时代也有很多新的问题。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You were going to talk about existentialism."</p><p>“你要讲的是存在主义。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sartre said that 'existentialism is humanism.' By that he meant that the existentialists start from nothing but humanity itself. I might add that the humanism he was referring to took a far bleaker view of the human situation than the humanism we met in the Renaissance."</p><p>“萨特说：‘存在主义就是人文主义。’他的意思是存在主义者乃是以人类为出发点。必须说明的是：他的人文主义对于人类处境的观点要比文艺复兴时代的人主主义者悲观得多。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why was that?"</p><p>“为什么呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Both Kierkegaard and some of this century's existential philosophers were Christian. But Sartre's allegiance was to what we might call an atheistic existentialism. His philosophy can be seen as a merciless analysis of the human situation when 'God is dead.' The expression 'God is dead' came from Nietzsche."</p><p>“祁克果和本世纪的若干存在主义哲学家都是基督徒，但萨特所信仰的却是所谓的‘无神论的存在主义’。他的哲学可以说是在‘上帝已死’的情况下对人类处境所做的无情分析。‘上帝已死’这句话是尼采说的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Go on."</p><p>“说下去。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The key word in Sartre's philosophy, as in Kierkegaard's, is 'existence.' But existence did not mean the same as being alive. Plants and animals are also alive, they exist, but they do not have to think about what it implies. Man is the only living creature that is conscious of its own existence. Sartre said that a material thing is simply 'in itself,' but mankind is 'for itself.' The being of man is therefore not the same as the being of things."</p><p>“萨特和祁克果的哲学中最主要的一个字眼就是‘存在’。但存在不等于活着。植物和动物也活着，它们虽然存在，但并不需要思考存在的意义。人是唯一意识到自己存在的生物。萨特表示，一个东西只是在己(in itself)而人类却是为已(for itself)。因此人的存在并不等于东西的存在。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can't disagree with that."</p><p>“我同意。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sartre said that man's existence takes priority over whatever he might otherwise be. The fact that I exist takes priority over what I am. 'Existence takes priority over essence.' "</p><p>“萨特进一步宣称，人的存在比任何其他事情都重要。我存在的这个事实比我是谁要更加重要。他说：‘存在先于本质。，” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That was a very complicated statement."</p><p>“这句话很复杂。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"By essence we mean that which something consists of--the nature, or being, of something. But according to Sartre, man has no such innate 'nature.' Man must therefore create himself. He must create his own nature or 'essence,' because it is not fixed in advance."</p><p>“所谓的本质是指组成某些事物的东西，也就是说某些事物的本性。但根据萨特的说法，人并没有这种天生的‘本性’，因此人必须创造自我。他必须创造自己的本性或‘本质’，因为他的本性并非是一生下来就固定的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think I see what you mean."</p><p>“我明白了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Throughout the entire history of philosophy, philosophers have sought to discover what man is--or what human nature is. But Sartre believed that man has no such eternal 'nature' to fall back on. It is therefore useless to search for the meaning of life in general. We are condemned to improvise. We are like actors dragged onto the stage without having learned our lines, with no script and no prompter to whisper stage directions to us. We must decide for ourselves how to live."</p><p>“在整部哲学史中，哲学家们一直想要探索人的本性。但萨特相信，人并没有一种不变的‘本性’。因此，追求广泛的生命的‘意识’是没有用的。换句话说，我们是注定要自己创造这种意义。我们就像是还没背好台词就被拉上舞台的演员，没有剧本，也没有提词人低声告诉我们应该怎么做。我们必须自己决定该怎么活。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's true, actually. If one could just look in the Bible--or in a philosophy book--to find out how to live, it would be very practical."</p><p>“事实上，真的是这样。如果我们能在圣经或哲学教科书中学到该怎么活，就很有用了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You've got the point. When people realize they are alive and will one day die--and there is no meaning to cling to--they experience angst, said Sartre. You may recall that angst, a sense of dread, was also characteristic of Kierkegaard's description of a person in an existential situation."</p><p>“你讲到要点了。但萨特说，当人领悟到他们活在世上，总有一天会死，而且没有什么意义可以攀附时，他们就会愈加恐惧。你可能还记得祁克果在形容人存在的处境时，也用过这个字眼。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes."</p><p>“嗯。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sartre says that man feels a//en in a world without meaning. When he describes man's 'alienation,' he is echoing the central ideas of Hegel and Marx. Man's feeling of alienation in the world creates a sense of despair, boredom, nausea, and absurdity."</p><p>“萨特又说，人在一个没有意义的世界中会感到疏离。当他描述人的‘疏离’时，乃是重复黑格尔的中心思想。人的这种疏离感会造成绝望、烦闷、厌恶和荒谬等感觉。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It is quite normal to feel depressed, or to feel that everything is just too boring."</p><p>“感觉沮丧或觉得一切都很无聊是很正常的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, indeed. Sartre was describing the twentieth-century city dweller. You remember that the Renaissance humanists had drawn attention, almost triumphantly, to man's freedom and independence? Sartre experienced man's freedom as a curse. 'Man is condemned to be free,' he said. 'Condemned because he has not created himself--and is nevertheless free. Because having once been hurled into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.' "</p><p>“的确如此。萨特所描述的乃是二十世纪的城市人。你也许还记得文艺复兴时期的人文主义者曾经兴高采烈地强调人的自由与独立。萨特则觉得人的自由是一种诅咒。他说：‘人是注定要受自由之苦的。因为他并没有创造自己，但却是自由的。因为一旦被扔进这个世界里来，他就必须为他所做的每一件事负责。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But we haven't asked to be created as free individuals."</p><p>“可是我们并没有要求被创造成自由的个体。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That was precisely Sartre's point. Nevertheless we are free individuals, and this freedom condemns us to make choices throughout our lives. There are no eternal values or norms we can adhere to, which makes our choices even more significant. Because we are totally responsible for everything we do. Sartre emphasized that man must never disclaim the responsibility for his actions. Nor can we avoid the responsibility of making our own choices on the grounds that we 'must' go to work, or we 'must' live up to certain middle-class expectations regarding how we should live. Those who thus slip into the anonymous masses will never be other than members of the impersonal flock, having fled from themselves into self-deception. On the other hand our freedom obliges us to make something of ourselves, to live 'authentically' or 'truly.' "</p><p>“这正是萨特所要说的。可是我们仍然是自由的个体，而这种自由使我们注定一生中要不断地做选择。世上没有我们必须遵守的永恒价值或规范，这使得我们的选择更加有意义。因为我们要为自己所做的事负全责。萨特强调，人绝对不能放弃他对自己行动的责任，也不能以我们‘必须’上班、‘必须’符合中产阶级对我们生活方式的期望为理由。逃避为自己做选择的责任。如果我们逃避这项责任，就会沦为无名大众的一分子，将永远只是一个没有个性的群体之一，逃避自我并自我欺骗。从另外一方面来说，我们的自由迫使我们要成为某种人物，要‘真实’地活着。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I see."</p><p>“嗯，我明白了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This is not least the case as regards our ethical choices. We can never lay the blame on 'human nature,' or 'human frailty' or anything like that. Now and then it happens that grown men behave like pigs and then blame it on 'the old Adam.' But there is no 'old Adam.' He is merely a figure we clutch at to avoid taking responsibility for our own actions."</p><p>“在道德的抉择上也是如此。我们永远不能把错误归咎于‘人性’或‘人的软弱’等等。我们可以发现时常有成年男子做出种种令人厌恶的行为，却把这样的行为归咎于‘男人天生的坏毛病’。可是世上没有‘男人天生的坏毛病’这种东西，那只是我们用来避免为自己的行为负责的借口罢了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There ought to be a limit to what man can be blamed for."</p><p>“总不能把样样事情都怪在它头上。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Although Sartre claimed there was no innate meaning to life, he did not mean that nothing mattered. He was not what we call a nihilist."</p><p>“虽然萨特宣称生命并没有固有的意义，但他的意思并不是说什么事情都不重要。他不是我们所谓的‘虚无主义者’。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is that?"</p><p>“什么是虚无主义者？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That is a person who thinks nothing means anything and everything is permissible. Sartre believed that life must have meaning. It is an imperative. But it is we ourselves who must create this meaning in our own lives. To exist is to create your own life."</p><p>“就是那些认为没有一件事情有意义，怎样都可以的人。萨特认为生命应该有意义，这是一个命令。但我们生命中的意义必须由我们自己来创造，存在的意义就是要创造自己的生命。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Could you elaborate on that?" </p><p>“你可以说得详细一点吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sartre tried to prove that consciousness in itself is nothing until it has perceived something. Because consciousness is always conscious of something. And this 'something' is provided just as much by ourselves as by our surroundings. We are partly instrumental in deciding what we perceive by selecting what is significant for us."</p><p>“萨特想要证明意识本身在感知某件事物之前是不存在的。因为意识总是会意识到某件事物。这个‘事物’固然是由我们的环境提供的，但也是由我们自己提供的。我们可以选择对我们有意义的事物，借以决定我们所要感知的事物。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Could you give me an example?"</p><p>“你可以举个例子吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Two people can be present in the same room and yet experience it quite differently. This is because we contribute our own meaning--or our own interests--when we perceive our surroundings. A woman who is pregnant might think she sees other pregnant women everywhere she looks. That is not because there were no pregnant women before, but because now that she is pregnant she sees the world through different eyes. An escaped convict may see policemen everywhere ..."</p><p>“例如同一个房间内的两个人对于这个房间的感受可能大不相同，这是因为当我们感知我们的环境时，会赋予它我们本身的意义(或我们的利益)。一个怀孕的女人也许会认为她走到哪里都可以看见别的孕妇，这并不是因为从前没有孕妇，而是因为她自己怀孕这件事使得每一件事在她眼中都有了新的意义。一个生病的人也许会认为到处都看得见救护车……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Mm, I see."</p><p>“嗯，我明白了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Our own lives influence the way we perceive things in the room. If something is of no interest to me, I don't see it. So now I can perhaps explain why I was late to-day."</p><p>“我们本身的生活会影响我们对这房间内事物的看法。如果某件事情与我无关，我就看不见它。所以我现在也许可以告诉你我今天为什么迟到了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was on purpose, right?"</p><p>“你是有目的的，对吧？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Tell me first of all what you saw when you came in here."</p><p>“你先告诉我你进来时看到什么。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The first thing I saw was that you weren't here."</p><p>“我注意到的第一件事就是你不在这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Isn't it strange that the first thing you noticed was something that was absent?"</p><p>“你看到的第一件事物却是一件不在这里的事物，这不是很奇怪吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Maybe, but it was you I was supposed to meet."</p><p>“也许吧。可是我要见的人是你呀。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Sartre uses just such a cafe visit to demonstrate the way we 'annihilate' whatever is irrelevant for us."</p><p>“萨特就曾经用过一次这样的咖啡厅之行说明我们如何‘虚无化’与我们无关的事物。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You got here late just to demonstrate that?"</p><p>“你迟到就是为了要说明这点？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To enable you to understand this central point in Sartre's philosophy, yes. Call it an exercise."</p><p>“是的，我想让你了解这个萨特哲学中的主要重点。你可以说这是一次演习。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Get out of here!"</p><p>“少来!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If you were in love, and were waiting for your loved one to call you, you might 'hear' him not calling you all evening. You arrange to meet him at the train; crowds of people are milling about on the platform and you can't see him anywhere. They are all in the way, they are unimportant to you. You might find them aggravating, un-pleasant even. They are taking up far too much room. The only thing you register is that he is not there."</p><p>“当你谈恋爱，正等着你的爱人打电话给你时，你可能整晚都会‘听见’他没有打电话给你。因为你整个晚上注意到的就是他没有打电话来。当你跟他约好在火车站见面时，月台上人来人往，而你没有看见他。这些人都在那儿，但他们对你却是不重要的。你甚至可能觉得他们很讨厌，因为他们占去大多空间了。你唯一注意到的事情就是他不在那儿。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How sad."</p><p>“多悲哀呀。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Simone de Beauvoir attempted to apply existentialism to feminism. Sartre had already said that man has no basic 'nature' to fall back on. We create ourselves."</p><p>“西蒙波娃曾试图将存在主义应用到女性主义上。萨特已经说过，人没有基本的‘本性’。我们必须创造自我。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Really?"</p><p>“真的吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "This is also true of the way we perceive the sexes. Simone de Beauvoir denied the existence of a basic 'female nature' or 'male nature.' For instance, it has been generally claimed that man has a 'transcending,' or achieving, nature. He will therefore seek meaning and direction outside the home. Woman has been said to have the opposite life philosophy. She is 'immanent,' which means she wishes to be where she is. She will therefore nurture her family, care for the environment and more homely things. Nowadays we might say that women are more concerned with 'feminine values' than men."</p><p>“我们对于两性的看法也是这样。西蒙波娃否认一般人所谓的‘女人的天性’或‘男人的天性’。举例来说，一般人都说男人有所谓的‘超越的’或‘追求成功’的天性，因此他们会在家庭以外的地方追求意义和方向。而女人则被认为具有与男人完全相反的生活哲学。她们是所谓‘内在的’，意思就是说她们希望留在原地。因此她们会做养育小孩、整理环境等比较与家庭有关的事。今天我们也许会说妇女要比男人关心‘女性的价值’。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Did she really believe that?"</p><p>“她真的相信那些话吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You weren't listening to me. Simone de Beauvoir in fact did not believe in the existence of any such 'female nature' or 'male nature.' On the contrary, she believed that women and men must liberate themselves from such ingrown prejudices or ideals."</p><p>“你没有在听我说。事实上，西蒙波娃不相信有任何这种‘女人天性’或‘男人天性’存在。相反的，她相信女人和男人都必须挣脱这种内在偏见或理想的束缚。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I agree."</p><p>“我同意。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Her main work, published in 1949, was called The Second Sex."</p><p>“她主要的作品名叫《第二性》，一九四九年出版。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What did she mean by that?"</p><p>“第二性是什么意思？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She was talking about women. In our culture women are treated as the second sex. Men behave as if they are the subjects, treating women like their objects, thus depriving them of the responsibility for their own life."</p><p>“她指的是女人。在我们的文化里，妇女是被当成‘第二性’的。男人好像把她们当做臣民，把女人当成是他们的所有物，因此剥夺了她们对自己生命的责任。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She meant we women are exactly as free and independent as we choose to be?"</p><p>“她的意思是只要我们愿意，我们就可以自由独立？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, you could put it like that. Existentialism also had a great influence on literature, from the forties to the present day, especially on drama. Sartre himself wrote plays as well as novels. Other important writers were the Frenchman Albert Camus, the Irishman Samuel Beckett, Eugene lonesco, who was from Romania, and Witold Gombro-wicz from Poland. Their characteristic style, and that of many other modern writers, was what we call absurdism. The term is especially used about the 'theater of the absurd.' "</p><p>“是的，可以这么说。存在主义对于四十年代到现在的文学也有很大的影响。其中包括戏剧在内。萨特本身除了写小说外，也写了一些剧本。其他几位重要的作家包括法国的卡缪、爱尔兰的贝克特、罗马尼亚的伊欧涅思柯和波兰的康布罗维区(Gombrowich)。他们和其他许多现代作家的典型风格就是我们所说的‘荒谬主义’。这个名词专门用来指‘荒谬剧场’。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah."</p><p>“啊。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Do you know what we mean by the 'absurd'?"</p><p>“你知道‘荒谬’的意思吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Isn't it something that is meaningless or irrational?"</p><p>“不就是指没有意义或非理性的事物吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Precisely. The theater of the absurd represented a contrast to realistic theater. Its aim was to show the lack of meaning in life in order to get the audience to disagree. The idea was not to cultivate the meaningless. On the contrary. But by showing and exposing the absurd in ordinary everyday situations, the onlookers are forced to seek a truer and more essential life for themselves."</p><p>“一点没错。‘荒谬剧场’是‘写实剧场’的相反。它的目的在显示生命的没有意义，以使观众起而反对。它的用意并不是鼓吹人生没有意义，其实正好相反。他们借着显示、揭发日常生活情境的荒谬，进而迫使旁观者追求较为真实而有意义的生命。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It sounds interesting."</p><p>“听起来挺有意思的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The theater of the absurd often portrays situations that are absolutely trivial. It can therefore also be called a kind of 'hyperrealism.' People are portrayed precisely as they are. But if you reproduce on stage exactly what goes on in the bathroom on a perfectly ordinary morning in a perfectly ordinary home, the audience would laugh. Their laughter could be interpreted as a defense mechanism against seeing themselves lampooned on stage."</p><p>“荒谬剧场经常描绘一些非常琐碎的情境，因此我们也可以称之为一种‘超写实主义’。剧中描绘的就是人们原来的面貌。可是当你把发生在浴室的事情或一个普通家庭平日早晨的景象搬上舞台时，观众就会觉得很好笑。他们的笑声可以解释成为一种看见自己在舞台上被嘲弄时的防卫机制。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, exactly."</p><p>“正是如此。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The absurd theater can also have certain surrealistic features. Its characters often find themselves in highly unrealistic and dreamlike situations. When they accept this without surprise, the audience is compelled to react in surprise at the characters' lack of surprise. This was how Charlie Chaplin worked in his silent movies. The comic effect in these silent movies was often Chaplin's laconic acceptance of all the absurd things that happen to him. That compelled the audience to look into themselves for something more genuine and true."</p><p>“荒谬剧场也可能具有若干超现实的特色。其中的角色时常发现自己处在一个非常不真实、像梦一般的情境里。当他们毫不讶异地接受这种情境时，观众就不得不讶异这些角色为何不感到讶异。这是卓别林在他的默片中惯用的手法。这些默片中的喜剧效果经常来自于卓别林默默地接受所有发生在他身上的荒谬事情。这使得观众不得不检讨自己，追求更真实的事物。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's certainly surprising to see what people put up with without protesting."</p><p>“看到人们对于各种荒谬事件那种逆来顺受的态度，实在是让人觉得很惊讶。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"At times it can be right to feel: This is something I must get away from--even though I don't have any idea where to go."</p><p>“有时我们会有‘我必须远离这样的事，虽然我不知道该到哪里去’的感受。这种感觉可能并没有什么不好。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"If the house catches fire you just have to get out, even if you don't have any other place to live."</p><p>“如果房子着火了，你只好冲出去，虽然你没有其他地方可以住。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's true. Would you like another cup of tea? Or a Coke maybe?"</p><p>“没错。你想不想再喝一杯茶或一瓶可乐？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Okay. But I still think you were silly to be late."</p><p>“好。不过我还是认为你是个烂人，因为你迟到了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can live with that."</p><p>“没关系。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto came back with a cup of espresso and a Coke. Meanwhile Sophie had begun to like the cafe ambience. She was also beginning to think that the conversations at the other tables might not be as trivial as she had supposed them to be.</p><p>艾伯特回来时拿了一杯意大利浓咖啡和一瓶可乐。这时，苏菲已经开始喜欢上咖啡厅的气氛了。她也开始认为其他桌客人的谈话也许不像她想象的那样没有意义。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto banged the Coke bottle down on the table with a thud. Several people at the other tables looked up.</p><p>艾伯特“砰!”一声把可乐瓶子往桌上放。有几个别桌的客人抬起头来看。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And that brings us to the end of the road," he said.</p><p>“我们就上到这里了。”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You mean the history of philosophy stops with Sartre and existentialism?"</p><p>“你是说哲学史到了萨特和存在主义就结束了？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, that would be an exaggeration. Existentialist philosophy has had radical significance for many people all over the world. As we saw, its roots reach far back in history through Kierkegaard and way back to Socrates. The twentieth century has also witnessed a blossoming and a renewal of the other philosophical currents we have discussed."</p><p>“不，这样讲就太夸张了。存在主义哲学后来对世界各地的许多人产生了重大的影响。正如我们说过的，它的根可以回溯到祁克果，甚至远及苏格拉底。因此二十世纪也是一个我们谈过的其他哲学潮流开花结果、重新复苏的年代。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Like what?"</p><p>“比如说什么潮流？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, one such current is Neo-Thomism, that is to say ideas which belong to the tradition of Thomas Aquinas. Another is the so-called analytical philosophy or logical empiricism, with roots reaching back to Hume and British empiricism, and even to the logic of Aristotle. Apart from these, the twentieth century has naturally also been influenced by what we might call Neo-Marxism in a myriad of various trends. We have already talked about Neo-Darwinism and the significance of psychoanalysis."</p><p>“其中有一个是所谓的新圣多玛斯主义(Neo—Thomism)，也就是指那些属于圣多玛斯派的思想。另外一个就是所谓的‘分析哲学’或‘逻辑实验主义’。它的根源可追溯至休姆和英国的经验主义，甚至远及亚理斯多德的理则学。除此之外，二十世纪自然也曾受到所谓的新马克思主义的影响。至于新达尔文主义和精神分析的影响，我们已经谈过了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes."</p><p>“是的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We should just mention a final current, materialism, which also has historical roots. A lot of current science can be traced back to the efforts of the pre-Socratics. For example, the search for the indivisible 'elemental particle' of which all matter is composed. No one has yet been able to give a satisfactory explanation of what 'matter' is. Modern sciences such as nuclear physics and biochemistry are so fascinated by the problem that for many people it constitutes a vital part of their life's philosophy."</p><p>“最后还有一个是唯物主义。它同样有它历史上的根源。现代科学有一大部分源自苏格拉底之前的哲学家的努力，例如找寻组成所有物质的不可见的‘基础分子’。到目前为止还没有人能够对‘物质’是什么问题提出一个令人满意的答案。核子物理学与生物化学等现代科学对于这个问题极感兴趣，对许多人而言，这甚至是他们的生命哲学中很重要的一部分。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The new and the old all jumbled together . . ."</p><p>“新旧学说杂陈并列……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes. Because the very questions we started our course with are still unanswered. Sartre made an important observation when he said that existential questions cannot be answered once and for all. A philosophical question is by definition something that each generation, each individual even, must ask over and over again."</p><p>“对，因为我们开始这门课程时所提出的问题到现在还没有人能回答。在这方面，萨特说了一句很重要的话。他说：关于存在的问题是无法一次就回答清楚的。所谓哲学问题的定义就是每一个世代，甚至每一个人，都必须要一再的问自己的一些问题。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "A bleak thought."</p><p>“满悲观的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not sure I agree. Surely it is by asking such questions that we know we are alive. And moreover, it has always been the case that while people were seeking answers to the ultimate questions, they have discovered clear and final solutions to many other problems. Science, research, and technology are all by-products of our philosophical reflection. Was it not our wonder about life that finally brought men to the moon?"</p><p>“我并不一定同意你的说法。因为，借着提出这些问题，我们才知道自己活着。当人们追寻这些根本问题的答案时，他们总是会发现许多其他问题因此而有了清楚明确的解决方法。科学、研究和科技都是我们哲学思考的副产品。我们最后之所以能登陆月球难道不是因为我们对于生命的好奇吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, that's true."</p><p>“这倒是真的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"When Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon, he said 'One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' With these words he summed up how it felt to be the first man to set foot on the moon, drawing with him all the people who had lived before him. It was not his merit alone, obviously.</p><p>“当阿姆斯壮踏上月球时，他说：‘这是个人的一小步，人类的一大步。’他用这些话来总结他身为第一位登陆月球者的感想，话中提到了所有我们的祖先，因为这显然不是他一个人的功劳。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In our own time we also have completely new problems to face. The most serious are those of the environment. A central philosophical direction in the twentieth century is therefore ecophilosophy or ecosophy, as one of its founders the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess has called if. Many ecophilosophers in the western world have warned that western civilization as a whole is on a fundamentally wrong track, racing toward a head-on collision with the limits of what our planet can tolerate. They have tried to take soundings that go deeper than the concrete effects of pollution and environmental destruction. There is something basically wrong with western thought, they claim."</p><p>“在我们这个时代，我们有一些崭新的问题要去面对。其中最严重的就是环境问题。因此，二十世纪一个主要的哲学潮流就是‘生态哲学’(ecophilosophy)，这是挪威哲学家那斯(Arne Naess)所给的名称，他也是这种哲学的奠立者之一。许多西方的生态哲学家已经提出警告，整个西方文明的走向根本就是错误的，长此下去，势必将会超出地球所能承受的范围。他们谈的不只是环境污染与破坏这些具体的问题。他们宣称，西方的思想形态根本上就有一些谬误。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think they are right."</p><p>“我认为他们说得对。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"For example, ecophilosophy has questioned the very idea of evolution in its assumption that man is 'at the top'--as if we are masters of nature. This way of thinking could prove to be fatal for the whole living planet."</p><p>“举例来说，生态哲学家对于进化观念中以人为‘万物之首’的这个假设提出质疑。他们认为，人类这种自以为是大自然主宰的想法可能会对整个地球造成致命的伤害。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It makes me mad when I think about it."</p><p>“我每次一想到这个就很生气。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In criticizing this assumption, many ecophilosophers have looked to the thinking and ideas in other cultures such as those of India. They have also studied the thoughts and customs of so-called primitive peoples--or 'native-peoples' such as the Native Americans--in order to rediscover what we have lost.</p><p>“在批评这个假设时，许多生态哲学家注意到印度等其他文化的观念与思想。他们并且研究了所谓‘原始民族’或美洲印第安人和爱斯基摩人(现已改称因纽特人——编者注)等‘原住民’的想法与习俗，以重新探索我们所失落的东西。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In scientific circles in recent years it has been said that our whole mode of scientific thought is facing a 'paradigm shift.' That is to say, a fundamental shift in the way scientists think. This has already borne fruit in several fields. We have witnessed numerous examples of so-called 'alternative movements' advocating holism and a new lifestyle."</p><p>“近年来科学界有二种说法是：我们整个科学思想的模式正面临一个‘典范移转’(paradigm shift)，意思就是说科学家思考的方式有了一个根本上的转变，而且这个现象已经在若干领域内开花结果。我们可以看到许多所谓‘新生活运动’(alternative movements)倡导整体主义(holism)和新的生活方式。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Great."</p><p>“太好了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"However, when there are many people involved, one must always distinguish between good and bad. Some proclaim that we are entering a new age. But everything new is not necessarily good, and not all the old should be thrown out. That is one of the reasons why I have given you this course in philosophy. Now you have the historical background, you can orient yourself in life."</p><p>“不过，当一件事情牵涉到许多人时，我们必须要学会分辨好坏优劣。有些人宣称我们正进入一个‘新时代’，但并不是每一件新的东西都是好的。我们也不能把所有旧东西都抛弃。这是我为什么让你上这门哲学课的原因之一。你现在已经知道了古往今来的哲学理念了。接下来你应该能够为自己的人生找到一个方向。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you."</p><p>“非常谢谢你。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think you will find that much of what marches under the New Age banner is humbug. Even the so-called New Religion, New Occultism, and modern superstitions of all kinds have influenced the western world in recent decades. It has become an industry. Alternative offers on the philosophical market have mushroomed in the wake of the dwindling support for Christianity."</p><p>“我想你会发现那些打着‘新时代’旗号的运动有一大部分都是骗人的玩意。这几十年来西方世界甚至受到所谓的‘新宗教’、‘新神秘主义’和各式各样现代迷信的影响。这些东西已经变成一种企业了。由于信奉基督教的人日益减少，哲学市场上就出现了许许多多的替代产品。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What sort of offers?"</p><p>“什么样的替代产品？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The list is so long I wouldn't dare to begin. And anyway it's not easy to describe one's own age. But why don't we take a stroll through town? There's something I'd like you to see."</p><p>“多得不胜枚举。无论如何，要描述我们本身所在的这个时代并不容易。现在我们可不可以到镇上去散散步？我想让你看一个东西。”苏菲耸耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I haven't got much time. I hope you haven't forgotten the garden party tomorrow?"</p><p>“我没有多少时间了。你没有忘记明天的花园宴会吧？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course not. That's when something wonderful is going to happen. We just have to round off Hilde's philosophy course first. The major hasn't thought beyond that, you see. So he loses some of his mastery over us."</p><p>“当然没有。那个时候会发生一件很奇妙的事。不过我们先得让席德的哲学课程有一个圆满的结束。少校还没有想到那儿，你明白吗？因此他已经不再能够完全控制我们了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Once again he lifted the Coke bottle, which was now empty, and banged it down on the table.</p><p>他再次举起现在已经空了的可乐瓶，往桌上“砰!”一声用力一敲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They walked out into the street where people were hurrying by like energetic moles in a molehill. Sophie wondered what Alberto wanted to show her.</p><p>他们走到街上，人们正像蚂蚁窝里精力充沛的蚂蚁一样熙来攘往。苏菲心想艾伯特不知道要让她看什么东西。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>Alberto pointed to the window display and said:"There you have the twentieth century, Sophie. In the Renaissance the world began to explode, so to speak. Beginning with the great voyages of discovery, Europeans started to travel all over the world. Today it's the opposite. We could call it an explosion in reverse."</p><p>艾伯特指着橱窗里的东西说：“这就是二十世纪了。在文艺复兴时代，世界开始膨胀。自从那些伟大的探险航程展开后，欧洲人就开始走遍世界各地。今天情形正好相反。我们称之为反膨胀。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In what sense?"</p><p>“怎么说呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"In the sense that the world is becoming drawn together into one great communications network. Not so long ago philosophers had to travel for days by horse and carriage in order to investigate the world around them and meet other philosophers. Today we can sit anywhere at all on this planet and access the whole of human experience on a computer screen."</p><p>“意思是说世界正逐渐凝聚成一个庞大的通讯网络。在不算很久以前，哲学家们还必须坐好几天的马车才能到其他的地方去探索这个世界，并会见其他的哲学家。今天我们不论在地球任何一个角落都可以透过电脑荧屏获得人类所有的经验。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's a fantastic thought. And a little scary."</p><p>“想起来真是棒极了，甚至让人有点怕怕的，真的。” </p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>"This is also the twentieth century, Sophie. This is the temple of our age."</p><p>“这也是二十世纪的现象。这是我们这个时代的神庙。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You don't believe in any of this stuff?"</p><p>“这些东西你都不相信吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Much of it is humbug. But it sells as well as pornography. A lot of it is a kind of pornography. Young people can come here and purchase the ideas that fascinate them most. But the difference between real philosophy and these books is more or less the same as the difference between real love and pornography."</p><p>“其中有一大部分是鬼话。但他们的销路和色情刊物一样好，事实上它们有许多可以算得上是一种色情刊物。年轻人可以来到这儿，购买他们认为最有趣的思想。但这些书和真正的哲学之间的差异就像色情和真爱之间的差异一样。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Aren't you being rather crass?"</p><p>“你这样说不是太粗鲁了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Let's go and sit in the park."</p><p>“我们到公园里去坐吧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They marched out of the store and found a vacant bench in front of the church. Pigeons were strutting around under the trees, the odd overeager sparrow hopping about amongst them.</p><p>他们走出书店，在教堂前找了一张没有人坐的长椅。旁边树底下成群的鸽子正摇头摆尾地走来走去，一只孤零零的麻雀在他们中间过度热心地跳来跳去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's called ESP or parapsychology," said Alberto. "Or it's called telepathy, clairvoyance, and psychokinetics. It's called spiritism, astrology, and urology."</p><p>“那些东西叫做ESP或灵学超心理学，”他开始说。“或者也叫做精神感应术、超感应能力、灵视和心理动力学，有些也叫做招魂术、占星术和幽浮学。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But quite honestly, do you really think it's all hum-bug?"</p><p>“老实说，你真的认为它们都是骗人的玩意吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Obviously it would not be very appropriate for a real philosopher to say they are all equally bad. But I don't mind saying that all these subjects together possibly chart a fairly detailed map of a landscape that does not exist. And there are many 'figments of the imagination' here that Hume would have committed to the flames. Many of those books do not contain so much as one iota of genuine experience."</p><p>“当然一个真正的哲学家不应该说它们都不好。但我可以说所有这些学问加起来就像一张地图一样，虽然巨细靡遗，但问题是那块土地可能根本并不存在，而且其中有许多是‘想象的虚构物’。要是休姆的话，早就一把火把它们给烧了。那些书里面，有许多根本没有包含一丝一毫的真实经验。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "Why are there such incredible numbers of books on such subjects?"</p><p>“那为什么会出现这么多这类的书呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Publishing such books is a big commercial enterprise. It's what most people want."</p><p>“这是全世界最大规模的营利企业，因为那就是大多数人想要的东西。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why, do you think?"</p><p>“那你认为他们为什么想要这些呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They obviously desire something mystical, something different to break the dreary monotony of everyday life. But it is like carrying coals to Newcastle."</p><p>“他们显然是希望有一些‘神秘的’、‘不一样’的东西来打破日常生活的烦闷与单调。可是这简直是多此一举！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How do you mean?"</p><p>“怎么说呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Here we are, wandering around in a wonderful adventure. A work of creation is emerging in front of our very eyes. In broad daylight, Sophie! Isn't it marvelous!"</p><p>“囚为我们已经置身在一场奇妙的探险旅程里。青天白日之下，在我们的眼前就有一件伟大的创作品。这不是很美妙吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I guess so."</p><p>“我想是吧。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why should we enter the fortune-teller's tent or the backyards of academe in search of something exciting or transcendental?"</p><p>“我们为什么还要跑到占卜术士的帐篷或从学院派的后门去找寻一些‘刺激’或‘超自然’东西呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you saying that the people who write these books are just phonies and liars?"</p><p>“你是说写这类书的人都是些江湖术士或骗子吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, that's not what I'm saying. But here, too, we are talking about a Darwinian system."</p><p>“不，我并没有这样说。可是这当中也有一个达尔文系统。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You'll have to explain that."</p><p>“请你解释一下好吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Think of all the different things that can happen in a single day. You can even take a day in your own life. Think of all the things you see and experience."</p><p>“请你想想看一天里面能够发生多少事。你甚至可以挑选你生命中的一天，然后想一想那天里你所看到和经验到的一切事物。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes?"</p><p>“然后呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Now and then you experience a strange coincidence. You might go into a store and buy something for 28 crowns. Later on that day Joanna comes along and gives you the 28 crowns she owes you. You both decide to go to the movies--and you get seat number 28."</p><p>“有时你会碰到一些奇异的巧合。你可能会跑进一家店里，买了一个价值二十八块钱的东西。后来，在同一天，乔安又跑来还她欠你的二十八块钱。然后你们两个决定要去看电影，结果你的座位号码是二十八号。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, that would be a mysterious coincidence."</p><p>“嗯，这的确是一个很神秘的巧合。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It would be a coincidence, anyway. The point is, people collect coincidences like these. They collect strange-- or inexplicable--experiences When such experiences-- taken from the lives of billions of people--are assembled into books, it begins to look like genuine data. And the amount of it increases all the time. But once again we are looking at a lottery in which only the winning numbers are visible."</p><p>“不管怎样，这些事就是一种巧合。问题在于有些人就会搜集这类巧合，还有各种奇异的、无法解释的经验。当这类取自数十亿人生活中的经验被集结成书时，看起来就像是真实的数据。而它们的数量会愈来愈庞大。不过这也像是一场摸彩，只有中奖的号码才会被公布出来。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But there are clairvoyants and mediums, aren't there, who are constantly experiencing things like that?"</p><p>“可是世上确实有天眼通和灵媒这些人，不是吗？他们不断地有这类经验呀。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "Indeed there are, and if we exclude the phonies, we find another explanation for these so-called mysterious experiences."</p><p>“确实是有。但撇开那些招摇撞骗的人不谈，我们仍然可以为这些所谓的神秘经验找到另外一种解释。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And that is?"</p><p>“什么解释？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You remember we talked about Freud's theory of the unconscious . . ."</p><p>“你还记得我们谈过佛洛伊德所说的潜意识理论吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course."</p><p>“当然记得啦。我不是一再告诉你我的记性很好吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Freud showed that we can often serve as 'mediums' for our own unconscious. We might suddenly find ourselves thinking or doing something without really knowing why. The reason is that we have a whole lot of experiences, thoughts, and memories inside us that we are not aware of."</p><p>“佛洛伊德曾说我们可能时常是自己潜意识的‘灵媒’。我们可能会突然发现自己正在想着或做着某件事，连自己也不太明白原因。这是因为我们内心中有许多连自己也没有察觉的经验、想法或记忆。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So?"</p><p>“所以说呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"People sometimes talk or walk in their sleep. We could call this a sort of 'mental automatism.' Also under hypnosis, people can say and do things 'not of their own volition.' And remember the surrealists trying to produce so-called automatic writing. They were just trying to serve as mediums for their own unconscious."</p><p>“你知道有些人会梦游或说梦话，我们可以称之为一种‘精神上的无意识行动’。除此之外，人们在经过催眠之后，也可能会‘不由自主’地说一些话或做一些事。你也许还记得那些超现实主义者曾经试图要制造所谓的自动写作。事实上他们只是试图要做自己潜意识的灵媒罢了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I remember."</p><p>“嗯，这个我也记得。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"From time to time during this century there have been what are called 'spiritualist revivals,' the idea being that a medium could get into contact with a deceased person. Either by speaking in the voice of the deceased, or by using automatic writing, the medium would receive a message from someone who had lived five or fifty or many hundreds of years ago. This has been taken as evidence either that there is life after death or that we live many lives."</p><p>“本世纪不时流行我们所称的‘通灵’现象。有些人相信灵媒可以和已逝者接触。这些灵媒或者用死者的声音来说话，或者透过自动写作，借此接收几百年前某个古人的信息。有人认为这种现象证明人死后会进入另外一个世界，或者世间确实有轮回。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, I know."</p><p>“嗯，我知道。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm not saying that all mediums have been fakes. Some have clearly been in good faith. They really have been mediums, but they have only been mediums for their own unconscious. There have been several cases of mediums being closely studied while in a trance, and revealing knowledge and abilities that neither they nor others understand how they can have acquired. In one case, a woman who had no knowledge of Hebrew passed on messages in that language. So she must have either lived before or been in contact with a deceased spirit."</p><p>“我的意思并不是说所有的灵媒都是江湖术士。他们有些确实不是骗人的。他们确实当过灵媒，但他们所当的只是自己潜意识的灵媒罢了。曾经有过好几个这样的例子：有人仔细观察一些灵媒在恍惚状态的反应，发现他们居然会显示出一些无论是他们自己或别人都不知道他们如何获得的知识或能力。在其中一个案例里，一个从来没有学过希伯来文的女人突然以希伯来文说出一些事情。因此她必定是在前世学的，要不就是她曾经和某个死者的灵魂沟通。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Which do you think?"</p><p>“你相信哪一种说法呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It turned out that she had had a Jewish nanny when she was little."</p><p>“结果后来发现她小时候有一个奶妈是犹太人。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah."</p><p>“啊！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does that disappoint you? It just shows what an incredible capacity some people have to store experience in their unconscious."</p><p>“你很失望吗？这个现象显示有些人具有不可思议的能力，可以把从前的经验储存在他们的潜意识里。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I see what you mean."</p><p>“我懂你的意思了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A lot of curious everyday happenings can be explained by Freud's theory of the unconscious. I might suddenly get a call from a friend I haven't heard from for many years just as I had begun to look for his telephone number "</p><p>“有许多日常生活中不可思议的事件都可以用佛洛伊德的潜意识理论来解释。也许有一天我正要找一个多年没有联络的朋友的电话时，却刚好接到他打来的电话。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It gives me goose bumps."</p><p>“满诡异的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But the explanation could be that we both heard the same old song on the radio, a song we heard the last time we were together. The point is, we are not aware of the underlying connection."</p><p>“可是事实上也许是我们两个同时听到收音机里播的一首老歌，而这首歌刚好是我们两个上一次见面时听到的。重要的是，我们都没有察觉到其中的关联。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So it's either humbug, or the winning number effect, or else it's the unconscious. Right?"</p><p>“所以这些事情要不就是道听途说，要不就是因为特别奇怪才众口相传，要不就是潜意识的作用，对吗？”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, in any case, it's healthier to approach such books with a decent portion of skepticism. Not least if one is a philosopher. There is an association in England for skeptics. Many years ago they offered a large reward to the first person who could provide even the slightest proof of something supernatural. It didn't need to be a great miracle, a tiny example of telepathy would do. So far, nobody has come forward "</p><p>“不管怎样，在进到这类书店时抱持相当的怀疑态度总是比较健康的，特别是对一个哲学家而言。英国有一个由怀疑论者组成的协会。许多年前他们重金悬赏第一个能够对那些超自然现象提供一点点证明的人。他们并不要求参加者展示什么奇迹，而只要他们表演一点点心电感应就可以了。但是到目前为止，没有一个人来参加。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hmm."</p><p>“嗯。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"On the other hand, there is a lot we humans don't understand. Maybe we don't understand the laws of nature either. During the last century there were a lot of peo-ple who thought that phenomena such as magnetism and electricity were a kind of magic. I'll bet my own great-grandmother would have been wide-eyed with amaze-ment if I told her about TV or computers."</p><p>“话说回来，有很多现象仍然是我们人类无法理解的。也许我们还不是真正了解自然的法则。在上一个世纪，许多人认为磁力与电力的现象是一种魔术。我敢打赌我的曾祖母如果听到我说关于电视和电脑的事，一定会惊讶得目瞪口呆。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"So you don't believe in anything supernatural then."</p><p>“这么说你并不相信所有超自然的现象吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We've already talked about that. Even the term 'supernatural' is a curious one. No, I suppose I believe that there is only one nature. But that, on the other hand, is absolutely astonishing."</p><p>“我们已经谈过这点了。就连‘超自然’这个名词听起来也很奇怪。不，我相信世上只有一个自然。但从另外一方面来说，这也是很令人惊异的事。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But the sort of mysterious things in those books you just showed me?"</p><p>“可是你让我看的那些书里面记载了那么多神秘的事情……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"All true philosophers should keep their eyes open. Even if we have never seen a white crow, we should never stop looking for it. And one day, even a skeptic like me could be obliged to accept a phenomenon I did not believe in before. If I did not keep this possibility open I would be dogmatic, and not a true philosopher."</p><p>“所有真正的哲学家都应该睁大眼睛。即使我们从来没有见过白色的乌鸦，我们也不应该放弃寻找它。也许有一天，连我这样的怀疑论者也会不得不接受某种我从前并不相信的现象。如果我不承认有这种可能性，那我就是一个武断的人，而不是一个真正的哲学家。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto and Sophie remained seated on the bench without saying anything. The pigeons craned their necks and cooed, now and then being startled by a bicycle or a sudden movement.</p><p>艾伯特和苏菲继续坐在长椅上，两人都没有说话。那些鸽子伸长了脖子咕咕的叫着，不时被一辆路过的脚踏车或突然的动作吓着。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have to go home and prepare for the party," said Sophie at last.</p><p>“我必须回家打点宴会的事了。”最后苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But before we part, I'll show you a white crow. It is nearer than we think, you see."</p><p>“可是在我们分手以前，我要给你看一只白色的乌鸦。它比我们所想象的更接近我们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto got up and led the way back into the bookstore. This time they walked past all the books on supernatural phenomena and stopped by a flimsy shelf at the very back of the store. Above the shelf hung a very small card. PHILOSOPHY, it read.</p><p>他从长椅上站起来，示意苏菲再回到书店里去。这次他们走过所有关于超自然现象的书，停在书店最里面一个看起来不甚牢固的架子前。架子的上方挂着一块很小的牌子，上面写着：哲学类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto pointed down at a particular book, and Sophie gasped as she read the title: Sophie's World.</p><p>艾伯特指着架上的一本书。苏菲看到书名时不禁吓了一跳。上面写着：苏菲的世界。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Would you like me to buy it for you?"</p><p>“你要不要我买一本送给你？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't know if I dare."</p><p>“我不太敢看耶！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Shortly afterward, however, she was on her way home with the book in one hand and a little bag of things for the garden party in the other.</p><p>无论如何，过了没多久，她就走在回家的路上了，一手拿着那本书，另一手则拿着一个小袋子，里面装着她刚才买的花园宴会用品。</p></div>
