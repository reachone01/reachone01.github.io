<div class='layout'><p>34 Counterpoint</p><p>34 对位法</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>……two or more melodies sounding together……</p><p> ……两首或多首旋律齐响…… </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde sat up in bed. That was the end of the story of Sophie and Alberto. But what had actually happened?</p><p>席德在床上坐起来。苏菲和艾伯特的故事就这样结束了，但到底发生了什么事？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Why had her father written that last chapter? Was it just to demonstrate his power over Sophie's world?Deep in thought, she took a shower and got dressed. She ate a quick breakfast and then wandered down the garden and sat in the glider.</p><p>爸爸为何要写那最后一章呢？难道只是为了展示他对苏菲的世界的影响力吗？她满腹心事地洗了一个澡，穿好衣服，很快地用过早餐，然后就漫步到花园里，坐在秋千上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She agreed with Alberto that the only sensible thing that had happened at the garden party was his speech. Surely her father didn't think Hilde's world was as chaotic as Sophie's garden party? Or that her world would also dissolve eventually?</p><p>她同意艾伯特的说法。花园宴会里唯一有道理的东西就是他的演讲。爸爸该不会认为席德的世界就像苏菲的花园宴会一样乱七八糟吧？还是他认为她的世界最后也会消失呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then there was the matter of Sophie and Alberto. What had happened to the secret plan?</p><p>还有苏菲和艾伯特。他们的秘密计划最后怎么了？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Was it up to Hilde herself to continue the story? Or had they really managed to sneak out of it?</p><p>他是不是要席德自己把这个故事继续下去？还是他们真的溜到故事外面去了？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And where were they now?</p><p>他们现在到底在哪里呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A thought suddenly struck her. If Alberto and Sophie really had managed to sneak out of the story, there wouldn't be anything about it in the ring binder. Everything that was there, unfortunately, was clear to her father.</p><p>她突然有一种想法。如果艾伯特和苏菲真的溜到故事外面去了，讲义夹里的书页上就不会再提到他们了。因为很不幸的，书里所有的内容爸爸都很清楚呀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Could there be anything written between the lines? There was more than a mere suggestion of it. Hilde realized that she would have to read the whole story again one or two more times.</p><p>可不可能在字里行间有别的意思？书里很明显地暗示有这种可能性。坐在秋千上，她领悟到她必须把整个故事至少重新再看一遍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As the white Mercedes drove into the garden, Alberto dragged Sophie with him into the den. Then they ran into the woods in the direction of the major's cabin.</p><p>当白色的宾士轿车开进花园里时，艾伯特把苏菲拉进密洞中。然后他们便跑进树林，朝少校的小木屋方向跑去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quickly!" cried Alberto. "It's got to happen before he starts looking for us."</p><p>“快！”艾伯特喊。“我们要在他开始找我们之前完成。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are we beyond the major's reach now?"</p><p>“我们现在已经躲开他了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We are in the borderland."</p><p>“我们正在边缘。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They rowed across the water and ran into the cabin. Alberto opened a trapdoor in the floor. He pushed Sophie down into the cellar. Then everything went black.</p><p>他们划过湖面，冲进小木屋。艾伯特打开地板上的活门，把苏菲推进地窖里。然后一切都变黑了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the days that followed, Hilde worked on her plan. She sent several letters to Anne Kvamsdal in Copenhagen, and a couple of times she called her. She also enlisted the aid of friends and acquaintances, and recruited almost half of her class at school.</p><p>计划过完生日后几天里，席德进行着她的计划。她写了好几封信给哥本哈根的安妮，并打了两三通电话给她。她同时也请朋友和认识的人帮忙，结果她班上几乎半数的同学都答应助她一臂之力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In between, she read Sophie's World. It was not a story one could be done with after a single reading. New thoughts about what could have happened to Sophie and Alberto when they left the garden party were constantly occurring to her.</p><p>在这期间她也抽时间重读《苏菲的世界》。这不是一个读一次就可以的故事。在重读时，她脑海中对于苏菲和艾伯特在离开花园宴会后的遭遇，不断有了新的想法。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On Saturday, June 23, she awoke with a start around nine o'clock. She knew her father had already left the camp in Lebanon. Now it was just a question of waiting. The last part of his day was planned down to the smallest detail.</p><p>六月二十三日星期六那一天大约九点时，她突然从睡眠中惊醒。她知道这时爸爸已经离开黎巴嫩的营区。现在她只要静心等待就可以了。她已经把他这天最后的行程都详详细细计划妥当。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Later in the morning she began the preparations for Midsummer Eve with her mother. Hilde could not help thinking of how Sophie and her mother had arranged their Midsummer Eve party. But that was something they had done. It was over, finished. Or was it? Were they going around right now, decorating everywhere?</p><p>那天上午，她开始与妈妈一起准备仲夏节的事。席德不时想起苏菲和她妈妈安排仲夏节宴会的情景。不过这些事都已经发生了，已经完了，结束了。可是到底有没有呢？他们现在是不是也到处走来走去，忙着布置呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie and Alberto seated themselves on a lawn in front of two large buildings with ugly air vents and ventilation canals on the outside. A young couple came walking out of one of the buildings. He was carrying a brown briefcase and she had a red handbag slung over one shoulder. A car drove along a narrow road in the background.</p><p>苏菲和艾伯特坐在两栋大房子前的草坪上。房子外面可以看到几个难看的排气口和通风管。一对年轻的男女从其中一栋房屋里走出来。男的拿着一个棕色的手提箱，女的则在肩上背了一个红色的皮包。一辆轿车沿着后院的一条窄路向前开。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What happened?" asked Sophie.</p><p>“怎么了？”苏菲问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We made it!"</p><p>“我们成功了!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "But where are we?"</p><p>“可是我们现在在哪里呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This is Oslo."</p><p>“在奥斯陆。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are you quite sure?"</p><p>“你确定吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Quite sure. One of these buildings is called Chateau Neuf, which means 'the new palace.' People study music there. The other is the Congregation Faculty. It's a school of theology. Further up the hill they study science and up at the top they study literature and philosophy."</p><p>“确定。这里的房子有一栋叫做‘新宫’，是人们研习音乐的地方。另外一栋叫做‘会众学院’，是一所神学院。他们在更上坡一点的地方研究科学，并在山顶上研究文学与哲学。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Are we out of Hilde's book and beyond the major's control?"</p><p>“我们已经离开席德的书，不受少校的控制了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, both. He'll never find us here."</p><p>“是的。他绝不会知道我们在这里。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But where were we when we ran through the woods?"</p><p>“可是当我们跑过树林时，我们人在哪里呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"While the major was busy crashing the financial adviser's car into an apple tree, we seized the chance to hide in the den. We were then at the embryo stage. We were of the old as well as of the new world. But concealing ourselves there was something the major cannot possibly have envisaged."</p><p>“当少校忙着让乔安的爸爸的车撞到苹果树时，我们就逮住机会躲在密洞里。那时我们正处于胚胎的阶段。我们既是旧世界的人，也是新世界的人。可是少校绝对不可能想到我们会躲在那里。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why not?"</p><p>“为什么呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"He would never have let us go so easily. As it was, it went like a dream. Of course, there's always the chance that he was in on it himself."</p><p>“他绝不会这么轻易就放我们走，那就像一场梦一样，当然他自己也有可能参与其中。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>“怎么说呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was he who started the white Mercedes. He may have exerted himself to the utmost to lose sight of us. He was probably utterly exhausted after everything that had been going on . . ."</p><p>“是他发动那辆白色的宾士车的。他可能尽量不要看见我们。在发生这么多事情以后，他可能已经累惨了……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By now the young couple were only a few yards away. Sophie felt a bit awkward, sitting on the grass with a man so much older than herself. Besides, she wanted someone to confirm what Alberto had said.</p><p>此时，那对年轻的男女距他们只有几码路了。苏菲觉得自己这样和一个年纪比她大很多的男人坐在草地上真是有点窘。何况她需要有人来证实艾伯特说的话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She got up and went over to them. </p><p>于是，她站起来，走向他们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Excuse me, would you mind telling me the name of this street?</p><p>“打搅一下，你可不可以告诉我这条街叫什么名字？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But they ignored her completely.</p><p>可是他们既不回答她，也没有注意到她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie was so provoked that she asked them again.</p><p>她很生气，又大声问了一次。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's customary to answer a person, isn't it?"</p><p>“人家问你，你总不能不回答吧？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The young man was clearly engrossed in explaining something to his companion:</p><p>那位年轻的男子显然正在专心向他的同伴解释一件事情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Contrapuntal form operates on two dimensions, horizontally, or melodically, and vertically, or harmonically.There will always be two or more melodies sounding together . . ."</p><p>“对位法的形式是在两个空间中进行的。水平的和垂直的，前者是指旋律，后者是指和声。总是有两种以上的旋律一齐响起……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Excuse me for interrupting, but. . ."</p><p>“抱歉打搅你们，可是……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The melodies combine in such a way that they develop as much as possible, independently of how they sound against each other. But they have to be concordant. Actually it's note against note."</p><p>“这些旋律结合在一起，尽情发展，不管它们合起来效果如何。可是它们必须和谐一致。事实上那是一个音符对一个音符。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How rude! They were neither deaf nor blind. Sophie tried a third time, standing ahead of them on the path blocking their way,She was simply brushed aside.</p><p>多么没礼貌呀！他们既不是瞎子，也不是聋子。苏菲又试了一次。她站在他们前面，挡住他们的去路。他们却擦身而过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There's a wind coming up," said the woman.</p><p>“起风了。”女人说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie rushed back to Alberto.</p><p>苏菲连忙跑回艾伯特所在的地方。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>'They can't hear me!" she said desperately--and just as she said it, she recalled her dream about Hilde and the gold crucifix.</p><p>“他们听不见我说话!”她绝望地说。这时她突然想起她梦见席德和金十字架的事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's the price we have to pay. Although we have sneaked out of a book, we can't expect to nave exactly the same status as its author. But we really are here. From now on, we will never be a day older than we were when we left the philosophical garden party."</p><p>“这是我们必须付出的代价。虽然我们溜出了一本书，可是我们却别想和作者拥有一样的身分。不过我们真的是在这里。从现在起，我们将永远不会老去。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does that mean we'll never have any real contact with me people around us?"</p><p>“这是不是说我们永远不会和我们周遭的人有真正的接触？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"A true philosopher never says 'never.' What time is it?"</p><p>“一个真正哲学家永不说‘永不’。现在几点了？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Eight o'clock."</p><p>“八点钟。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The same as when we left Captain's Bend, of course."</p><p>“喔，当然了，和我们离开船长湾的时间一样。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This is the day Hilde's father gets back from Lebanon."</p><p>“今天席德的父亲从黎巴嫩回来。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's why we must hurry."</p><p>“所以我们才要赶快。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why--what do you mean?"</p><p>“为什么呢？这话怎么说？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Aren't you anxious to know what happens when the major gets home to Bjerkely?"</p><p>“你不是很想知道少校回到柏客来山庄后会发生什么事吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Naturally, but. . ."</p><p>“当然啦，可是……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Come on, then!"</p><p>“那就来吧！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They began to walk down toward the city. Several people passed them on the way, but they all walked right on by as if Sophie and Alberto were invisible.</p><p>他们开始向城市走去。路上有几个人经过他们，可是他们都一直往前走，好像没看到苏菲和艾伯特似的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Cars were parked by the curbside all the way along the street. Alberto stopped by a small red convertible with the top down.</p><p>整条街道旁边都密密麻麻停满了车。艾伯特在一辆红色的小敞篷车前停了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "This will do," he said. "We must just make sure it's ours."</p><p>“这辆就可以，”他说。“我们只要确定它是我们的就好了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I have no idea what you mean."</p><p>“我一点都不知道你在说什么。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'd better explain then. We can't just take an ordinary car that belongs to someone here in the city. What do you think would happen when people noticed the car driving along without a driver? And anyway, we probably wouldn't be able to start it."</p><p>“那我还是向你解释一下好了。我们不能随随便便开一辆属于这城里某个人的车子。你想如果别人发现这辆车没有人开就自动前进，那会发生什么事呢？何况，我们还不见得能发动它。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then why the convertible?"</p><p>“那你为什么选这辆敞篷车呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I think I recognize it from an old movie."</p><p>“我想我在一部老片里看过它。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Look, I'm sorry, but I'm getting tired of all these cryptic remarks."</p><p>“听着，我很抱歉，但我可不想继续和你打哑谜了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's a make-believe car, Sophie. It's just like us. People here only see a vacant space. That's all we have to confirm before we're on our way."</p><p>“苏菲，这不是一部真的车。它就像我们一样，别人在这里看到的是一个空的停车位，我们只要证实这点就可以上路了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They stood by the car and waited. After a while, a boy came cycling along on the sidewalk. He turned suddenly and rode right through the red car and onto the road.</p><p>他们站在车子旁边等候。过了一会儿，有个男孩在人行道上骑了一辆脚踏车过来。他突然转个弯，一直骑过这辆红敞篷车，骑到路上去了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"There, you see? It's ours!"</p><p>“你看到没？这辆车是我们的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto opened the door to the passenger seat.</p><p>艾伯特把驾驶座另外一边的车门打开。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Be my guest!" he said, and Sophie got in.</p><p>“请进!”他说，于是苏菲就坐进去了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He got into the driver's seat. The key was in the ignition, he turned it, and the engine started.</p><p>他自己则进了驾驶座。车钥匙正插在点火器上。他一转动钥匙，引擎就发动了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They drove southward out of the city, past Lysaker, Sandvika, Drammen, and down toward Lillesand. As they drove they saw more and more Midsummer bonfires, especially after they had passed Drammen.</p><p>他们沿着城市的南方前进，很快就开到了卓曼(Dramman)公路上，并经过莱萨克(Lysaker)和桑德维卡(Sandvika)。他们一路看到愈来愈多的仲夏节火堆，尤其是在过了卓曼以后。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's Midsummer, Sophie. Isn't it wonderful?"</p><p>“已经是仲夏了，苏菲。这不是很美妙吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And there's such a lovely fresh breeze in an open car. Is it true that no one can see us?"</p><p>“而且这风好清新、好舒服呀!还好我们开的是敞篷车。艾伯特，真的没有人能够看见我们吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Only people of our own kind. We might meet some of them. What's the time now?"</p><p>“只有像我们这一类的人。我们可能会遇见其中几位。现在几点了？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Half past eight."</p><p>“八点半了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll have to take a few shortcuts. We can't stay behind this trailer, that's for sure."</p><p>“我们必须走几条捷径，不能老跟在这辆拖车后面。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They turned off into a large wheatfield. Sophie looked back and saw that they had left a broad trail of flattened stalks.</p><p>他们转个弯，开进了一块辽阔的玉米田。苏菲回头一看，发现车子开过的地方，玉米秆都被压平了，留下一条很宽的痕迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Tomorrow they'll say a freak wind blew over the field," said Alberto.</p><p>“明天他们就会说有一阵很奇怪的风吹过了这片玉米田。”艾伯特说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>操纵</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Major Albert Knag had just landed at Kastrup Airport outside Copenhagen. It was half past four on Saturday, June 23. It had already been a long day. This penultimate lap had been by plane from Rome.</p><p>艾勃特少校刚刚从罗马抵达卡斯楚普机场。时间是六月二十三日星期六下午四点半。对于他来说，这是个漫长的一天。卡斯楚普是他行程的倒数第二站。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He went through passport control in his UN uniform, which he was proud to wear. He represented not only himself and his country. Albert Knag represented an international legal system--a century-old tradition that now embraced the entire planet.</p><p>他穿着他一向引以为豪的联合国制服，走过护照检查站。他不仅代表他自己和他的国家，也代表一个国际司法体系，一个有百年传统、涵盖全球的机构。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He carried only a flight bag. He had checked the rest of his baggage through from Rome. He just needed to hold up his red passport.</p><p>他身上只背着一个飞行背包。其他的行李都在罗马托运了。他只需要举起他那红色的护照就行了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Nothing to declare."</p><p>“我没有什么东西要报关。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Major Albert Knag had a nearly three-hour wait in the airport before his plane left for Kristiansand. He would have time to buy a few presents for his family. He had sent the present of his life to Hilde two weeks ago. Marit, his wife, had put it on her bedside table for her to discover when she woke up on her birthday. He had not spoken with Hilde since that late night birthday call.</p><p>还有将近三个小时，开往基督山的班机才会起飞。因此，他有时间为家人买一些礼物。他已经在两个星期前把他用毕生心血做成的礼物寄给席德了。玛丽特把它放在席德床边的桌子上，好让她在生日那天一觉醒来就可以看到那份礼物。自从那天深夜他打电话向席德说生日快乐后，他就没有再和她说过话了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Albert bought a couple of Norwegian newspapers, found himself a table in the bar, and ordered a cup of coffee. He had hardly had time to skim the headlines when he heard an announcement over the loudspeakers: "This is a personal call for Albert Knag. Albert Knag is requested to contact the SAS information desk."</p><p>艾勃特买了两三份挪威报纸，在酒吧里找了一张桌子坐下，并叫了一杯咖啡。他还没来得及浏览一下标题，就听到扩音器在广播：“旅客艾勃特请注意，艾勃特，请和SAS服务台联络。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What now? He felt a chill down his spine. Surely he was not being ordered back to Lebanon? Could something be wrong at home?He quickly reached the SAS information desk.</p><p>怎么回事？他的背脊一阵发凉。他该不会又被调回黎巴嫩吧？是不是家里发生了什么事？他快步走到SAS服务台。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm Albert Knag."</p><p>“我就是艾勃特。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Here is a message for you. It is urgent."</p><p>“有一张紧急通知要给你。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He opened the envelope at once. Inside lay a smaller envelope. It was addressed to Major Albert Knag, c/o SAS Information, Kastrup Airport, Copenhagen.</p><p>他立刻打开信封。里面有一个较小的信封。上面写着；请哥本哈根卡斯楚普机场SAS服务台转交艾勃特少校。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Albert opened the little envelope nervously. It contained a short note:</p><p>艾勃特忐忑不安地拆开那个小信封。里面有一张短短的字条：</p></div>

<div class="lettle">
<div class='layout'>

<div class='layout'><p>Welcome home from Lebanon. As you can imagine, I can't even wait till you get home. Forgive me for having you paged over the loud-speakers. It was the easiest way.</p><p>欢迎你从黎巴嫩回来。你应该可以想到，我真是等不及你回来了。原谅我请人用扩音器呼叫你。因为这样最方便。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>P.S. Unfortunately a claim for damages has arrived from financial adviser Ingebrigtsen regarding a stolen and wrecked Mercedes.</p><p>PS：很不幸的，乔安的爸爸已经寄来通知，要求赔偿他那辆被窃后撞毁的宾士轿车。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>P.S. P.S. I may be sitting in the garden when you get here. But you might also be hearing from me before that.</p><p>PS．PS：当你回来时，我可能正坐在花园里。可是在那之前，我可能还会跟你联络。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>P.S. P.S. P.S. I'm rather scared of staying in the garden too long at a time. It's so easy to sink into the ground in such places. Love from Hilde, who has had plenty of time to prepare your homecoming.</p><p>PS．PS．PS：我不敢一次在花园里停留太久。在这种地方，人很容易陷到土里去。我还有很多时间准备欢迎你回家呢。爱你的席德。</p></div>
</div>
<div class='layout'><p>Major Albert Knag's first impulse was to smile. But he did not appreciate being manipulated in this manner. He had always liked to be in charge of his own life. Now this little vixen in Lillesand was directing his movements in Kastrup Airport! How had she managed that?</p><p>艾勃特少校的第一个冲动是想笑。可是他并不喜欢像这样被人操纵。他一向喜欢做自己生命的主宰。但现在这个小鬼却正在黎乐桑指挥他在卡斯楚普的一举一动!她是怎么办到的？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He put the envelope in his breast pocket and began to stroll toward the little shopping mall. He was just about to enter the Danish Food deli when he noticed a small envelope taped to the store window. It had MAJOR KNAG written on it with a thick marker pen. Albert took it down and opened it:</p><p>他把信封放在胸前的口袋里开始慢慢地向机场的小型购物商场走过去。他刚要进入一家丹麦食品店时，突然注意到店里的橱窗上贴了一个小信封。上面用很粗的马克笔写着：艾勃特少校。艾勃特把它从橱窗上拿下来，并打开它：</p></div>


<div class='layout'><p>Personal message for Major Albert Knag, c/o Danish Food, Kastrup Airport. </p><p>私人信函。请卡斯楚普机场的丹麦食品店转交艾勃特少校。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>please buy a large Danish salami, preferably a two-pound one, and Mom would probably like a cognac sausage. </p><p>请买一条很大的丹麦香肠，最好是有两磅重的。妈可能会想要一条法国白兰地香肠。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>P. S. Danish caviar is not bad either. Love, Hilde.</p><p>PS：丹麦鱼子酱也不赖。爱你的席德。</p></div>
</div>
<div class='layout'><p>Albert turned around. She wasn't here, was she? Had Mark given her a trip to Copenhagen so she could meet him here? It was Hilde's handwriting ...</p><p>艾勃特转一圈。她不会在这儿吧？玛丽特是不是让她飞到哥本哈根，好让她在这里跟他会合呢？这是席德的笔迹没错……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly the UN observer began to feel himself observed. It was as if someone was in remote control of everything he did. He felt like a doll in the hands of a child.</p><p>突然间这位联合国观察员觉得自己正在被人观察。仿佛有人正在遥控他所做的每一件事。他觉得自己像个被小孩子抓在手里的洋娃娃。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He went into the shop and bought a two-pound salami, a cognac sausage, and three jars of Danish caviar. Then he continued down the row of stores. He had made up his mind to buy a proper present for Hilde. A calculator, maybe? Or a little radio--yes, that was what he would get.</p><p>他进入食品店，买了一条两磅重的腊肠，一条白兰地香肠和三罐丹麦鱼子酱。然后便沿着这排商店逛过去。他已经决定也要给席德买一份恰当的礼物。是计算机好呢，还是一架小收音机？嗯，对了，就买收音机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he got to the store that sold electrical appliances, he saw that there was an envelope taped to the window there too. This one was addressed to "Major Albert Knag, c/o the most interesting store in Kastrup." Inside was the following note:</p><p>当他走到卖电器的商店时，他看到橱窗上也贴了一个信封。这回上面写着：请卡斯楚普机场最有趣的商店转交艾勃特少校。里面的字条上写着：</p></div>
<div class="lettle">
<div class='layout'>
<p style="text-indent:0em">Dear Dad, </p>
<p style="text-indent:0em">亲爱的爸爸：</p>
</div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie sends her greetings and thanks for the combined mini-TV and FM radio that she got for her birthday from her very generous father. It was great, but on the other hand it was a mere bagatelle. I must confess, though, that I share Sophie's liking for such bagatelles. </p><p>苏菲写信问候你，并且谢谢你，因为她那很慷慨的父亲送了她一个迷你电视兼调频收音机做为生日礼物。那些玩意都是骗人的，但从另外一方面来说，也只不过是个小把戏而已。不过，我必须承认，我和苏菲一样喜欢这些小把戏。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>P.S. In case you haven't been there yet, there are further instructions at the Danish Food store and the big Tax Free store that sells wines and tobacco. </p><p>PS：如果你还没有到那儿，丹麦食品店和那家很大的烟酒免税商店还有更进一步的指示。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>P.S. P.S. I got some money for my birthday, so I can contribute to the mini-TV with 350 crowns. Love, Hilde, who has already stuffed the turkey and made the Waldorf salad.</p><p>PS．PS：我生日时得到了一些钱，所以我可以资助你三百五十元买那架迷你电视。顺便告诉你，我已经把火鸡的肚子填好料了，也做了华尔道夫沙拉。爱你的席德。</p></div>
</div>
<div class='layout'><p>A mini-TV cost 985 Danish crowns. That could certainly be called a bagatelle in comparison with how Albert Knag felt about being directed hither and thither by his daughter's sneaky tricks. Was she here--or was she not?</p><p>一架迷你电视要九八五丹麦克朗。但比起艾勃特被女儿的诡计耍得团团转这件事，当然只能算是小事一桩。她到底在不在这里呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From that moment on, he was constantly on guard wherever he went. He felt like a secret agent and a marionette rolled into one. Was he not being deprived of his basic human rights?</p><p>从这时候起，他无论到哪里都留神提防。他觉得自己像个间谍，又像个木偶。他这可不是被剥夺了基本人权了吗？他也不得不到免税商店去。那儿又有一个写有他名字的信封。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He felt obliged to go into the Tax Free store as well. There hung a new envelope with his name on it. The whole airport was becoming a computer game with him as the cursor. He read the message:</p><p>这整座机场好像变成了一个电脑游戏，而他则是那个游标。他看着信封里的字条：</p></div>
<div class="lettle">
<div class='layout'><p>Major Knag, c/o the Tax Free store at Kastrup. All I need from here is a bag of gumdrops and some marzipan bars. Remember it's much more expensive in Norway. As far as I can recall, Mom is very fond of Campari. </p><p>请卡斯楚普机场免税商店转交艾勃特少校：我只想要一包酒味口香糖和几盒杏仁糖。记住，这类东西在挪威要贵得多。我记得妈很喜欢Campari。</p></div>

</div>
<div class='layout'><p>Albert sighed despairingly, but he went into the store and shopped as instructed. With three plastic carriers and his flight bag he walked toward Gate 28 to wait for his flight. If there were any more messages they would have to stay there.</p><p>艾勃特绝望地叹了口气，可是他还是进入店里，买了席德所说的东西。然后他便提了三个塑胶袋，背了一个飞行包，走向第二十八号登机门去等候他的班机。如果还有任何信，那他是看不到了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>However, at Gate 28 he caught sight of another white envelope taped to a pillar: "To Major Knag, c/o GATE 28, Kastrup Airport." This was also in Hilde's handwriting, but the gate number seemed to have been written by someone else. It was not easy to judge since there was no writing to compare it with, only block letters and digits. He took it down. This one said only "It won't be long now."</p><p>然而，他看到第二十八号登机门的一根柱子上也贴了一个信封：“请卡斯楚普机场第二十八号登机门转艾勃特少校”。上面的字也是席德的笔迹，但那个登机门的号码似乎是别人写的。但究竟是不是，也无从比对，因为那只是一些数字而已。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He sat down on a chair with his back against the wall. He kept the shopping bags on his knees. Thus the proud major sat stiffly, eyes straight ahead, like a small child traveling alone for the first time. If Hilde was here, she was certainly not going to have the satisfaction of dis-covering him first.He glanced anxiously at each passenger that came in. For a while he felt like an enemy of the state under close surveillance. When the passengers were finally allowed to board the plane he breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p>他坐在一张椅子上，背靠着墙，把购物袋放在膝盖上。就这样，这位一向自负的少校坐得挺直，目光注视前方，像个第一次自己出门的孩子。他心想，如果她在这儿，他才不会让她先发现他呢!他焦急地看着每一位进来的旅客。有一阵子，他觉得自己像一个被密切监视的敌方间谍。当旅客获许登机时，他才松了一口气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He was the last person to board. As he handed over his boarding pass he tore off another white envelope that had been taped to the check-in desk.</p><p>他是最后一个登机的人。当他交出他的登机证时，顺便撕下了另外一个贴在报到台的白色信封。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie and Alberto had passed Brevik, and a little later the exit to Kragera.</p><p>苏菲和艾伯特已经经过布列维克(Brevik)，没多久就到了通往卡拉杰罗(Krager)的出口。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You're going awfully fasf," said Sophie.</p><p>“你的时速已经开到一八O英里了。”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's almost nine o'clock. He'll soon be landing at Kjevik. But we won't be stopped for speeding."</p><p>“已经快九点了。他很快就要在凯耶维克机场着陆了。不过，你放心，我们不会因为超速被抓的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Suppose we smash into another car?"</p><p>“万一我们撞到别的车子怎么办？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It makes no difference if it's just an ordinary car. But if it's one of our own . . ."</p><p>“如果是一辆普通的车子就没关系，但如果是一辆像我们一样的子……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then what?"</p><p>“那会怎样？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Then we'll have to be very careful. Didn't you notice that we passed the Bat Mobile."</p><p>“那我们就要非常小心。你没注意到我们已经超过了蝙蝠侠的车……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No."</p><p>“没有。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It was parked somewhere up in Vestfold."</p><p>“它停在维斯特福(Vestfold)的某个地方。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"This tourist bus won't be easy to pass. There are dense woods on each side of the road."</p><p>“想超这辆游览车可不容易。路两旁都是浓密的树林。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It makes no difference, Sophie. Can't you get it into your head?"</p><p>“这没有什么差别。你难道就不能了解这点吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So saying, he swung the car into the woods and drove straight through the trees.</p><p>说完后，他把车子调个头就开进树林里，直直穿过那些浓密的树木。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>苏菲松了一口气。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You scared me."</p><p>“吓死我了!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We wouldn't feel it if we drove into a brick wall."</p><p>“就算开进一堵砖墙，我们也不会有感觉的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That only means we're spirits of the air compared to our surroundings."</p><p>“这只表示，和我们周遭的东西比起来，我们只不过是空气里的精灵而已。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No, now you're putting the cart before the horse. It is the reality around us that's an airy adventure to us."</p><p>“不，你这样说就本末倒置了。对我们来讲，我们周遭的现实世界才是像空气一般的奇怪东西。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I don't get it."</p><p>“我不懂。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Listen carefully, then. It is a widespread misunderstanding that spirit is a thing that is more 'airy' than vapor. On the contrary. Spirit is more solid than ice."</p><p>“那请你听好：很多人以为精灵是一种比烟雾还要‘缥缈’的东西。这是不对的。相反的，精灵比冰还要固体。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That never occurred to me."</p><p>“我从来没有想过是这样。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And now I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time there was a man who didn't believe in angels. One day, while he was out working in the woods, he was visited by an angel."</p><p>“现在我要告诉你一个故事。从前有一个男人，他不相信世上有天使。有一天，他到树林里工作时，有一个天使来找他。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And?"</p><p>“然后呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"They walked together for a while. Then the man turned to the angel and said, 'All right, now I have to admit that angels exist. But you don't exist in reality, like us."What do you mean by that?' asked the angel. So the man answered, 'When we came to that big rock, I had to go around it, but I noticed that you just glided through it. And when we came to that huge log that lay across the path, I had to climb over it while you walked straight through it.' The angel was very surprised, and said 'Didn't you also notice that we took a path that led through a marsh? We both walked right through the mist. That was because we were more solid than the mist.'</p><p>“他们一起走了一会儿。然后那个人转向天使说：‘好吧，现在我必须承认世上真的有天使。可是你不像我们一样真实。’‘你这话是什么意思？’天使问。这人回答道：‘我们刚才走到那块大石头的时候，我必须绕过去，而你却是直接走过去。’天使听了很惊讶，便说道：‘你难道没有注意到刚才我们经过了一个沼泽吗？我们两个都直接穿过那阵雾气。那是因为我们比雾气更固体呀？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Ah."</p><p>“啊!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It's the same with us, Sophie. Spirit can pass through steel doors. No tanks or bombers can crush anything that is of spirit."</p><p>“我们也是这样，苏菲。精灵可以穿过铁门。没有坦克或轰炸机可以压垮或炸毁任何一种由精灵做的东西。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's a comfort."</p><p>“这倒是挺令人安慰的。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll soon be passing Risor, and it's no more than an hour since we left the major's cabin. I could really use a cup of coffee."</p><p>“我们很快就要经过里棱(Risor)。而从我们离开少校的小木屋到现在顶多只有一个小时。我真想喝一杯咖啡。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When they got to Fiane, just before Sondeled, they passed a cafeteria on the lefthand side of the road. It was called Cinderella. Alberto swung the car around and parked on the grass in front of it.</p><p>当他们经过费安(Fiane)，还没到桑德雷德(Sondeled)时，在路的左边看到了一家名叫灰姑娘的餐馆。艾伯特将车子调头，停在它前面的苹地上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Inside, Sophie tried to take a bottle of Coke from the cooler, but she couldn't lift it. It seemed to be stuck. Further down the counter, Alberto was trying to tap coffee into a paper cup he had found in the car. He only had to press a lever, but even by exerting all his strength he could not press it down.</p><p>在餐馆里，苏菲试着从冰柜里拿出一瓶可乐，却举不起来。那瓶子似乎被粘紧了。在柜台另一边，艾伯特想把他在车里发现的一个纸杯注满咖啡。他只要把一根杆子压下就可以了，但他使尽了全身的力气却仍压不下去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This made him so mad that he turned to the cafeteria guests and asked for help. When no one reacted, he shouted so loudly that Sophie had to cover her ears: "I want some coffee!"</p><p>他气极了，于是向其他的顾客求助。当他们都没有反应时，他忍不住大声吼叫，吵得苏菲只好把耳朵遮起来：“我要喝咖啡！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His anger soon evaporated, and he doubled up with laughter. They were about to turn around and leave when an old woman got up from her chair and came toward them.</p><p>他的怒气很快就消失了，然后就开始大笑，笑得弯了腰。他们正要转身离去时，一个老妇人从她的椅子上站起来，向他们走过来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was wearing a garish red skirt, an ice-blue cardigan, and a white kerchief round her head. She seemed more sharply defined than anything else in the little cafeteria.</p><p>她穿着一条鲜艳的红裙，冰蓝色的羊毛上衣，绑着白色的头巾。这些衣服的颜色和形状似乎比这家小餐馆内的任何东西都要鲜明。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She went up to Alberto and said, "My my, how you do yell, my boy!"</p><p>她走到艾伯特身旁说：“乖乖，小男孩，你可真会叫呀！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Excuse me."</p><p>“对不起。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You want some coffee, you said?"</p><p>“你说你想喝点咖啡是吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but. . ."</p><p>“是的，不过……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We have a small establishment close by."</p><p>“我们在这附近有一家店。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They followed the old woman out of the cafeteria and down a path behind it. While they walked, she said, "You are new in these parts?"</p><p>他们跟着老妇人走出餐馆，沿着屋后一条小路往前走。走着走着，她说：“你们是新来的？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We might as well admit it," answered Alberto.</p><p>“我们不承认也不行。”艾伯特回答。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's all right. Welcome to eternity then, children."</p><p>“没关系。欢迎你们来到永恒之乡，孩子们。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you?"</p><p>“那你呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm out of one of Grimm's fairy tales. That was nearly two hundred years ago. And where are you from?"</p><p>“我是从格林童话故事来的。这已经是将近两百年前的事了。你们是打哪儿来的呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We're out of a book on philosophy. I am the philosophy teacher and this is my student, Sophie."</p><p>“我们是从一本哲学书里出来的。我是那个哲学老师，而这是我的学生苏菲。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hee hee! That's a new one!"</p><p>“嘻嘻!那可是一本新书哩！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They came through the trees to a small clearing where there were several cozy-looking brown cottages. A large Midsummer bonfire was burning in a yard between the cottages, and around the bonfire danced a crowd of colorful figures. Sophie recognized many of them. There were Snow White and some of the seven dwarfs, Mary Poppins and Sherlock Holmes, Peter Pan and Pippi Longstocking, Little Red Ridinghood and Cinderella. A lot of familiar figures without names had also gathered around the bonfire--there were gnomes and elves, fauns and witches, angels and imps. Sophie also caught sight of a real live troll.</p><p>他们穿过树林，走到一小块林间空地。那儿有几栋看起来很舒适的棕色小屋。在小屋之间的院子里，有一座很大的仲夏节火堆正在燃烧，火堆旁有一群五颜六色的人正在跳舞。其中许多苏菲都认得，有白雪公主和几个小矮人、懒杰克、福尔摩斯和小飞侠。小红帽和灰姑娘也在那儿。许多不知名的熟悉的人物也围在火堆旁，有地精、山野小精灵、半人半羊的农牧神、巫婆、天使和小鬼。苏菲还看到一个活生生的巨人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What a lot of noise!" exclaimed Alberto.</p><p>“多热闹呀！”艾伯特喊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"That's because it's Midsummer," said the old woman. "We haven't had a gathering like this since Valborg's Eve. That was when we were in Germany. I'm only here on a short visit. Was it coffee you wanted?"</p><p>“这是因为仲夏节到了，”老妇人回答说。“自从瓦普几司之夜(编按：五月一日前夕，据传在这一夜，女妖们会聚在布罗肯山上跳舞)过后，我们就不曾像这样聚在一起了。那时我们还在德国呢。我只是到这里来住一阵子的。你要的是咖啡吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, please."</p><p>“是的。麻烦你了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Not until now did Sophie notice that all the buildings were made out of gingerbread, candy, and sugar icing. Several of the figures were eating directly off the facades. A baker was going around repairing the damage as it occurred. Sophie ventured to take a little bite off one corner. It tasted sweeter and better than anything she had ever tasted before.</p><p>直到现在，苏菲才注意到所有的房子都是姜饼、糖果和糖霜做的。有几个人正直接吃着屋子前面的部分。一个女面包师正走来走去，忙着修补被吃掉的部分。苏菲大着胆子在屋角咬了一口，觉得比她从前所吃过的任何东西都更香甜美味。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Presently the old woman returned with a cup of coffee.</p><p>过一会儿，老妇人就端着一杯咖啡走过来了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Thank you very much indeed."</p><p>“真的很谢谢你。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And what are the visitors going to pay for the coffee?"</p><p>“不知道你们打算用什么来支付这杯咖啡？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To pay?"</p><p>“支付？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We usually pay with a story. For coffee, an old wives' tale will suffice."</p><p>“我们通常用故事来支付。一杯咖啡只要一个荒诞不经的故事就够了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We could tell the whole incredible story of humanity," said Alberto, "but unfortunately we are in a hurry. Can we come back and pay some other day?"</p><p>“我们可以讲一整个关于人类的不可思议的故事，”艾伯特说，“可是很遗憾我们赶时间。我们可不可以改天再回来付？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Of course. And why are you in a hurry?"</p><p>“当然可以。但你们为什么会这么赶时间呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto explained their errand, and the old woman commented: "I must say, you certainly are a pair of greenhorns. You'd better hurry up and cut the umbilical cord to your mortal progenitor. We no longer need their world. We belong to the invisible people."</p><p>艾伯特解释了他们要做的事。老妇人听了以后便说：“我不得不说你们真是太嫩了。你们最好快点剪断你们和那凡人祖先之间的脐带吧，我们已经不需要他们的世界了。我们现在是一群隐形人。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto and Sophie hurried back to the Cinderella cafeteria and the red convertible. Right next to the car a busy mother was helping her little boy to pee.</p><p>艾伯特和苏菲匆忙赶回灰姑娘餐馆去开他们那辆红色的敞篷车。这时车旁正有一位忙碌的母亲为她的小男孩把尿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Racing along and taking shortcuts, they soon arrived in Lillesand.</p><p>他们风驰电掣地开过树丛和荆棘，并不时走天然的捷径，很快地就到了黎乐桑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>SK 876 from Copenhagen touched down at Kjevik on schedule at 9:35 p.m. While the plane was taxied out to the runway in Copenhagen, the.major had opened the envelope hanging from the check-in desk. The note inside read:</p><p>从哥本哈根开来的SK八七六号班机二十一点三十五分在凯耶维克机场着陆。当飞机在哥本哈根的跑道上滑行时，艾勃特少校打开了那个贴在报到台上的信封。里面的字条写着：</p></div>
<div class="lettle">

<div class="layout">
<p>To Major Knag, as he hands over his boarding pass at Kastrup on Midsummer Eve, 1990. </p>
<p>致：艾勃特少校，请在他于一九九O年仲夏节在卡斯楚普机场交出他的登机证时转交。</p>
</div>
<div class='layout'>
<p style="text-indent:0em">Dear Dad, </p>
<p style="text-indent:0em">亲爱的爸爸：</p>
</div>
<div class='layout'><p>You probably thought I would turn up in Copenhagen. But my control over your movements is more ingenious than that. I can see you wherever you are, Dad. The fact is, I have been to visit a well-known Gypsy family which many, many years ago sold a magic brass mirror to Great-grandmother. I have also gotten myself a crystal ball. At this very moment, I can see that you have just sat down in your seat. May I remind you to fasten your seat belt and keep the back of your seat raised to an upright position until the Fasten Seat Belt sign has been switched off. As soon as the plane is in flight, you can lower the seat back and give yourself a well-earned rest. You will need to be rested when you get home. The weather in Lillesand is perfect, but the temperature is a few degrees lower than in Lebanon. I wish you a pleasant flight. Love, your own witch-daughter, Queen of the Mirror and the Highest Protector of Irony.</p><p>你可能以为我会在哥本哈根机场出现。可是我对你的行踪的控制要比这更复杂。爸，无论你在哪里，我都可以看到你。老实说，我曾经去拜访过许多许多年前卖一面魔镜给曾祖母的那个很有名的吉普赛家庭，并且买了一个水晶球。此时此刻，我可以看到你刚在你的位子上坐下。请客我提醒你系紧安全带，并把椅背竖直，直到“系紧安全带”的灯号熄灭为止。飞机一起飞，你就可以把椅背放低，好好地休息。在你回到家前，你需要有充分的休息。黎乐桑的天气非常好，但气温比黎巴嫩低了好几度。祝你旅途愉快。你的巫婆女儿、镜里的皇后和反讽的最高守护神席德敬上。</p></div>

</div>
<div class='layout'><p>Albert could not quite make out whether he was angry or merely tired and resigned. Then he started laughing. He laughed so loudly that his fellow passengers turned to stare at him. Then the plane took off.</p><p>艾勃特分不清自己究竟是生气，或者只是疲倦而无奈。然后他开始笑起来。他笑得如此大声，以至于别的乘客转过身来瞪着他，然后飞机就起飞了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He had been given a taste of his own medicine. But with a significant difference, surely. His medicine had first and foremost affected Sophie and Alberto. And they--well, they were only imaginary.</p><p>这是以其人之道还治其人之身了，但两者之间当然有很大的不同。他的做法只影响到苏菲和艾伯特，而他们毕竟只是虚构的人物。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He did what Hilde had suggested. He lowered the back of his seat and nodded off. He was not fully awake again until he had gone through passport control and was standing in the arrival hall at Kjevik Airport. A demonstration was there to greet him.</p><p>他按照席德所建议的，把椅背放低，开始打瞌睡。一直到通关后，站在凯耶维克机场的入境大厅时，他才完全清醒。这时他看到有人在示威。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were eight or ten young people of about Hilde's age. They were holding signs saying: </p><p>总共有八个或十个大约与席德一般大的年轻人。他们手里举的牌子上写着：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>WELCOME HOME, DAD -- HILDE IS WAITING IN THE GARDEN -- IRONY LIVES.</p><p>“爸爸，欢迎回家！“席德正在花园里等候。”反讽万岁！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The worst thing was that he could not just jump into a taxi. He had to wait for his baggage. And all the while, Hilde's classmates were swarming around him, forcing him to read the signs again and again. Then one of the girls came up and gave him a bunch of roses and he melted. He dug down into one of his shopping bags and gave each demonstrator a marzipan bar. Now there were only two left for Hilde. When he had reclaimed his baggage, a young man stepped forward and explained that he was under the command of the Queen of the Mirror, and that he had orders to drive him to Bjerkely. The other demonstrators dispersed into the crowd.</p><p>最糟的是他不能就这样跳进一辆计程车，因为他还要等他的行李。这段时间，席德的同学一直在他旁边走来走去，使他不得不一而再、再而三地看到那些牌子。然后有一个女孩走上来，给了他一束玫瑰花，他就心软了。他在一个购物袋里摸索，给了每个示威者一条杏仁糖。这样一来只剩下两条给席德了。他领了行李后，一个年轻人走过来，说他是“镜子皇后”的属下，奉命要载他回柏客来山庄。其他的示威者就消失在人群里了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They drove out onto the E 18. Every bridge and tunnel they passed was draped with banners saying: "Welcome home!", "The turkey is ready," "I can see you, Dad!"</p><p>他们的车子开在E一八号路上，沿途经过的每一座桥和每一条隧道都挂着布条，写着：“欢迎回家!”火鸡已经好了。…‘爸，我可以看见你!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he was dropped off outside the gate at Bjerkely, Albert Knag heaved a sigh of relief, and thanked the driver with a hundred crown note and three cans of Carlsberg Elephant beer.</p><p>当他在柏客来山庄的门口下车时，艾勃特松了一口气，并给了那位开车送他的人一百块钱和三罐象牌啤酒表示感谢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His wife was waiting for him outside the house. After a long embrace, he asked: "Where is she?"</p><p>他的妻子玛丽特正在屋外等他。在一阵长长的拥抱之后，他问：“她在哪里？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She's sitting on the dock, Albert."</p><p>“坐在平台上面。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Alberto and Sophie stopped the red convertible on the square in Lillesand outside the Hotel Norge. It was a quarter past ten. They could see a large bonfire out in the archipelago.</p><p>艾伯特和苏菲把那辆红色的敞篷车停在黎乐桑诺芝(Norge)旅馆外的广场上时，已经是十点十五分了。他们可以看到远处的列岛有一座很大的火堆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "How do we find Bjerkely?" asked Sophie.</p><p>“我们怎样才能找到柏客来山庄呢？”苏菲问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll just have to hunt around for it. You remember the painting in the major's cabin."</p><p>“我们只好到处碰运气了。你应该还记得少校的小木屋里的那幅画吧。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll have to hurry. I want to get there before he arrives."</p><p>“我们得赶快了。我想在他抵达前赶到那儿。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They started to drive around the minor roads and then over rocky mounds and slopes. A useful clue was that Bjerkely lay by the water.</p><p>他们开始沿着较小的路到处开，然后又开上岩堆和斜坡。有一个很有用的线索就是柏客来山庄位于海边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly Sophie shouted, "There it is! We've found it!"</p><p>突然间，苏菲喊：“到了!我们找到了!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I do believe you're right, but don't shout so loud."</p><p>“我想你说得没错，可是你不要叫这么大声好吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Why? There's no one to hear us."</p><p>“为什么？又没有人会听到我们。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"My dear Sophie--after a whole course in philosophy, I'm very disappointed to find you still jumping to conclusions."</p><p>“苏菲，在我们上完了一整门哲学课之后，你还是这么妄下结论，真是使我很失望。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, but. . ."</p><p>“我知道，可是……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Surely you don't believe this place is entirely devoid of trolls, pixies, wood nymphs, and good fairies?"</p><p>“你不会以为这整个地方都没有巨人、小妖精、山林女神和好仙女吧？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, excuse me."</p><p>“喔，对不起。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They drove through the gate and up the gravel path to the house. Alberto parked the car on the lawn beside the glider. A little way down the garden a table was set for three.</p><p>他们开过大门口，循着石子路到房子那儿。艾伯特把车停在草坪上的秋千旁。在不远处放着一张有三个位子的桌子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I can see her!" whispered Sophie. "She's sitting down on the dock, just like in my dream."</p><p>“我看见她了!”苏菲低声说。“她正坐在平台上，就像上次在我梦里一样。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have you noticed how much the garden looks like your own garden in Clover Close?"</p><p>“你有没有注意到这座花园多么像你在苜蓿巷的园子呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, it does. With the glider and everything. Can I go down to her?"</p><p>“嗯，真的很像。有秋千呀什么的。我可以去找她吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Naturally. I'll stay here."</p><p>“当然可以。你去吧，我留在这里。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie ran down to the dock. She almost stumbled and fell over Hilde. But she sat down politely beside her.</p><p>苏菲跑到平台那儿。她差点撞到席德的身上，但她很有礼貌地坐在她旁边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde sat idly playing with the line that the rowboat was made fast with. In her left hand she held a slip of paper. She was clearly waiting. She glanced at her watch several times.</p><p>席德坐在那儿，闲闲地玩弄着那条系小舟的绳索。她的左手拿着一小张纸，显然正在等待。她看了好几次表。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie thought she was very pretty. She had fair, curly hair and bright green eyes. She was wearing a yellow summer dress. She was not unlike Joanna.</p><p>苏菲认为她满可爱的。她有一头金色的卷发和一双明亮的绿色眼睛，身穿一件黄色的夏装，样子有点像乔安。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie tried to talk to her even though she knew it was useless.</p><p>虽然明知道没有用，但苏菲还是试着和她说话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hilde--it's Sophie!"</p><p>“席德，我是苏菲!” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde gave no sign that she had heard.</p><p>席德显然没有听到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie got onto her knees and tried to shout in her ear:"Can you hear me, Hilde? Or are you both deaf and blind?"</p><p>苏菲跪坐着，试图在她耳朵旁边大喊：“你听得到我吗？席德，还是你既瞎又聋呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Did she, or didn't she, open her eyes a little wider? Wasn't there a very slight sign that she had heard something--however faintly?</p><p>她是否曾把她的眼睛稍微张大一点呢？不是已经有一点点迹象显示她听见了一些什么吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She looked around. Then she turned her head sharply and stared right into Sophie's eyes. She did not focus on her properly; it was as if she was looking right through her.</p><p>她看看四周，然后突然转过头直视着苏菲的眼睛。她视线的焦点并没有放在苏菲身上，仿佛是穿透苏菲而看着某个东西一般。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Not so loud, Sophie," said Alberto from up in the car. "I don't want the garden filled with mermaids."</p><p>“苏菲，不要叫这么大声。”艾伯特从车里向她说。“我可不希望这花园里到处都是美人鱼。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie sat still now. It felt good just to be close to Hilde.</p><p>于是苏菲坐着不动。只要能靠近席德她就心满意足了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then she heard the deep voice of a man: "Hilde!"</p><p>然后她听到一个男人用浑厚的声音在叫：“席德！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was the major--in uniform, with a blue beret. He stood at the top of the garden.</p><p>是少校!穿着制服，戴着蓝扁帽，站在花园最高处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde jumped up and ran toward him. They met between the glider and the red convertible. He lifted her up in the air and swung her around and around.</p><p>席德跳起来，跑向他。他们在秋千和红色的敞篷车间会合了。他把她举起来，转了又转。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde had been sitting on the dock waiting for her father. Since he had landed at Kastrup, she had thought of him every fifteen minutes, trying to imagine where he was now, and how he was taking it. She had noted all the times down on a slip of paper and kept it with her all day.</p><p>席德坐在平台上等候她的父亲。自从他在卡斯楚普机场着陆后，她每隔十五分钟就会想到他一次，试着想象他在哪里，有什么反应。她把每一次的想法都记在一张纸上，整天都带着它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What if it made him angry? But surely he couldn't expect that he would write a mysterious book for her-- and then everything would remain as before?She looked at her watch again. Now it was a quarter past ten. He could be arriving any minute.</p><p>万一他生气了怎么办？可是他该不会以为在他为她写了一本神秘的书以后，一切都会和从前一样吧？她再度看看表。已经十点十五分了。他随时可能会到家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But what was that? She thought she heard a faint breath of something, exactly as in her dream about Sophie.</p><p>不过，那是什么声音？她好像听到了一种微弱的呼吸声，就像她梦见苏菲的情景一样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She turned around quickly. There was something, she was sure of it. But what?Maybe it was only the summer night.</p><p>她很快转过头。——定有个什么东西，她很确定。可是到底是什么呢？也许是夏夜的关系吧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a few seconds she was afraid she was hearing things.</p><p>有几秒钟，她觉得好像又听见了什么声音。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Hilde!"</p><p>“席德！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now she turned the other way. It was Dad! He was standing at the top of the garden.</p><p>她把头转到另外一边。是爸爸!他正站在花园的最高处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde jumped up and ran toward him. They met by the glider. He lifted her up in the air and swung her around and around.</p><p>席德跳起来跑向他。他们在秋千旁相遇。他把她举起来，转了又转。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde was crying, and her father had to hold back his tears as well.</p><p>席德哭起来了，而她爸爸则忍住了眼泪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"You've become a grown woman, Hilde!"</p><p>“你已经变成一个女人了，席德！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And you've become a real writer."</p><p>“而你真的变成了作家。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hilde wiped away her tears.</p><p>席德用身上那件黄色的洋装擦了擦眼泪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Shall we say we're quits?" she asked.</p><p>“怎样，我们现在是不是平手了？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We're quits."</p><p>“对，平手了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>They sat down at the table. First of all Hilde had to have an exact description of everything that had happened at Kastrup and on the way home. They kept bursting out laughing.</p><p>他们在桌旁坐下。首先席德向爸爸一五一十地诉说如何安排卡斯楚普机场和他回家的路上那些事情。说着说着，他们俩不时爆出一阵又一阵响亮的笑声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Didn't you see the envelope in the cafeteria?"</p><p>“你没有看见餐厅里的那封信吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I didn't get a chance to sit down and eat anything, you villain. Now I'm ravenous."</p><p>“我都没时间坐下来吃东西，你这个小坏蛋。现在我可是饿惨了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Poor Dad."</p><p>“可怜的爸爸。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"The stuff about the turkey was all bluff, then?"</p><p>“你说的关于火鸡的事全是骗人的吧？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It certainly was not! I have prepared everything. Mom's doing the serving."</p><p>“当然不是！我都弄好了。妈妈正在切呢。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then they had to go over the ring binder and the story of Sophie and Alberto from one end to the other and backwards and forwards.</p><p>然后他们又谈了关于讲义夹和苏菲、艾伯特的故事，从头讲到尾，从尾又讲到头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mom brought out the turkey and the Waldorf salad, the rose wine and Hilde's homemade bread.</p><p>然后席德的妈妈就端着火鸡、沙拉、粉红葡萄酒和席德做的乡村面包来了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her father was just saying something about Plato when Hilde suddenly interrupted him: "Shh!"</p><p>当爸爸正说到有关柏拉图的事时，席德突然打断他：“嘘！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is it?"</p><p>“什么事？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Didn't you hear it? Something squeaking?"</p><p>“你听到没有？好像有个东西在吱吱叫。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"No."</p><p>“没有。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm sure I heard something. I guess it was just a field mouse."</p><p>“我确定我听到了。我猜大概只是一只地鼠。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While her mother went to get another bottle of wine, her father said: "But the philosophy course isn't quite over."</p><p>当妈妈去拿另外一瓶酒时，席德的爸爸说：“可是哲学课还没完全结束呢。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"It isn't?"</p><p>“是吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Tonight I'm going to tell you about the universe."</p><p>“今晚我要告诉你有关宇宙的事情。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Before they began to eat, he said to his wife, "Hilde is too big to sit on my knee any more. But you're not!" </p><p>在他们开始用餐前，他说：“席德现在已经太大，不能再坐在我的膝盖上了。可是你不会。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With that he caught Marit round the waist and drew her onto his lap. It was quite a while before she got anything to eat.</p><p>说完他便一把搂住玛丽特的腰，把她拉到他的怀中。过了好一会，她才开始吃东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"To think you'll soon be forty ..."</p><p>“想想你就快四十岁了……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Hilde jumped up and ran toward her father, Sophie felt her tears welling up. She would never be able to reach her . . .</p><p>当席德跳起来冲向她父亲时，苏菲觉得自己的眼泪不断涌出。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie was deeply envious of Hilde because she had been created a real person of flesh and blood.</p><p>她永远没法与她沟通了……苏菲很羡慕席德，因为她生下来就是一个活生生、有血有肉的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Hilde and the major had sat down at the table, Alberto honked the car horn.</p><p>当席德和少校坐在餐桌旁时，艾伯特按了一下汽车的喇叭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie looked up. Didn't Hilde do exactly the same?She ran up to Alberto and jumped into the seat next to him.</p><p>苏菲抬起头看。席德不也做了同样的动作吗？她跑到艾伯特那儿，跳进他旁边的座位上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We'll sit for a while and watch what happens," he said.</p><p>“我们在这儿坐一下，看看会发生什么事。”他说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sophie nodded.</p><p>苏菲点点头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Have you been crying?"</p><p>“你哭了吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She nodded again.</p><p>她再度点头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"What is it?"</p><p>“怎么回事？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She's so lucky to be a real person. Now she'll grow up and be a real woman. I'm sure she'll have real children too . . ."</p><p>“她真幸运，可以做一个真正的人……她以后会长大，变成一个真正的女人……我敢说她一定也会生一些真正的小孩……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"And grandchildren, Sophie. But there are two sides to everything. That was what I tried to teach you at the beginning of our course."</p><p>“还有孙子，苏菲。可是任何事情都有两面。这就是我在哲学课开始时想要教你的事情。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"How do you mean?"</p><p>“这话怎么说呢？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"She is lucky, I agree. But she who wins the lot of life must also draw the lot of death, since the lot of life is death."</p><p>“她的确是很幸运，这点我同意。但是有生必然也会有死，因为生就是死。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But still, isn't it better to have had a life than never to have really lived?"</p><p>“可是，曾经活过不是比从来没有恰当地活要好些吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"We cannot live a life like Hilde--or like the major for that matter. On the other hand, we'll never die. Don't you remember what the old woman said back there in the woods? We are the invisible people. She was two hundred years old, she said. And at their Midsummer party I saw some creatures who were more than three thousand years old . . ."</p><p>“我们当然不能过像席德或少校那样的生活。可是从另一方面来说，我们也永远不会死。你不记得树林里那位老妇人说的话了吗？我们是一些隐形人。她还说她已经两百岁了。在他们那个仲夏节庆祝会上，我看到一些已经三千多岁的人……” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> "Perhaps what I envy most about Hilde is all this ……her family life."</p><p>“也许我最羡慕席德的是……她的家庭生活。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But you have a family yourself. And you have a cat, two birds, and a tortoise."</p><p>“可是你自己也有家呀。你还有一只猫、两只鸟和一只乌龟。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"But we left all that behind, didn't we?"</p><p>“可是我们把那些东西都抛在身后了，不是吗？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"By no means. It's only the major who left it behind. He has written the final word of his book, my dear, and he will never find us again."</p><p>“绝不是这样，只有少校一个人把它抛在身后。他已经打上了最后一个句点了，孩子，他以后再也找不到我们了。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Does that mean we can go back?"</p><p>“这是不是说我们可以回去了？” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>"Anytime we want. But we're also going to make new friends in the woods behind Cinderella's cafeteria."</p><p>“随时都可以，可是我们也要回到灰姑娘餐厅后面的树林里去交一些新朋友。” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Knag family began their meal. For a moment Sophie was afraid it would turn out like the philosophical garden party in Clover Close. At one point it looked as though the major intended to lay Marit across the table. But then he drew her on to his knee instead.</p><p>艾勃特一家开始用餐。苏菲有一度很害怕他们的情况会像苜蓿巷哲学花园宴会一样，因为有一次少校似乎想把玛丽特按在桌上，可是后来他把她拉到了怀中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The car was parked a good way away from where the family sat eating. Their conversation was only audible now and then. Sophie and Alberto sat gazing down over the garden.
