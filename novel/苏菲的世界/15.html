<p>15 The Middle Ages</p>

<p>15 中世纪</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>…… going only part of the way is not the same as going the wrong way……</p>

<p>……对了一部分并不等于错……</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>A week passed without Sophie hearing from Alberto Knox. There were no more postcards from Lebanon either, although she and Joanna still talked about the cards they found in the major's cabin. Joanna had had the fright of her life, but as nothing further seemed to hap-pen, the immediate terror faded and was submerged in homework and badminton.</p>

<p>一个星期过去了，艾伯特并没有来信，苏菲也没有再接到从黎巴嫩寄来的明信片。不过，她和乔安倒是还时常谈到她们在少校的小木屋中发现的那些明信片。那次乔安真的是被吓到了。不过由于后来也没有再发生什么事，于是当时的恐怖感就慢慢消退在功课与羽球之中了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie read Alberto's letters over and over, looking for some clue that would throw light on the Hilde mystery. Doing so also gave her plenty of opportunity to digest the classical philosophy. She no longer had difficulty in distinguishing Democritus and Socrates, or Plato and Aristotle, from each other.</p>

<p>苏菲一遍遍重读艾伯特的来信，试图寻找一些线索以解答有关席德的谜，她因此有许多机会消化古典哲学。现在她已经能够轻易地辨别德谟克里特斯与苏格拉底的不同，以及柏拉图与亚理斯多德的差异了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>On Friday, May 25, she was in the kitchen fixing dinner before her mother got home. It was their regular Friday agreement. Today she was making fish soup with fish balls and carrots. Plain and simple.</p>

<p>五月二十五日星期五那天，妈妈还没有回家。苏菲站在炉子前准备晚餐。这是他们母女订的协议。今天苏菲煮的是鱼丸萝卜汤，再简单不过了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Outside it was becoming windy. As Sophie stood stirring the casserole she turned toward the window. The birch trees were waving like cornstalks.</p>

<p>屋外的风愈来愈大。苏菲站在那儿搅拌着汤时，转身朝窗户看。窗外的桦树正像玉蜀黍茎一般地摇摆不定。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Suddenly something smacked against the window-pane. Sophie turned around again and discovered a card sticking to the window.</p>

<p>突然间，有个东西“啪”一声碰到窗框。苏菲再度转身来看，发现有一张卡片贴在窗户上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>It was a postcard. She could read it through the glass: "Hilde Moller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen."</p>

<p>那是一张明信片。即使透过玻璃，她也可以看清楚，上面写着：“请苏菲代转席德”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She thought as much! She opened the window and took the card. It could hardly have blown all the way from Lebanon!</p>

<p>她早料到了。她打开窗户取下那张明信片，它总不会是被风一路从黎巴嫩吹到这里来的吧？这张明信片的日期也是六月十五日。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>This card was also dated June 15. Sophie removed the casserole from the stove and sat down at the kitchen table. The card read:</p>

<p>苏菲把汤从炉子上端下来，然后坐在餐桌旁。明信片上写着：</p></div>



<div class="lettle">
<div class='layout'>
<p style="text-indent:0em">Dear Hilde, </p>
<p style="text-indent:0em">亲爱的席德：</p>
</div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>I don't know whether it will still be your birthday when you read this card. I hope so, in a way; or at least that not too many days have gone by. A week or two for Sophie does not have to mean just as long for us. I shall be coming home for Midsummer Eve, so we can sit together for hours in the glider, looking out over the sea, Hilde. We have so much to talk about. Love from Dad, who sometimes gets very depressed about the thousand-year-long strife between Jews, Christians, and Muslims. </p>

<p>我不知道你看到这张卡片时，你的生日过了没有。我希望还没有，至少不要过大久。对于苏菲来说，一两个星期也许不像我们认为的那么漫长。我将回家过仲夏节。到时，我们就可以一起坐在秋千上看海看几个小时。我有好多话要跟你说。对了，爸爸我有时对一千年来犹太人、基督徒与伊斯兰教徒之间的纷争感到非常沮丧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>I have to keep reminding myself that all three religions stem from Abraham. So I suppose they all pray to the same God. Down here, Cain and Abel have not finished killing each other.</p>

<p>我必须时常提醒自己，这三个宗教事实上都是从亚伯拉罕而来的。因此，我想，他们应该都向同一个上帝祷告吧！在这里，该隐与亚伯仍然还未停止互相残杀。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>P.S. Please say hello to Sophie. Poor child, she still doesn't know how this whole thing hangs together. But perhaps you do?</p>

<p>P．S：请替我向苏菲打招呼。可怜的孩子，她还是不知道这到底是怎么回事。不过我想你大概知道吧！</p></div>
</div>

<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie put her head down on the table, exhausted. One thing was certain--she had no idea how this thing hung together. But Hilde did, presumably.</p>

<p>苏菲把头趴在桌子上，觉得好累。她的确不知道这究竟是怎么回事。不过席德却好像知道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>If Hilde's father asked her to say hello to Sophie, it had to mean that Hilde knew more about Sophie than Sophie did about Hilde. It was all so complicated that Sophie went back to fixing dinner.</p>

<p>如果席德的父亲要她向苏菲打招呼，这表示席德对苏菲的了解比苏菲对她的了解多。这件事情实在太复杂了。苏菲决定回去继续做晚饭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>A postcard that smacked against the kitchen window all by itself! You could call that airmail!</p>

<p>居然有明信片会自己飞到厨房的窗户上来！这应该可以算是航空邮件了吧！</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>As soon as she had set the casserole on the stove again, the telephone rang.</p>

<p>她刚把汤锅放在炉子上，电话就响了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Suppose it was Dad! She wished desperately that he would come home so she could tell him everything that had happened in these last weeks. But it was probably only Joanna or Mom. Sophie snatched up the phone.</p>

<p>如果是爸爸打来的该多好！她急切希望他赶快回家，她就可以告诉他这几个礼拜以来发生的事。不过她想很可能只是乔安或妈妈打来的……苏菲赶快拿起话筒。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Sophie Amundsen," she said.</p>

<p>“我是苏菲。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "It's me," said a voice.</p>

<p>“是我。”电话里的声音说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie was sure of three things: it was not her father. But it was a man's voice, and a voice she knew she had heard before.</p>

<p>是一个男人的声音。苏菲可以确定这人不是她爸爸，而且这个声音她以前听过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Who is this?"</p>

<p>“你是哪一位？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's Alberto."</p>

<p>“我是艾伯特。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Ohhh!"</p>

<p>“哦！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie was at a loss for words. It was the voice from the Acropolis video that she had recognized.</p>

<p>苏菲讲不出话来。她这才想到原来自己是在高城的录影带上听过这个声音。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Are you all right?"</p>

<p>“你还好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>“我没事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"From now on there will be no more letters."</p>

<p>“从现在起，我不会再寄信给你了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But I didn't send you a frog!"</p>

<p>“不过，我并没有寄一只青蛙给你呀！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We must meet in person. It's beginning to be urgent, you see."</p>

<p>“我们必须见面。因为，情况开始变得比较急迫了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>“为什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Hilde's father is closing in on us."</p>

<p>“因为席德的爸爸正在向我们逼近。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Closing in how?"</p>

<p>“怎么逼近？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"On all sides, Sophie. We have to work together now."</p>

<p>“从四面八方逼近。现在我们必须一起努力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"How……?"</p>

<p>“怎么做呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But you can't help much before I have told you about the Middle Ages. We ought to cover the Renaissance and the seventeenth century as well. Berkeley is a key figure……"</p>

<p>“在我告诉你有关中世纪的事以前，你是帮不上什么忙的。还有，我们也应该谈一谈文艺复兴时期和十七世纪。柏克莱是最重要的人物……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Wasn't he the man in the picture at the major's cabin?"</p>

<p>“他不是少校的小木屋里那幅肖像画中的人吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That very same. Maybe the actual struggle will be waged over his philosophy."</p>

<p>“没错。也许这场对抗就是和他的哲学有关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You make it sound like a war."</p>

<p>“听起来好像在打仗一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I would rather call it a battle of wills. We have to attract Hilde's attention and get her over on our side before her father comes home to Lillesand."</p>

<p>“我宁可说这是一场意志之战。我们必须吸引席德的注意力，并且设法使她在她父亲回到黎乐桑之前站在我们这边。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I don't get it at all."</p>

<p>“我还是不懂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Perhaps the philosophers can open your eyes. Meet me at St. Mary's Church at eight o'clock tomorrow morning. But come alone, my child."</p>

<p>“也许那些哲学家们能够让你明白。早上四点你到圣玛莉教堂来找我，不过你只能一个人来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So early in the morning?"</p>

<p>“半夜去呀？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The telephone clicked.</p>

<p>电话“卡！”的响了一声。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Hello?"</p>

<p>“喂？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>He had hung up! </p>

<p>电话里传来嗡嗡的声音。他把电话挂上了！苏菲冲回炉子旁，汤已经沸腾，差点溢了出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie rushed back to the stove just before the fish soup boiled over.</p>

<p>她把鱼丸和萝卜放进汤锅中，然后开小火。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>St. Mary's Church? That was an old stone church from the Middle Ages. It was only used for concerts and very special ceremonies. And in the summer it was sometimes open to tourists. But surely it wasn't open in the middle of the night?</p>

<p>圣玛莉教堂？那是一座中世纪的古老教堂，以石材建成，现在只有在开音乐会及特殊场合时才使用，夏天有时也会开放给游客参观。不过，半夜里它不可能会开门吧？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>When her mother got home, Sophie had put the card from Lebanon with everything else from Alberto and Hilde. After dinner she went over to Joanna's place.</p>

<p>当妈妈进门时，苏菲已经把那张黎巴嫩寄来的明信片放在与艾伯特和席德有关的档案里。晚饭后，她便前往乔安家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We have to make a very special arrangement," she said as soon as her friend opened the door.</p>

<p>乔安刚开门，苏菲便对她说：“我们必须做一个很特别的安排”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She said no more until Joanna had closed her bedroom door.</p>

<p>然后她便不再作声，直到乔安把卧室的门关上为止。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's rather problematic," Sophie went on.</p>

<p>“这问题有点麻烦。”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Spit it out!"</p>

<p>“你就说吧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I'm going to have to tell Mom that I'm staying the night here."</p>

<p>“我必须告诉我妈，我今天晚上要睡在你这里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Great!"</p>

<p>“好极了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But it's only something I'm saying, you see. I've got to go somewhere else."</p>

<p>“但这只是一个借口而已，你懂吗？我必须到别的地方去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's bad. Is it a guy?"</p>

<p>“你好坏喔！要跟男生出去呀？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No, it's to do with Hilde."</p>

<p>“才不是，这件事和席德有关。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Joanna whistled softly, and Sophie looked her severely in the eye.</p>

<p>乔安轻轻地吹了一声口哨。苏菲严肃地看着她的眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I'm coming over this evening," she said, "but at seven o'clock I've got to sneak out again. You've got to cover for me until I get back."</p>

<p>“我今天晚上会过来，”她说。“不过明天凌晨三点时，我必须溜出去。你得帮我掩护，直到我回来为止。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But where are you going? What is it you have to do?"</p>

<p>“可是你要到哪里去呢？有什么事你非做不可？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Sorry. My lips are sealed."</p>

<p>“抱歉，不能告诉你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sleepovers were never a problem. On the contrary, almost. Sometimes Sophie got the impression that her mother enjoyed having the house to herself.</p>

<p>对于苏菲要在同学家过夜的事，妈妈一向不曾反对。事实上有时苏菲觉得妈妈好像满喜欢一个人在家的样子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You'll be home for breakfast, I suppose?" was her mother's only remark as Sophie left the house.</p>

<p>当苏菲出门时，妈妈只问了一句：“你会回家吃早饭吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"If I'm not, you know where I am."</p>

<p>“如果没回来，那就是在乔安家。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>What on earth made her say that? It was the one weak spot.</p>

<p>她为什么要这样说呢？这样可能会有破绽。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie's visit began like any other sleepover, with talk until late into the night. The only difference was that when they finally settled down to sleep at about two o'clock, Sophie set the alarm clock to a quarter to seven.</p>

<p>苏菲到了乔安家后，她俩就像一般的女孩一样，叽叽喳喳聊到深夜。只不过，到了晚上一点左右他们终于准备要睡觉时，苏菲把闹钟上到三点十五分。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Five hours later, Joanna woke briefly as Sophie switched off the buzzer.</p>

<p>两个小时后，苏菲把闹钟按掉，这时乔安醒了一下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Take care," she mumbled.</p>

<p>“你要小心。”她含含糊糊地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Then Sophie was on her way. St. Mary's Church lay on the outskirts of the old part of town. It was several miles walk away, but even though she had only slept for a few hours she felt wide awake.</p>

<p>然后苏菲便上路了。到圣玛莉教堂要走好几英里路。不过虽然她晚上只睡了两三个小时，此刻她仍觉得自己很清醒。这时，东方的地平线上已经有一抹微红。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>It was almost eight o'clock when she stood at the entrance to the old stone church. Sophie tried the massive door. It was unlocked!</p>

<p>她到达圣玛莉教堂的入口时，已经快要四点了。苏菲推了一下那扇巨大的门，竟然没有上锁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Inside the church it was as deserted and silent as the church was old. A bluish light filtered in through the stained-glass windows revealing a myriad of tiny particles of dust hovering in the air. The dust seemed to gather in thick beams this way and that inside the church. Sophie sat on one of the benches in the center of the nave, staring toward the altar at an old crucifix painted with muted colors.</p>

<p>教堂里面安静而荒凉。一道淡蓝色的光透过彩色玻璃照进来。照见了无数个在空中游移不定的细小尘粒。在光的照射下，这些尘粒在教堂内各处形成一道又一道粗大的光束。苏菲坐在本堂中央的一张木椅上，视线穿过祭坛，落在一个古老、已经褪色的耶稣受难像上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Some minutes passed. Suddenly the organ began to play. Sophie dared not look around. It sounded like an ancient hymn, probably from the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>几分钟过去了。突然间管风琴开始演奏，苏菲不敢环顾四周。风琴奏出的曲调听起来颇为古老，也许是中世纪的乐曲。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>There was silence again. Then she heard footsteps approaching from behind her. Should she look around? She chose instead to fix her eyes on the Cross.</p>

<p>不久，教堂内又恢复一片静寂，然后苏菲听到有脚步声从后面走来。她应不应该回头看呢？她决定把目光集中在十字架上的耶稣身上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The footsteps passed her on their way up the aisle and she saw a figure dressed in a brown monk's habit. Sophie could have sworn it was a monk right out of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>脚步声经过她，沿着侧廊前行。苏菲看到一个穿着棕色僧袍的身影，乍看之下仿佛是直接从中世纪走来的一个僧侣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She was nervous, but not scared out of her wits. In front of the altar the monk turned in a half-circle and then climbed up into the pulpit. He leaned over the edge, looked down at Sophie, and addressed her in Latin:</p>

<p>她有点紧张但不很害怕。这个僧侣在祭坛前转了半圈，然后便爬上讲坛。他把身子前倾，俯视着苏菲，开始用拉丁文向她说话：</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper et in saecula saeculorum. Amen."</p>

<p>"Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper et in saecula saeculorum. Amen."</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Talk sense, silly!" Sophie burst out.</p>

<p>“谁听得懂嘛！呆子！”她忍不住脱口而出。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Her voice resounded all around the old stone church.</p>

<p>她的声音在整座教堂内回响。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Although she realized that the monk had to be Alberto Knox, she regretted her outburst in this venerable place of worship. But she had been nervous, and when you're nervous its comforting to break all taboos.</p>

<p>虽然她确定这个僧侣就是艾伯特，但她还是很后悔自己在如此庄严神圣的地方说出这样不恭敬的话。不过，这都是因为她太紧张的缘故。一个人紧张时，如果能打破一些禁忌就会觉得比较自在些。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Shhh!" Alberto held up one hand as priests do when they want the congregation to be seated.</p>

<p>“嘘！”艾伯特举起一只手，就像神父要群众坐好时所做的动作。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Middle Ages began at four," he said.</p>

<p>“时候到了，中世纪已经开始了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "Middle Ages began at four?" asked Sophie, feeling stupid but no longer nervous. </p>

<p>“中世纪在四点钟开始呀？”苏菲问，觉得自己好蠢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"About four o'clock, yes. And then it was five and six and seven. But it was as if time stood still. And it got to be eight and nine and ten. But it was still the Middle Ages, you see. Time to get up to a new day, you may think. Yes, I see what you mean. But it is still Sunday, one long endless row of Sundays. And it got to be eleven and twelve and thirteen. This was the period we call the High Gothic, when the great cathedrals of Europe were built. And then, some time around fourteen hours, at two in the afternoon, a cock crowed--and the Middle Ages began to ebb away." </p>

<p>“是的，大约在四点钟时，然后是五点、六点、七点。不过时间就就好像静止不动一样。然后时间到了八点、九点与十点，但还是在中世纪。你也许会想，这是一个人起床展开新的一天的时刻。是的，我懂你的意思。不过，现在仍然是星期天，一长串无休无止的星期天。然后，时钟会走到十一点、十二点与十三点。这是我们所称的高歌德(High Gothic)的时期，也是欧洲各大教堂开始兴建的时候。然后，大约在十四点时，有一只公鸡开始啼叫，于是漫长的中世纪就逐渐消逝了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So the Middle Ages lasted for ten hours then," said Sophie.</p>

<p>“这么说中世纪维持了十个小时啰？”苏菲说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> Alberto thrust his head forward out of the brown monk's cowl and surveyed his congregation, which consisted of a fourteen-year-old girl.</p>

<p>艾伯特把头探出棕色僧袍的头罩，打量着他面前的听众(这时只有一个十四岁的女孩而已)。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"If each hour was a hundred years, yes. We can pretend that Jesus was born at midnight. Paul began his missionary journeys just before half past one in the morning and died in Rome a quarter of an hour later. Around three in the morning the Christian church was more or less banned, but by A.D. 313 it was an accepted religion in the Roman Empire. That was in the reign of the Emperor Constantine. The holy emperor himself was first baptized on his deathbed many years later. From the year 380 Christianity was the official religion throughout the entire Roman Empire."</p>

<p>“是的，如果每一个小时代表一百年的话。我们可以假装耶稣是在午夜诞生的，快到凌晨一点半时，保罗开始四处游历传教，一刻钟后死于罗马。在接近凌晨三点时，基督教教会大致上仍遭到禁止，但到了公元后三一三年时，基督教已经被罗马帝国接受。这是在君士坦丁大帝统治的时候。许多年后，这位伟大的君主在临死前受洗成为基督徒。从公元三八O年起，基督教成为罗马帝国的国教。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Didn't the Roman Empire fall? </p>

<p>“罗马帝国最后不是衰亡了吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It was just beginning to crumble. We are standing before one of the greatest changes in the history of culture. Rome in the fourth century was being threatened both by barbarians pressing in from the north and by disintegration from within. In A.D. 330 Constantine the Great moved the capital of the Empire from Rome to Constantinople, the city he had founded at the approach to the Black Sea. Many people considered the new city the "second Rome." In 395 the Roman Empire was divided in two--a Western Empire with Rome as its center, and an Eastern Empire with the new city of Constantinople as its capital. Rome was plundered by bar-barians in 410, and in 476 the whole of the Western Empire was destroyed. The Eastern Empire continued to exist as a state right up until 1453 when the Turks conquered Constantinople."</p>

<p>“这时它才刚开始瓦解而已。这段时期是文化史上变动最大的时期之一。第四世纪时，罗马不但外有北方蛮族进攻的威胁，内部也处于分崩离析的状态。公元三三O午时，君士坦丁大帝将罗马帝国的首都由罗马迁到他在通往黑海之处所兴建的一个城市——君士坦丁堡。许多人把这座新城市当成‘第二个罗马’。三九五年时；罗马帝国一分为二：西方帝国以罗马为中心，东方帝国则以君士坦丁堡为首都。四一O年时，罗马遭蛮族劫掠。到四七六年，整个西方帝国都被摧毁了。东方帝国则继续存在，一直到一四五三年土耳其人征服君士坦丁堡为止。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And its name got changed to Istanbul?"</p>

<p>“那时君士坦丁堡就改名为伊斯坦堡吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's right! Istanbul is its latest name. Another date we should notice is 529. That was the year when the church closed Plato's Academy in Athens. In the same year, the Benedictine order, the first of the great monastic orders, was founded. The year 529 thus became a symbol of the way the Christian Church put the lid on Greek philosophy. From then on, monasteries had the monopoly of education, reflection, and meditation. The clock was ticking toward half past five ……"</p>

<p>“没错！另外一个值得注意的年代是公元五二九年，也就是教会关闭雅典的柏拉图学园那一年。同年，圣本笃修会成立，成为历史上第一个大修会。这一年因此成为基督教会箝制希腊哲学的一个象征。从此以后，修道院垄断了所有的教育与思想。这时，时钟正滴答走向五点半……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie saw what Alberto meant by all these times. Midnight was 0, one o'clock was 100 years after Christ, six o'clock was 600 years after Christ, and 14 hours was 1,400 years after Christ……</p>

<p>苏菲很快便了解艾伯特的意思。午夜是零，一点钟是公元后一百年，六点钟是公元后六百年，十四点钟则是公元后一四00年。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto continued: "The Middle Ages actually means the period between two other epochs. The expression arose during the Renaissance. The Dark Ages, as they were also called, were seen then as one interminable thousand-year-long night which had settled over Europe between antiquity and the Renaissance. The word 'medieval' is used negatively nowadays about anything that is over-authoritative and inflexible. But many historians now consider the Middle Ages to have been a thousand-year period of germination and growth. The school system, for instance, was developed in the Middle Ages. The first convent schools were opened quite early on in the period, and cathedral schools followed in the twelfth century. Around the year 1200 the first universities were founded, and the subjects to be studied were grouped into various 'faculties,' just as they are today."</p>

<p>艾伯特继续说：“中世纪事实上指的是界于两个时代之间的一个时期。这个名词是在文艺复兴时期出现的。另外，这个时期又被称为‘黑暗时代’，因为它是古代与文艺复兴时期之间笼罩欧洲的漫长的‘一千年的夜晚’。如今英文‘medieval’(中世纪)这个字仍被用来指那些过度权威、缺乏弹性的事物，具有贬意。不过，也有些人认为中世纪是是各项体制萌芽成长的时期。例如，学校制度就是在中世纪建立的。历史上第一批修道院学校在中世纪初期成立，教会学校则在十二世纪成立。在公元一二OO年左右，历史上最早的几所大学成立了。当时学校研习的科目也像今天一样分成几个不同的‘学院’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"A thousand years is a really long time."</p>

<p>“一千年真的是很漫长的一段时间。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, but Christianity took time to reach the masses. Moreover, in the course of the Middle Ages the various nation-states established themselves, with cities and citizens, folk music and folktales. What would fairy tales and folk songs have been without the Middle Ages? What would Europe have been, even? A Roman province, perhaps. Yet the resonance in such names as England, France, or Germany is the very same boundless deep we call the Middle Ages. There are many shining fish swimming around in those depths, although we do not always catch sight of them. Snorri lived in the Middle Ages. So did Saint Olaf and Charlemagne, to say nothing of Romeo and Juliet, Joan of Arc, Ivanhoe, the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and many mighty princes and majestic kings, chivalrous knights and fair damsels, anonymous stained-glass window makers and ingenious organ builders. And I haven't even mentioned friars, crusaders, or witches."</p>

<p>“是的，不过基督教也需要这样的一段时间来招揽信徒。此外，许多民族也在这段时间内相继建国，拥有自己的城市、公民、民俗音乐与民俗故事。如果没有中世纪，哪来的这些民俗故事与民俗音乐呢？甚至，没有中世纪，欧洲又会变成什么模样呢？也许仍然会是罗马的一个省份吧！英国、法国或德国这些名词就是在中世纪出现的。在中世纪这个浩瀚汪洋的深处，有许多闪闪发亮的鱼儿游来游去，只是我们不见得都能看到。史特卢森就是中世纪的人，圣欧雪夫(Saint Olaf)与查里曼大帝也是，更不用提罗密欧与朱丽叶、圣女贞德、艾文豪、穿花衣服的吹笛手以及那些强大的王侯与君主、侠义的骑士、美丽的少女、不知名的彩色玻璃工匠与灵巧的管风琴师傅了。再说，我还没提到那些修道士、十字军与女巫哩！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You haven't mentioned the clergy, either."</p>

<p>“你也没提到那些牧师和教士呀！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Correct. Christianity didn't come to Norway, by the way, until the eleventh century. It would be an exaggeration to say that the Nordic countries converted to Christianity at one fell swoop. Ancient heathen beliefs persisted under the surface of Christianity, and many of these pre-Christian elements became integrated with Christianity. In Scandinavian Christmas celebrations, for example, Christian and Old Norse customs are wedded even to this day. And here the old saying applies, that married folk grow to resemble each other. Yuletide cookies, Yuletide piglets, and Yuletide ale begin to resemble the Three Wise Men from the Orient and the manger in Bethlehem. But without doubt, Christianity gradually became the predominant philosophy of life. Therefore we usually speak of the Middle Ages as being a unifying force of Christian culture."</p>

<p>“对。基督教直到十一世纪才来到挪威。如果说北欧马上就信奉了基督教，那是过于夸大其辞了。那时在基督教的表面之下，一些古代异教徒的信仰仍然存在，而这些早期的信仰有许多后来融入了基督教。举例来说，在斯堪地那维亚半岛上，圣诞节的庆典中至今仍可以看到基督教与古代北欧风俗结合的痕迹。俗话说，夫妻结合之后会愈来愈彼此相像。这两种文化结合后也是如此。于是我们看到耶诞饼干、耶诞小猪与耶诞麦酒等风俗，开始愈来愈像东方三智者与伯利恒的马槽。无论如何，基督教逐渐成为北欧人主要的生活哲学。因此我们通常认为中世纪是一股以基督教文化来统一欧洲的力量。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So it wasn't all gloom, then?"</p>

<p>“那么，中世纪也不算太糟啰？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The first centuries after the year 400 really were a cultural decline. The Roman period had been a high culture, with big cities that had sewers, public baths, and libraries, not to mention proud architecture. In the early centuries of the Middle Ages this entire culture crum-bled. So did its trade and economy. In the Middle Ages people returned to payment in kind and bartering. The economy was now characterized by feudalism, which meant that a few powerful nobles owned the land, which the serfs had to toil on in order to live. The population also declined steeply in the first centuries. Rome had over a million inhabitants in antiquity. But by 600, the population of the old Roman capital had fallen to 40,000, a mere fraction of what it had been. Thus a relatively small population was left to wander among what remained of the majestic edifices of the city's former glory. When they needed building materials, there were plenty of ruins to supply them. This is naturally a source of great sorrow to present-day archeologists, who would rather have seen medieval man leave the ancient monuments untouched."</p>

<p>“公元四OO年以后的第一个一百年间确实是一段文化式微的时期。你要知道，在此之前的罗马时期是一个‘高等文化’，有许多大城市，城市里有大型的排水沟、公共澡堂与图书馆等，还有许多宏伟的建筑。然而，到了中世纪最初的几百年间，这整个文化都瓦解了，贸易与经济也崩溃了。中世纪的人们又回到以物易物的交易方式。当时的经济是以‘封建制度’为特色。所谓‘封建制度’就是所有的田产都由少数势力强大的贵族拥有，农奴必须要辛勤耕种才能生活。除此之外，在中世纪最初的数百年间，欧洲人口大量减少。举个例子，在古代时期，罗马的人口繁盛，一度超过一百万，但到了公元六OO年时，却减少到四万人左右，真是天壤之别。当时，这些人生活在这个曾经繁华一时、建筑宏伟的城市中，需要建材时，就从到处可见的废墟中取用。对于现代的考古学家而言，这是很可悲的现象。他们多希望中世纪的人们不曾破坏这些古迹。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's easy to know better after the fact."</p>

<p>“这都是后见之明呀！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"From a political point of view, the Roman period was already over by the end of the fourth century. However, the Bishop of Rome became the supreme head of the Roman Catholic Church. He was given the title 'Pope'--in Latin 'papa,' which means what it says-- and gradually became looked upon as Christ's deputy on earth. Rome was thus the Christian capital throughout most of the medieval period. But as the kings and bishops of the new nation-states became more and more powerful, some of them were bold enough to stand up to the might of the church."</p>

<p>“从政治方面来说，罗马时期在第四世纪末时就结束了。不过，当时罗马主教已经成为罗马天主教教会的最高领袖。他被称为‘教宗’或‘父’，并逐渐被视为基督在世上的代理人。因此，在中世纪的大多数时间里，罗马一直是基督教的首府。不过，当各新兴民族国家的君主与主教势力愈来愈强大时，有些人就开始反抗教会的势力。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You said the church closed Plato's Academy in Athens. Does that mean that all the Greek philosophers were forgotten?"</p>

<p>“你说过教会关闭了雅典的柏拉图学园。那是不是从此以后希腊哲学就统统被遗忘了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Not entirely. Some of the writings of Aristotle and Plato were known. But the old Roman Empire was gradually divided into three different cultures. In Western Europe we had a Latinized Christian culture with Rome as its capital. In Eastern Europe we had a Greek Christian culture with Constantinople as its capital. This city began to be called by its Greek name, Byzantium. We therefore speak of the Byzantine Middle Ages as opposed to the Roman Catholic Middle Ages. </p>

<p>“这倒没有。亚理斯多德与柏拉图的部分著作仍然流传下来，但古罗马帝国却逐渐分裂成三种不同的文化。其中在西欧的是拉丁式的基督文化，以罗马为首都。在东欧则是希腊式的基督文化，以君士坦丁堡为首都。君士坦丁堡后来又改为希腊名‘拜占庭’。因此我们现在一般都将欧洲的中世纪文化分成‘拜占庭的中世纪’与‘罗天主教的中世纪’。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>However, North Africa and the Middle East had also been part of the Roman Empire. This area developed during the Middle Ages into an Arabic-speaking Muslim culture. After the death of Muhammad in 632, both the Middle East and North Africa were won over to Islam. Shortly thereafter, Spain also became part of the world of Islamic culture. Islam adopted Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and Bagdad as holy cities. From the point of view of cultural history, it is interesting to note that the Arabs also took over the ancient Hellenistic city of Alexandria. Thus much of the old Greek science was inherited by the Arabs. All through the Middle Ages, the Arabs were predominant hi sciences such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, and medicine. Nowadays we still use Arabic figures. In a number of areas Arabic culture was superior to Christian culture."</p>

<p>除此之外，北非与中东地区过去也曾是罗马帝国的一部分。这个地区在中世纪期间发展成为讲阿拉伯语的伊斯兰教文化。公元六三二年穆罕默德去世后，中东与北非成了伊斯兰教地区。不久后，西班牙也成为伊斯兰教世界的一部分。伊斯兰教将麦加、麦地那、耶路撒冷与巴格达视为‘圣城’。从文化史的观点来看，还有一件值得注意的事：当时阿拉伯人也占据了古代希罗马地区的城市亚力山卓。因此，古希腊科学文明有一大部分为阿拉伯人所继承。在整个中世纪期间，阿拉伯人在数学、化学、天文学与医学等方面都居于领先的地位。直到今天，我们仍然使用所谓的‘阿拉伯数字’。我们可以说，当时在若干领域中，阿拉伯文化确实是优于基督教文化。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I wanted to know what happened to Greek philosophy."</p>

<p>“我想知道后来希腊哲学怎么了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Can you imagine a broad river that divides for a while into three different streams before it once again becomes one great wide river?"</p>

<p>“你能想象一条大河一下子分成三股支流，过了一段时间后又再度汇集成一条大河吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>“嗯，可以。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Then you can also see how the Greco-Roman culture was divided, but survived through the three cultures: the Roman Catholic in the west, the Byzantine in the east, and the Arabic in the south. Although it's greatly oversimplified, we could say that Neoplatonism was handed down in the west, Plato in the east, and Aristotle to the Arabs in the south. But there was also something of them all in all three streams. The point is that at the end of the Middle Ages, all three streams came together in Northern Italy. The Arabic influence came from the Arabs in Spain, the Greek influence from Greece and the Byzantine Empire. And now we see the beginning of the Renaissance, the 'rebirth' of antique culture. In one sense, antique culture had survived the Dark Ages."</p>

<p>“那么你也应该可以了解希腊罗马文化如何分裂成三种文化，并分别在其中存活。这三种文化分别是：西边的罗马天主教文化、东边的东罗马帝国文化与南边的阿拉伯文化。大致上，我们可以说新柏拉图派哲学在西边承传了下来。柏拉图与亚理斯多德的哲学则分别在东边与南边承传了下来。不过，我们可以说，在这三种文化中，每种成分都各有一些。重要的是，在中世纪末期，这三种文化在意大利北部交会融合。阿拉伯文化的影响力来自于在西班牙的阿拉伯人，希腊文化的影响力来自于希腊和拜占庭帝国。这时，‘文艺复兴时期’(古代文化的‘再生’)就逐渐开始了。从某个角度来看，古代文化在中世纪期间可说并未消亡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>“原来如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But let us not anticipate the course of events. We mast first talk a little about medieval philosophy. I shall not speak from this pulpit any more. I'm coming down."</p>

<p>“不过，我们还是不要先谈这个。我们应该先谈一点中世纪的哲学。我不想继续站在讲坛上说话了，我要下来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie's eyes were heavy from too little sleep. When she saw the strange monk descending from the pulpit of St. Mary's Church, she felt as if she were dreaming.</p>

<p>由于睡得太少，苏菲的眼皮已经渐渐沉重。现在，当她看到这个奇怪的僧侣从圣玛莉教堂的讲坛走下来时，她感觉好像在作梦一般。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto walked toward the altar rail. He looked up at the altar with its ancient crucifix, then he walked slowly toward Sophie. He sat down beside her on the bench of the pew.</p>

<p>艾伯特走向祭坛的栏杆。他先抬起头看着竖着古老的耶稣受难像的祭坛，而后眼光朝下看着苏菲，并慢慢走向她。最后他与她并排坐在木椅上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>It was a strange feeling, being so close to him. Under his cowl Sophie saw a pair of deep brown eyes. They belonged to a middle-aged man with dark hair and a little pointed beard. </p>

<p>苏菲头一遭如此靠近他，感觉很奇特。他的头罩下面是一双深蓝色的眼睛。这双眼睛的主人是一个中年男子，有着黑色的头发，蓄着有点削尖的胡子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Who are you, she wondered. Why have you turned my life upside down?</p>

<p>你到底是谁呢？苏菲心想。你为何要把我的生活弄得秩序大乱？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We shall become better acquainted by and by," he said, as if he had read her thoughts.</p>

<p>“我们将会慢慢彼此了解。”他说，仿佛能够看穿她的心思。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>As they sat there together, with the light that filtered into the church through the stained-glass windows becoming sharper and sharper, Alberto Knox began to talk about medieval philosophy.</p>

<p>当他们坐在一起时，透过彩色玻璃窗照进教堂的光线变得愈来愈强。艾伯特开始谈论中世纪的哲学：</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The medieval philosophers took it almost for granted that Christianity was true," he began. </p>

<p>“中世纪的哲学家几乎认定基督教义就是真理。”他一开始时说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The question was whether we must simply believe the Christian revelation or whether we can approach the Christian truths with the help of reason. What was the relationship between the Greek philosophers and what the Bible said? Was there a contradiction between the Bible and reason, or were belief and knowledge compatible? Almost all medieval philosophy centered on this one question."</p>

<p>“他们的问题在于：我们是否一定要相信基督教的启示？还是我们可以借助理性来探索基督教的真理？希腊哲学家与圣经的记载有何关系？圣经与理性之间有抵触吗？还是信仰与知识是可以相容的？几乎所有的中世纪哲学都围绕在这些问题上打转。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie nodded impatiently. She had been through this in her religion class.</p>

<p>苏菲不耐烦地点点头。她在宗教课考试时已经都谈过这些了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p></p>

<p></p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p></p>

<p>圣奥古斯丁</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We shall see how the two most prominent medieval philosophers dealt with this question, and we might as well begin with St. Augustine, who lived from 354 to 430. In this one person's life we can observe the actual transition from late antiquity to the Early Middle Ages. Augustine was born in the little town of Tagaste in North Africa. At the age of sixteen he went to Carthage to study. Later he traveled to Rome and Milan, and lived the last years of his life in the town of Hippo, a few miles west of Carthage. However, he was not a Christian all his life. Augustine examined several different religions and philosophies before he became a Christian."</p>

<p>“我们将谈一谈最著名的两大中世纪哲学家如何处理这个问题。我们还是从圣奥古斯丁(St．Augustine)开始好了。他生于公元三五四年，死于四三O年。在他的一生中我们可以看到古代末期到中世纪初期的变迁。圣奥古斯丁出生于北非一个名叫塔加斯特(Tagaste)的小镇。十六岁时，他前往迦太基求学。稍后，他转往罗马与米兰，最后在迦太基西边几英里一个名叫西波(Hippo)的小镇度过他的余年。不过，他并非一生都是基督徒。他是在仔细研究各种不同的宗教与哲学后才决定信教。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Could you give some examples?"</p>

<p>“你可以举一些例子吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"For a time he was a Manichaean. The Manichaeans were a religious sect that was extremely characteristic of late antiquity. Their doctrine was half religion and half philosophy, asserting that the world consisted of a dualism of good and evil, light and darkness, spirit and matter. With his spirit, mankind could rise above the world of matter and thus prepare for the salvation of his soul. But this sharp division between good and evil gave the young Augustine no peace of mind. He was completely preoccupied with what we like to call the 'problem of evil.' By this we mean the question of where evil comes from. For a time he was influenced by Stoic philosophy, and according to the Stoics, there was no sharp division between good and evil. However, his principal leanings were toward the other significant philosophy of late antiquity, Neoplatonism. Here he came across the idea that all existence is divine in nature."</p>

<p>“有一段时间他信奉摩尼教。那是古代末期很典型的一个教派，一半是宗教，一半是哲学。他们宣称宇宙由善与恶、光与暗、精神与物质等二元的事物所组成。人类可运用精神来超脱于物质世界之上，并借此为灵魂的救赎做好准备。不过，这种将善与恶一分为二的理论并不能使年轻的圣奥古斯丁完全信服。他全心思考着我们所谓的‘恶的问题’，也就是恶从何而来的问题。有一段时间他受到斯多葛派哲学的影响。斯多葛派认为，善与恶之间并没有明显的分界。然而，大致上奥古斯丁还是比较倾向于古代末期的另一派重要哲学，就是新柏拉图派的哲学。他在其间发现了神圣的大自然整体存在的概念。”</p></div>

<p>"So he became a Neoplatonic bishop?"</p>

<p>“所以他成了一位信奉新柏拉图派哲学的主教？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, you could say that. He became a Christian first, but the Christianity of St. Augustine is largely influenced by Platonic ideas. And therefore, Sophie, therefore you have to understand that there is no dramatic break with Greek philosophy the minute we enter the Christian Middle Ages. Much of Greek philosophy was carried over to the new age through Fathers of the Church like St. Augustine."</p>

<p>“是的，可以这么说。他成为基督徒在先，不过他的基督教理念大部分是受到柏拉图派哲学观的影响。因此，苏菲，你必须了解，并非一进入基督教的中世纪，人们就与希腊哲学完全脱离了关系。希腊哲学有一大部分被像圣奥古斯丁这样的教会领袖带到这个新时代。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Do you mean that St. Augustine was half Christian and half Neoplatonist?"</p>

<p>“你的意思是说圣奥古斯丁一半是基督徒，一半是新柏拉图派的哲学家吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"He himself believed he was a hundred-percent Christian although he saw no real contradiction between Christianity and the philosophy of Plato. For him, the similarity between Plato and the Christian doctrine was so apparent that he thought Plato must have had knowl-edge of the Old Testament. This, of course, is highly improbable. Let us rather say that it was St. Augustine who 'christianized' Plato."</p>

<p>“他认为他自己是百分之百的基督徒，因为他并不以为基督教的教义与柏拉图的哲学之间有所矛盾。对他而言，柏拉图哲学与天主教教义的相似之处是很明显的，以至于他认为柏拉图一定知道旧约的故事。这点当然很不可能。我们不妨说是圣奥古斯丁将柏拉图加以‘基督教化’的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So he didn't turn his back on everything that had to do with philosophy when he started believing in Christianity?"</p>

<p>“这么说，他开始信仰基督教以后，并没有把哲学完全抛到脑后是吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No, but he pointed out that there are limits to how far reason can get you in religious questions. Christianity is a divine mystery that we can only perceive through faith. But if we believe in Christianity, God will 'illuminate' the soul so that we experience a sort of supernatural knowledge of God. St. Augustine had felt within himself that there was a limit to how far philosophy could go. Not before he became a Christian did he find peace in his own soul. 'Our heart is not quiet until it rests in Thee,' he writes."</p>

<p>“是的，但他指出，在宗教问题上理性能做的事有限。基督教是一个神圣的奥秘，我们只能透过信仰来领会。如果我们相信基督，则上帝将会‘照亮’我们的灵魂，使我们能够对上帝有一种神奇的体悟。圣奥古斯丁内心深处一直觉得哲学能做的有限。他的灵魂一直无法获得平静，直到他决定成为基督徒为止。他写道：‘我们的心无法平静，直到在你(天主)怀中安息。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I don't quite understand how Plato's ideas could go together with Christianity," Sophie objected. "What about the eternal ideas?"</p>

<p>“我不太明白柏拉图的哲学怎能与基督教并存，”苏菲有点意见，“那关于永恒的理型又怎么办呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Well, St. Augustine certainly maintains that God created the world out of the void, and that was a Biblical idea. The Greeks preferred the idea that the world had always existed. But St. Augustine believed that before God created the world, the 'ideas' were in the Divine mind. So he located the Platonic ideas in God and in that way preserved the Platonic view of eternal ideas."</p>

<p>“圣奥古斯丁当然认为上帝自虚空中创造了世界，这是圣经中的说法。希腊人则比较相信世界是一向都存在的。不过，圣奥古斯丁相信，在上帝创造世界之前，那些‘理型’乃是存在于神的心中。因此他把柏拉图所说的理型放在上帝的心中，借此保存了柏拉图有关永恒理型的看法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That was smart."</p>

<p>“他很聪明。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But it indicates how not only St. Augustine but many of the other Church Fathers bent over backward to bring Greek and Jewish thought together. In a sense they were of two cultures. Augustine also inclined to Neoplatonism in his view of evil. He believed, like Plotinus, that evil is the 'absence of God.' Evil has no independent existence, it is something that is not, for God's creation is in fact only good. Evil comes from mankind's disobedience, Augustine believed. Or, in his own words, 'The good will is God's work; the evil will is the falling away from God's work.' "</p>

<p>“这显示圣奥古斯丁与其他许多教会领袖是如何努力将希腊与犹太思想融合在一起。就某一方面来说，他们是同时属于两种文化的。在有关恶的问题上，圣奥古斯丁也比较倾向新柏拉图派哲学的看法。他和普罗汀一样相信邪恶是由于‘上帝不在’的结果。邪恶本身并不存在。因为实际上，上帝创造的事物只有好的，没有坏的。圣奥古斯丁认为，邪恶是来自于人类的不服从。或者，用他的话来说：‘善的意念是上帝的事功，恶的意念是远离上帝的事功。，”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Did he also believe that man has a divine soul?"</p>

<p>“他也相信人有一个神圣的灵魂吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes and no. St. Augustine maintained that there is an insurmountable barrier between God and the world. In this he stands firmly on Biblical ground, rejecting the doctrine of Plotinus that everything is one. But he nevertheless emphasizes that man is a spiritual being. He has a material body--which belongs to the physical world which 'moth and rust doth corrupt'--but he also has a soul which can know God."</p>

<p>“可以说是，也可以说不是。圣奥古斯丁主张上帝与世界之间有一道不可跨越的距离。在这方面他坚决支持圣经的说法，反对普罗汀所说‘万物皆为上帝的一部分’的主张。不过他仍然强调人是有灵性的生物。他认为人有一具由物质造成的躯体，这个躯体属于‘可为虫蛾铁锈所腐’的物质世界，但同时人也有灵魂，可以认识上帝。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What happens to the soul when we die?"</p>

<p>“我们死了以后，灵魂会怎样呢？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"According to St. Augustine, the entire human race was lost after the Fall of Man. But God nevertheless decided that certain people should be saved from perdition."</p>

<p>“根据圣奥古斯丁的说法，自从亚当、夏娃被逐出伊甸园后，全人类都迷失了，不过上帝仍然决定要让某些人免于毁灭。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"In that case, God could just as well have decided that everybody should be saved."</p>

<p>“如果是这样，他大可以拯救所有的人呀！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"As far as that goes, St. Augustine denied that man has any right to criticize God, referring to Paul's Epistle to the Romans: 'O Man, who art thou that replies! against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it; why hast thou made me thus? or Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?' "</p>

<p>“就这点来说，圣奥古斯丁否认人有权批评上帝，他引述保罗所写的《罗马书》中的一段句子：‘你这个人哪，你是谁？竟敢向神强嘴呢？受造之物岂能对造他的神说：你为什么这样造我呢？窑匠难道没有权柄，从一团泥里拿一块做成贵重的器皿，又拿一块做成卑贱的器皿吗？’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So God sits up in his Heaven playing with people? And as soon as he is dissatisfied with one of his creations, he just throws it away."</p>

<p>“这么说上帝是高高坐在天堂里，把人类当成玩具，一旦他不满意一件造物，就把它丢掉。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"St. Augustine's point was that no man deserves God's redemption. And yet God has chosen some to be saved from damnation, so for him there was nothing secret about who will be saved and who damned. It is preordained. We are entirely at his mercy."</p>

<p>“圣奥古斯丁的观点是：没有人值得上帝的救赎。然而上帝到底还是决定拯救某些人，使他们免下地狱。因此，对他而言，谁会获救，谁会受罚，并不是秘密。这都是事先注定的。我们完全任凭他处置。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So in a way, he returned to the old belief in fate."</p>

<p>“这样说来，从某个方面来看，他又回归到古老的迷信去了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Perhaps. But St. Augustine did not renounce man's responsibility for his own life. He taught that we must live in awareness of being among the chosen. He did not deny that we have free will. But God has 'foreseen' how we will live."</p>

<p>“也许吧。不过圣奥古斯丁并不认为人类应该放弃对自己生命的责任。他教导众人要有自己，就是少数选民之一的自觉。他并不否认人有自由意志，只不过上帝已经‘预见’我们将如何生活。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Isn't that rather unfair?" asked Sophie. "Socrates said that we all had the same chances because we all had the same common sense. But St. Augustine divides people into two groups. One group gets saved and the other gets damned."</p>

<p>“这不是很不公平吗？”苏菲问。“苏格拉底说我们都有同样的机会，因为我们都有同样的知识。但圣奥古斯丁却把人分成两种，一种会得救，一种会受罚。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You are right in that St. Augustine's theology is considerably removed from the humanism of Athens. But St. Augustine wasn't dividing humanity into two groups. He was merely expounding the Biblical doctrine of salvation and damnation. He explained this in a learned work called the City of God."</p>

<p>“在这方面你说对了。一般认为，圣奥古斯丁的神学脱离了雅典的人本主义。但是，将人类分成两种人的并非圣奥古斯丁。他只是解释圣经中有关救赎与惩罚的教义罢了。他在《上帝之城》(The City of God)这本著作中就这点做了说明。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Tell me about that."</p>

<p>“书里说些什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The expression 'City of God,' or 'Kingdom of God,' comes from the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. St. Augustine believed that all human history is a struggle between the 'Kingdom of God' and the 'Kingdom of the World.' The two 'kingdoms' are not political kingdoms distinct from each other. They struggle for mastery inside every single person. </p>

<p>“‘上帝之城’或‘天国’这个名称来自圣经和耶稣的教诲。圣奥古斯丁相信，一部人类史就是‘天国’与‘世俗之国’之间奋战的历史。这两‘国’并非以政治区分，它们互相争夺对个人的控制权。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Nevertheless, the Kingdom of God is more or less clearly present in the Church, and the Kingdom of the World is present in the State--for example, in the Roman Empire, which was in decline at the time of St. Augustine. This conception became increasingly clear as Church and State fought for supremacy throughout the Middle Ages. There is no salvation outside the Church,' it was now said. St. Augustine's 'City of God' eventually became identical with the es-tablished Church. Not until the Reformation in the sixteenth century was there any protest against the idea that people could only obtain salvation through the Church."</p>

<p>‘天国’或多或少存在于教会中，而‘世俗之国’则存在于各个国家，例如当时已渐趋没落的罗马帝国中，这个观念在中世纪期间变得更加清晰，因为当时教会与各国不断互争主控权。当时有一个说法是：‘除在教会之外，别无救赎。’圣奥古斯丁所说的‘上帝之城’后来成为教会的同义字。一直要到第十六世纪的宗教改革运动，才有人敢驳斥‘人们只能经由教会得救’的观念。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It was about time!"</p>

<p>“的确是应该抗议了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We can also observe that St. Augustine was the first philosopher we have come across to draw history into his philosophy. The struggle between good and evil was by no means new. What was new was that for Augustine the struggle was played out in history. There is not much of Plato in this aspect of St. Augustine's work. He was more influenced by the linear view of history as we meet it in the Old Testament: the idea that God needs all of history in order to realize his Kingdom of God. History is necessary for the enlightenment of man and the de-struction of evil. Or, as St. Augustine put it, 'Divine foresight directs the history of mankind from Adam to the end of time as if it were the story of one man who gradually develops from childhood to old age.' "</p>

<p>“除此之外，圣奥古斯丁也是我们迄今所谈到的第一个将历史纳入哲学理论的哲学家。他所说的善恶之争并无新意，新鲜的是他说这场战争一直在历史上演出。在这方面，圣奥古斯丁的理念并没有太多柏拉图的影子。事实上，对圣奥古斯丁影响较大的是旧约中的线性历史观，也就是‘上帝要借历史来实现天国理想’的说法。圣奥古斯丁认为，为了使人类获得启蒙，也为了摧毁邪恶，历史是有必要存在的。或者，就像圣奥古斯丁所说的；‘神以其先知先觉导引人类的历史，从亚当一直到世界末日。历史就像一个人从童年逐渐成长、衰老的故事。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie looked at her watch. "It's ten o'clock," she said. "I'll have to go soon."</p>

<p>苏菲看了看手表。“已经八点了。”她说。“我很快就得走了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But first I must tell you about the other great medieval philosopher. Shall we sit outside?"</p>

<p>“在此之前，我还要和你谈谈中世纪另外一个大哲学家。我们到外面去坐好吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto stood up. He placed the palms of his hands together and began to stride down the aisle. He looked as if he was praying or meditating deeply on some spiritual truth. Sophie followed him; she felt she had no choice.</p>

<p>艾伯特站起身来，双掌合十，然后便大步沿着侧廊走出去，看来仿佛正在祈祷，或正深思某个关于性灵的真理。苏菲别无选择，只好跟随着他。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The sun had not yet broken through the morning clouds. </p>

<p>教堂外的地上仍然笼罩着一层薄薄的雾气。旭日早已东升，但仍躲在云层中。教堂所在的地区属于旧市区的边缘。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto seated himself on a bench outside the church. Sophie wondered what people would think if anyone came by. Sitting on a church bench at ten in the morning was odd in itself, and sitting with a medieval monk wouldn't make things look any better.</p>

<p>艾伯特在教堂外的一张长椅上坐下来。苏菲心想，如果有人打这儿经过，看见他们，不知道会怎么想呢。早上八点就坐在长椅上已经够奇怪了，再加上身边还有一个中世纪的僧侣，那更是怪上加怪了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It is eight o'clock," he began. "About four hundred years have elapsed since St. Augustine, and now school starts. From now until ten o'clock, convent schools will have the monopoly on education. Between ten and eleven o'clock the first cathedral schools will be founded, followed at noon by the first universities. The great Gothic cathedrals will be built at the same time. This church, too, dates from the 1200s--or what we call the High Gothic period. In this town they couldn't afford a large cathedral."</p>

<p>“已经八点了。”艾伯特开始说。“从圣奥古斯丁的时代到现在已经过了四百年了。现在，学校开始成立了。从现在起到十点钟为止，修道院所办的学校将会垄断所有教育工作。在十点和十一点之间，第—所由教堂创办的学校将会成立。到正午时，最早的几所大学将会出现，几座宏伟的歌德式大教堂也将在此时建成。这座圣玛莉教堂也是在十三世纪(或称‘高歌德时期’)兴建的。这个镇没钱盖大一点的教堂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"They didn't need one," Sophie said. "I hate empty churches."</p>

<p>“他们也不需要太大的教堂啊！”苏菲插嘴。“我讨厌空空荡荡的教堂。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Ah, but the great cathedrals were not built only for large congregations. They were built to the glory of God and were in themselves a kind of religious celebration. However, something else happened during this period which has special significance for philosophers like us."</p>

<p>“可是兴建大教堂并不只是为了供一大群人做礼拜，另外也是为了彰显上帝的荣耀。大教堂本身就是一种宗教庆典。话说回来，这段时期内发生了一件事，对像我们这样的哲学家别具意义。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto continued: "The influence of the Arabs of Spain began to make itself felt. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Arabs had kept the Aristotelian tradition alive, and from the end of the twelfth century, Arab scholars began to arrive in Northern Italy at the invitation of the nobles. Many of Aristotle's writings thus became known and were translated from Greek and Arabic into Latin. This created a new interest in the natural sciences and infused new life into the question of the Christian revelation's relationship to Greek philosophy. Aristotle could obviously no longer be ignored in matters of science, but when should one attend to Aristotle the phi-losopher, and when should one stick to the Bible? Do you see?"</p>

<p>艾伯特继续说：“在这个时期，西班牙的阿拉伯人所带来的影响开始显现。整个中世纪期间，阿拉伯人维系了亚理斯多德的传统。后来，从十二世纪末起，阿拉伯学者陆续在各王公贵族的邀请之下抵达意大利北部。许多亚理斯多德的著作因此传扬开来，并且被人从希腊文与阿拉伯文译成拉丁文。此举使得人们对于自然科学重新燃起兴趣，并为基督教教义与希腊哲学的关系注入了新生命。在科学方面，亚理斯多德的理论此时显然又再度受到重视，但是，在哲学方面，人们何时应该听从亚理斯多德的话，何时又应该谨守圣经的教诲呢？你明白问题所在吗？”</p></div>
<div class="layout">
<p></p>
<p>圣多玛斯</p>
</div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie nodded, and the monk went on: "The greatest and most significant philosopher of this period was St. Thomas Aquinas, who lived from 1225 to 1274. He came from the little town of Aquino, between Rome and Naples, but he also worked as a teacher at the University of Paris. I call him a philosopher but he was just as much a theologian. There was no great difference between philosophy and theology at that time. Briefly, we can say that Aquinas christianized Aristotle in the same way that St. Augustine christianized Plato in early medieval times."</p>

<p>苏菲点点头。艾伯特继续说：“这段时期最伟大、最重要的哲学家是圣多玛斯(Thomas Aquinas)。他生于一二二五到一二七四年间，家住罗马与那不勒斯之间一个名叫阿奎诺(Aquino)的小镇，后来他在巴黎大学教书。我称他为哲学家，但事实上他也是一位神学家。当时，哲学与神学并没有明显的区分。简而言之，我们可以说圣多玛斯将亚理斯多德加以‘基督教化’，就像中世纪初期的圣奥古斯丁将柏拉图‘基督教化’一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Wasn't it rather an odd thing to do, christianizing philosophers who had lived several hundred years before Christ?"</p>

<p>“把活在基督降生前好几百年的哲学家加以基督教化。这不是很奇怪吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You could say so. But by 'christianizing' these two great Greek philosophers, we only mean that they were interpreted and explained in such a way that they were no longer considered a threat to Christian dogma. Aquinas was among those who tried to make Aristotle's philosophy compatible with Christianity. We say that he created the great synthesis between faith and knowledge. He did this by entering the philosophy of Aristotle and taking him at his word."</p>

<p>“你可以这么说。不过，所谓‘基督教化’的意思只是把这两位希腊大哲学家的观念，用一种不至于对基督教教义造成威胁的方式加以诠释。圣多玛斯就是那些试图使亚里斯多德的哲学与基督教教义相容共存的人之一。我们可以说他把信仰与知识巧妙的融合在一起。他采取的方式是进入亚里斯多德的哲学世界，并以他的话来诠释圣经。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I'm sorry, but I had hardly any sleep last night. I'm afraid you'll have to explain it more clearly."</p>

<p>“对不起，我昨晚几乎都没睡，因此恐怕你得讲清楚一些。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Aquinas believed that there need be no conflict between what philosophy or reason teaches us and what the Christian Revelation or faith teaches us. Christendom and philosophy often say the same thing. So we can frequently reason ourselves to the same truths that we can read in the Bible."</p>

<p>“圣多玛斯认为，哲学、理性这两者和基督教的启示与信仰之间并不一定有冲突。基督教的教义和哲学的道理，其实往往是相通的。所以我们透过理性推断的真理时常和圣经上所说的真理相同。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"How come? Can reason tell us that God created the world in six days or that Jesus was the Son of God?"</p>

<p>“怎么会呢？难道我们可以透过理性得知上帝在六天内创造了世界，或耶稣是上帝之子吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"No, those so-called verities of faith are only accessible through belief and the Christian Revelation. But Aquinas believed in the existence of a number of 'natural theological truths.' By that he meant truths that could be reached both through Christian faith and through our innate or natural reason. For example, the truth that there is a God. Aquinas believed that there are two paths to God. One path goes through faith and the Christian Revelation, and the other goes through reason and the senses. Of these two, the path of faith and revelation is certainly the surest, because it is easy to lose one's way by trusting to reason alone. But Aquinas's point was that there need not be any conflict between a philosopher like Aristotle and the Christian doctrine."</p>

<p>“不，这些所谓的‘信仰的事实’只能透过信仰与基督的启示得知。但圣多玛斯认为世间有若干‘自然的神学真理’。所谓‘自然的神学真理’指的是一些既可以透过基督教的信仰，也可以透过我们与生俱来的理性得知的真理，例如‘上帝确实存在’这个真理。圣多玛斯指出，我们可以透过两条途径接近上帝。一条是经由信仰和基督的启示，一条是经由理性和感官。其中，透过信仰和启示这条是比较确实可靠的，因为我们如果光依靠理性的话，会很容易迷失方向。不过他的重点还是在于像亚里斯多德这样的哲学理论和基督教的教义之间并不一定有冲突。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So we can take our choice between believing Aristotle and believing the Bible?"</p>

<p>“这么说我们可以在亚里斯多德的话和圣经这两者当中做一个选择啰？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Not at all. Aristotle goes only part of the way because he didn't know of the Christian revelation. But going only part of the way is not the same as going the wrong way. For example, it is not wrong to say that Athens is in Europe. But neither is it particularly precise. If a book only tells you that Athens is a city in Europe, it would be wise to look it up in a geography book as well. There you would find the whole truth that Athens is the capital of Greece, a small country in southeastern Europe. If you are lucky you might be told a little about the Acropolis as well. Not to mention Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle."</p>

<p>“不，绝不是这样。亚里斯多德的学说只对了一部分，因为他不曾受到基督的启示。可是对了一半并不等于错。举个例子，如果我说雅典位于欧洲，这句话并没有错，但也不算准确。如果一本书只告诉你雅典是欧洲的一个城市，那么你最好查一下地理书。书上会告诉你雅典是欧洲东南部小国希腊的首都。运气好的话，它还会告诉你有关高城的一些事情，还有苏格拉底、柏拉图和亚里斯多德等人的事迹。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But the first bit of information about Athens was true."</p>

<p>“可是那最初有关雅典的资料是正确的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Exactly! Aquinas wanted to prove that there is only one truth. So when Aristotle shows us something our reason tells us is true, it is not in conflict with Christian teaching. We can arrive successfully at one aspect of the truth with the aid of reason and the evidence of our senses. For example, the kind of truths Aristotle refers to when he describes the plant and the animal kingdom. Another aspect of the truth is revealed to us by God through the Bible. But the two aspects of the truth overlap at significant points. There are many questions about which the Bible and reason tell us exactly the same thing."</p>

<p>“没错。圣多玛斯想要证明世间只有一个真理，而亚里斯多德所说的真理并未与基督教教义冲突。他指出，我们可以透过理性的思考与感官的证据推知一部分的真理，例如亚里斯多德对植物与动物王国的叙述。但另外一部分真理则是由上帝透过圣经对我们加以启示。这两方面的真理在一些重要的点上是互相重叠的。事实上，在许多问题上，圣经和理性所告诉我们的事情是一样的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Like there being a God?"</p>

<p>“譬如说上帝确实存在之类的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Exactly. Aristotle's philosophy also presumed the existence of a God--or a formal cause--which sets all natural processes going. But he gives no further description of God. For this we must rely solely on the Bible and the teachings of Jesus."</p>

<p>“一点没错。亚里斯多德的哲学也认定上帝(或‘目的因’)是造成各种自然现象的力量。但是他对上帝并没有进一步的描述，因此，圣多玛斯认为在这方面我们只能仰赖圣经和耶稣的教诲。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Is it so absolutely certain that there is a God?"</p>

<p>“上帝真的确实存在吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It can be disputed, obviously. But even in our day most people will agree that human reason is certainly not capable of disproving the existence of God. Aquinas went further. He believed that he could prove God's existence on the basis of Aristotle's philosophy."</p>

<p>“这当然是一个很值得讨论的问题。但即使在今天，大多数人仍然认为人无法凭理性证明上帝并不存在。圣多玛斯则更进一步指出，他可以用亚里斯多德的哲学来证明天主确实存在。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Not bad!"</p>

<p>“不坏嘛！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"With our reason we can recognize that everything around us must have a 'formal cause,' he believed. God has revealed himself to mankind both through the Bible and through reason. There is thus both a 'theology of faith' and a 'natural theology.' The same is true of the moral aspect. The Bible teaches us how God wants us to live. But God has also given us a conscience which enables us to distinguish between right and wrong on a 'natural' basis. There are thus also 'two paths' to a moral life. We know that it is wrong to harm people even if we haven't read in the Bible that we must 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' Here, too, the surest guide is to follow the Bible's commandment."</p>

<p>“他认为，我们用理性可以体认到我们周遭的事物必然有个‘目的因’。这是因为上帝既透过圣经，也透过理性向人类显现，所以世上既有‘信仰神学’也有‘自然神学’。在道德方面也是如此，圣经教导我们上帝希望人类如何生活，但上帝同时也赋予我们良心，使我们自然而然会分辨是非善恶。因此，我们要过道德的生活，也有两条路可走。即使我们从来没有在圣经上读过‘己所欲者施于人’的道理，我们也知道伤害人是不对的，在这方面，比较可靠的道路仍然是遵守圣经中的十诫。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I think I understand," said Sophie now. "It's almost like how we know there's a thunderstorm, by seeing the lightning and by hearing the thunder."</p>

<p>“我懂了。”苏菲说。“这有点像是我们无论看到闪电或听到雷声，都可以知道有雷雨来临一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's right! We can hear the thunder even if we are blind, and we can see the lightning even if we are deaf. It's best if we can both see and hear, of course. But there is no contradiction between what we see and what we hear. On the contrary--the two impressions reinforce each other."</p>

<p>“对，就是这样。即使我们瞎了，也可以听到雷声，即使我们聋了，也可看见闪电。当然如果我们能同时看到、听到是最好的。可是我们所听到和看到的事物两者之间并不抵触。相反的，这两种印象具有彼此增强的作用。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>“我明白了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Let me add another picture. If you read a novel-- John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, for example ……"</p>

<p>“我可以再举一个例子。如果你读一本小说，例如史坦贝克(John Steinbeck)的《人鼠之间》……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I've read that, actually."</p>

<p>“我真的读过啦。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Don't you feel you know something about the author just by reading his book?"</p>

<p>“你难道不觉得你可以透过这本书了解作者的一些背景吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I realize there is a person who wrote it."</p>

<p>“我知道这本书一定是有人写的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Is that all you know about him?"</p>

<p>“你就只知道这点吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"He seems to care about outsiders."</p>

<p>“你好像很关心弱者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"When you read this book--which is Steinbeck's creation--you get to know something about Steinbeck's nature as well. But you cannot expect to get any personal information about the author. Could you tell from reading Of Mice and Men how old the author was when he wrote it, where he lived, or how many children he had?"</p>

<p>“当你读这本史坦贝克的‘创作’时，应该可以约略了解史坦贝克这个人的性情。可是你无法从书中获取任何有关作者的个人资料。例如，你读了《人鼠之间》这本书后，可以知道作者在写这本书时年纪多大、住在哪里或有多少个孩子吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>“当然不能。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But you can find this information in a biography of John Steinbeck. Only in a biography--or an autobiography--can you get better acquainted with Steinbeck, the person."</p>

<p>“但是你可以在一本史坦贝克的传记里得知这些资料。唯有透过传记(或自传)你才能够更加了解史坦贝克这个人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p> "That's true."</p>

<p>“没错。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's more or less how it is with God's Creation and the Bible. We can recognize that there is a God just by walking around in the natural world. We can easily see that He loves flowers and animals, otherwise He would not have made them. But information about God, the person, is only found in the Bible--or in God's 'autobiography,' if you like."</p>

<p>“这多少就像是上帝的‘创作’与圣经的关系一样。我们只要在大自然中走动便可以体认到世间确实有上帝存在。我们很容易可以看出他喜欢花儿与动物，否则他不会创造它们。但有关上帝的资料，我们只能透过圣经得知。你可以说圣经就是天主的‘自传’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You're good at finding examples."</p>

<p>“你还真会举例子。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Mmmm……"</p>

<p>“嗯……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>For the first time Alberto just sat there thinking-- without answering.</p>

<p>这是第一次艾伯特坐在那儿想事情，没有回答苏菲的话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Does all this have anything to do with Hilde?" Sophie could not help asking.</p>

<p>“这些事情和席德有关吗？”苏菲忍不住问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We don't know whether there is a 'Hilde' at all."</p>

<p>“我们不知道世上是否有‘席德’这个人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But we know someone is planting evidence of her all over the place. Postcards, a silk scarf, a green wallet, a stocking ……"</p>

<p>“可是我们知道有人到处留下与她有关的证据，像明信片、丝巾、绿皮夹、袜子什么的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto nodded. "And it seems as if it is Hilde's father who is deciding how many clues he will plant," he said. "For now, all we know is that someone is sending us a lot of postcards. I wish he would write something about himself too. But we shall return to that later."</p>

<p>艾伯特点点头。“而且到底要留下多少线索似乎是由席德的父亲来决定的。”他说。“到目前为止，我们只知道有一个人寄给我们很多张明信片。我希望他也能够在信上写一些关于他自己的事。不过这点我们待会儿还会谈到。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's a quarter to eleven. I'll have to get home before the end of the Middle Ages."</p>

<p>“已经十点四十五分了。我等不及谈完中世纪就得回家了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I shall just conclude with a few words about how Aquinas adopted Aristotle's philosophy in all the areas where it did not collide with the Church's theology. These included his logic, his theory of knowledge, and not least his natural philosophy. Do you recall, for ex-ample, how Aristotle described the progressive scale of life from plants and animals to humans?"</p>

<p>“我只想再谈一下圣多玛斯如何在各个不与基督教神学抵触的领域内采纳亚里斯多德的哲学。这些领域包括他的逻辑学、知识理论与自然哲学。举个例子，你是否还记得亚里斯多德如何描述从植物到动物到人类的生命层级？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie nodded.</p>

<p>苏菲点点头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Aristotle believed that this scale indicated a God that constituted a sort of maximum of existence. This scheme of things was not difficult to align with Christian theology. According to Aquinas, there was a progressive degree of existence from plants and animals to man, from man to angels, and from angels to God. Man, like animals, has a body and sensory organs, but man also has intelligence which enables him to reason things out.</p>

<p>“亚里斯多德认为，这个生命的层级显示上帝乃是最高的存在。这个理论并不难与基督教的神学取得共识。圣多玛斯认为，万物的存在分成若干渐进的层次。最低的是植物，其次是动物，再其次是人类，再其次是天使，最上面则是上帝。人像动物一样有身体和感官，但也有理性可以思考。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Angels have no such body with sensory organs, which is why they have spontaneous and immediate intelligence. They have no need to 'ponder,' like humans; they have no need to reason out conclusions. They know everything that man can know without having to learn it step by step like us. And since angels have no body, they can never die. They are not everlasting like God, because they were once created by God. But they have no body that they must one day depart from, and so they will never die."</p>

<p>天使既没有身体也没有感官，因此他们具有自发的、直接的智慧。他们不需要像人类一样的‘思索’，也不需要靠推理来获得结论。他们不需要像我们一样逐步学习，就可以拥有人类所有的智慧。而且由于没有身体的缘故，他们也不会死亡。他们虽然无法像上帝一样永远存在(因为他们也是天主的造物)，但由于他们没有一个终有一天必须离开的身躯，因此他们也永远不会死亡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That sounds lovely!"</p>

<p>“这倒挺不错的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But up above the angels, God rules, Sophie. He can see and know everything in one single coherent vision."</p>

<p>“高居天使之上的是掌管世间万物的天主，他可以看见、知道每一件事物。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So he can see us now."</p>

<p>“所以他现在也可以看见我们哼？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Yes, perhaps he can. But not 'now.' For God, time does not exist as it does for us. Our 'now' is not God's 'now.' Because many weeks pass for us, they do not necessarily pass for God."</p>

<p>“是的，也许是这样的，但不是‘现在’。上帝的时间和人类的时间不同；我们的‘现在’不一定是天主的‘现在’，人间的几个星期并不等于天上的几个星期。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's creepy!" Sophie exclaimed. She put her hand over her mouth. Alberto looked down at her, and Sophie continued: "I got another card from Hilde's father yesterday. He wrote something like--even if it takes a week or two for Sophie, that doesn't have to mean it will be that long for us. That's almost the same as what you said about God!"</p>

<p>“真恐怖！”苏菲用手掩住嘴巴。艾伯特俯视着她。她说：“我昨天接到席德的父亲寄来的一张明信片，上面也说什么‘对苏菲来说是一两星期的时间，对我们而言不见得这么长。’这几乎和你说的上帝一样。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie could see a sudden frown flash across Alberto's face beneath the brown cowl.</p>

<p>苏菲看到艾伯特在棕色头罩下面的脸闪过一抹不悦的神色。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"He ought to be ashamed of himself!"</p>

<p>“他真应该觉得惭愧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie didn't quite understand what Alberto meant. He went on: "Unfortunately, Aquinas also adopted Aristotle's view of women. You may perhaps recall that Aristotle thought a woman was more or less an incomplete man. He also thought that children only inherit the father's characteristics, since a woman was passive and receptive while the man was active and creative. According to Aquinas, these views harmonized with the message of the Bible--which, for example, tells us that woman was made out of Adam's rib."</p>

<p>苏菲并不完全了解艾伯特的意思。他继续说：“令人遗憾的是，圣多玛斯也采取了亚里斯多德对于女人的观点。你可能还记得亚里斯多德认为女人是一个不完整的男人。他并认为小孩子只继承父亲的特征，因为妇女是被动的、只能接受的，而男人则是积极的、具有创造力的。圣多玛斯认为这些观点与圣经的话语一致。例如，圣经上就告诉我们女人是由亚当的肋骨所造的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>“胡说八道！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It's interesting to note that the eggs of mammals were not discovered until 1827. It was therefore perhaps not so surprising that people thought it was the man who was the creative and lifegiving force in reproduction. We can moreover note that, according to Aquinas, it is only as nature-being that woman is inferior to man. Woman's soul is equal to man's soul. In Heaven there is complete equality of the sexes because all physical gender differences cease to exist."</p>

<p>“事实上，人类是一直到一八二七年才发现哺乳类有卵子，因此难怪人们会认为男人是生殖过程中创造生命、赋予生命的力量。不过，圣多玛斯认为，女人只有在身体的构造上比不上男人，但在灵魂上则与男人相当。此外，在天堂里，两性是完全平等的，因为在那里所有身体上的性别差异都不存在了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That's cold comfort. Weren't there any women philosophers in the Middle Ages?"</p>

<p>“这点并不让人觉得好过多少。中世纪难道没有女哲学家吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The life of the church in the Middle Ages was heavily dominated by men. But that did not mean that there were no women thinkers. One of them was Hildegard of Bingen……"</p>

<p>“中世纪的教会大部分是男人的天下，不过这并不表示当时没有女思想家。其中一位名叫席德佳(Hildegard of Bingen)…”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie's eyes widened: "Does she have anything to do with Hilde?"</p>

<p>苏菲睁大了眼睛：“她和席德有什么关系吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What a question! Hildegard lived as a nun in the Rhine Valley from 1098 to 1179. In spite of being a woman, she worked as preacher, author, physician, botanist, and naturalist. She is an example of the fact that women were often more practical, more scientific even, in the Middle Ages."</p>

<p>“怎么会问这种问题呢？席德佳是一O九八到一一七九年间一位住在莱茵河谷的修女。她虽然是个女人，却身兼传教士、作家、医生、植物学家与博物学者等几种头衔。通常中世纪的妇女要比男人更实际，甚至可能更有科学头脑，在这方面席德佳也许是一个象征。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But what about Hilde?"</p>

<p>“我问她到底和席德有没有关系？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"It was an ancient Christian and Jewish belief that God was not only a man. He also had a female side, or 'mother nature.' Women, too, are created in God's likeness. In Greek, this female side of God is called Sophia. 'Sophia' or 'Sophie' means wisdom."</p>

<p>“古代的基督徒和犹太人相信上帝不只是个男人而已。他也有女性化——或所谓‘母性’——的一面。他们认为女人也是依照上帝的形象创造的。在希腊文中，上帝女性化的那一面被称为‘苏菲亚’(Sophia)。‘苏菲亚’或‘苏菲’(Sophie)就是智慧的意思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie shook her head resignedly. Why had nobody ever told her that? And why had she never asked?</p>

<p>苏菲无奈的摇摇头。为什么以前没有人告诉她这件事呢？她又为什么从来没问过呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto continued: "Sophia, or God's mother nature, had a certain significance both for Jews and in the Greek Orthodox Church throughout the Middle Ages. In the west she was forgotten. But along comes Hildegard. Sophia appeared to her in a vision, dressed in a golden tunic adorned with costly jewels ……"</p>

<p>艾伯特继续说：“在中世纪期间，上帝的母性对于犹太人和希腊正教的教会而言别具意义，但在西方她则被人们所遗忘。所幸后来席德佳出现了。她宣称她在幻象中看到了苏菲亚，穿着一袭缀满华贵珠宝的金色袍子……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie stood up. Sophia had revealed herself to Hildegard in a vision ……</p>

<p>苏菲从椅子上站了起来。苏菲亚在梦境中向席德佳显灵…</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Maybe I will appear to Hilde."</p>

<p>“也许我也会向席德现身。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She sat down again. For the third time Alberto laid his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>她再度坐了下来。艾伯特第三次把手放在苏菲的肩膀上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"That is something we must look into. But now it is past eleven o'clock. You must go home, and we are approaching a new era. I shall summon you to a meeting on the Renaissance. Hermes will come get you in the garden."</p>

<p>“这事我们必须好好谈一谈，不过现在已经快十一点钟，你得回家了。我们很快就要讲到一个新的纪元。下一次要讲文艺复兴时，我会通知你来。汉密士会到花园去接你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>With that the strange monk rose and began to walk toward the church. Sophie stayed where she was, thinking about Hildegard and Sophia, Hilde and Sophie. Suddenly she jumped up and ran after the monk-robed philosopher, calling:"Was there also an Alberto in the Middle Ages?"</p>

<p>说完了，这位奇怪的僧侣就站了起来，开始向教堂走去。苏菲留在原地，想着有关“席德佳和苏菲亚、席德和苏菲”的事。突然间她跳了起来，追赶穿着僧侣服的艾伯特，在他身后喊道：“中世纪是不是也有一位艾伯特？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Alberto slowed his pace somewhat, turned his head slightly and said, "Aquinas had a famous philosophy teacher called Albert the Great……"</p>

<p>他稍稍减缓了速度，偏了偏头说道：“圣多玛斯有一位著名的哲学老师，名叫大艾勃特(A1bert the Great)……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>With that he bowed his head and disappeared through the door of St. Mary's Church.</p>

<p>说完了，他便颔了颔首，跨进圣玛莉教堂的门，消失无踪了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie was not satisfied with his answer. She followed him into the church. But now it was completely empty. Did he go through the floor?</p>

<p>苏菲对他的回答并不满意。她也紧跟着回到教堂内，然而现在里面却空无一人。难道他钻进地板去了吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Just as she was leaving the church she noticed a picture of the Madonna. She went up to it and studied it closely. Suddenly she discovered a little drop of water under one of the Madonna's eyes. Was it a tear?</p>

<p>她正要离开教堂时，看见一幅圣母像。她走近画像，仔细审视。突然间她发现圣母的一只眼睛下面有一小滴水。那是眼泪吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie rushed out of the church and hurried back to Joanna's.</p>

<p>苏菲冲出教堂，跑回乔安家。</p></div>
