<p>10 The Major's Cabin</p>

<p>10 少校的小木屋</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>……the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes……</p>

<p>……镜中的女孩双眼眨了一眨……</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>It was only a quarter past seven. There was no need to hurry home. Sophie's mother always took it easy on Sundays, so she would probably sleep for another two hours.</p>

<p>时间才七点十五分，没有必要赶回家。苏菲的妈妈在星期日总是过得比较悠闲一些，因此她也许还会再睡个两小时。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Should she go a bit farther into the woods and try to find Alberto Knox? And why had the dog snarled at her so viciously?</p>

<p>她应不应该再深入树林去找艾伯特呢？上次那只狗为何对她叫得这么凶呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie got up and began to walk down the path Hermes had taken. She had the brown envelope with the pages on Plato in her hand. Wherever the path diverged she took the wider one.</p>

<p>苏菲站起身来，开始沿上次汉密士走过的路走去，手里拿着那个装着柏拉图学说的棕色信封。遇到岔路时，她便挑大路走。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Birds were chirping everywhere--in the trees and in the air, in bush and thicket. They were busily occupied with their morning pursuits. They knew no difference between weekdays and Sundays. Who had taught them to do all that? Was there a tiny computer inside each one of them, programming them to do certain things?</p>

<p>到处都可听到鸟儿们轻快的叫声。在林梢、在空中、在荆棘与草丛之中。这些鸟儿正忙于它们的晨间活动。对它们而言，周间与周末并没有分别。是谁教它们如此的呢？难道每一只鸟儿体内都有一架迷你电脑，设定好程式，叫它们做某些特定的事？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The path led up over a little hill, then steeply down between tall pine trees. The woods were so dense now that she could only see a few yards between the trees.</p>

<p>苏菲沿着路走上了一座小山丘，然后走到一个向下的陡坡，两旁都是高大的松树，树林非常浓密，以至于苏菲只能看到树与树枝间几码之处。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Suddenly she caught sight of something glittering between the pine trunks. It must be a little lake. The path went the other way but Sophie picked her way among the trees. Without really knowing why, she let her feet lead her.</p>

<p>突然，她看到树干间有个东西在闪动。那一定是个小湖。路向另外一头延伸，但苏菲却转向树丛间走去。她不由自主地走着，自己也不太明白为什么会这样做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The lake was no bigger than a soccer field. Over on the other side she could see a red-painted cabin in a small clearing surrounded by silver birches. A faint wisp of smoke was rising from the chimney.</p>

<p>这个湖并不比足球场大。在湖的彼岸，一块由银色桦树所围绕的小小空地上，有一栋红色的小屋。屋顶上的烟囱有一道轻烟正袅袅上升。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie went down to the water's edge. It was very muddy in many places, but then she noticed a rowboat. It was drawn halfway out of the water. There was a pair of oars in it.</p>

<p>苏菲走到湖畔。这里有多处泥泞，不过后来她发现了一条小船，船身有一半在水中，里面还有一对桨。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie looked around. Whatever she did, it would be impossible to get around the lake to the red cabin without getting her shoes soaked. She went resolutely over to the boat and pushed it into the water. Then she climbed aboard, set the oars in the rowlocks, and rowed across the lake. The boat soon touched the opposite bank. Sophie went ashore and tried to pull the boat up after her. The bank was much steeper here than the opposite bank had been.</p>

<p>苏菲环顾四周。看来无论她怎么做，都无法在不把鞋子弄湿的情况下，渡湖到小红屋那边。于是，她一咬牙，走到小船那儿，将它推到水中。然后她爬上船，将桨固定在桨架上，开始划过湖面。不一会儿，船便到了对岸。苏菲跨上岸，想把船拖上来。此处的湖岸要比刚才那边陡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She glanced over her shoulder only once before walking up toward the cabin.</p>

<p>她只回头望了一望，便走向小木屋。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She was quite startled at her own boldness. How did she dare do this? She had no idea. It was as if "something" impelled her.</p>

<p>她对自己如此大胆的行径也感到讶异。她怎么敢这样做呢？她也不知道。仿佛有“某种东西”催促她似的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie went up to the door and knocked. She waited a while but nobody answered. She tried the handle cautiously, and the door opened.</p>

<p>苏菲走到小木屋的门前，敲敲门，但等了一会儿并没有人应门。她小心地转了一下门柄，门就开了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Hallo!" she called. "Is anyone at home?"</p>

<p>“嗨!”她喊。“有人在家吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She went in and found herself in a living room. She dared not shut the door behind her.</p>

<p>她走进去，进入一个客厅，但却不敢把门带上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Somebody was obviously living here. Sophie could hear wood crackling in the old stove. Someone had been here very recently.</p>

<p>这里显然有人住。苏菲听到柴火在旧炉子里发出哔哔剥剥的声音，显然不久前还有人在这里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>On a big dining table stood a typewriter, some books, a couple of pencils, and a pile of paper. A smaller table and two chairs stood by the window that overlooked the lake. Apart from that there was very little furniture, although the whole of one wall was lined with book-shelves filled with books. Above a white chest of drawers hung a large round mirror in a heavy brass frame. It looked very old.</p>

<p>客厅里的一张大餐桌上放了一台打字机、几本书、几支铅笔和一沓纸。面湖的窗前有一张较小的桌子和两把椅子。除此之外，屋里很少家具，不过有一整面墙都是书架，上面放满了书。一个白色的五斗柜上方挂了一面圆形的大镜子，外围镶着巨大的铜框，看起来已经是老古董了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>On one of the walls hung two pictures. One was an oil painting of a white house which lay a stone's throw from a little bay with a red boathouse. Between the house and the boathouse was a sloping garden with an apple tree, a few thick bushes, and some rocks. A dense fringe of birch trees framed the garden like a garland. The title of the painting was "Bjerkely."</p>

<p>另外一面墙上挂着两幅画。一幅是油画作品，画里有一个建有红色船坞的小港湾，距港湾不远处有一栋白屋。船库与白屋之间是一个有点坡度的花园，种了一株苹果树、几棵浓密的灌木，此外还有几块岩石。一排浓密的桦树像花环一般围绕着这座花园。画的题名为“柏客来”(Bjerkely)。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Beside that painting hung an old portrait of a man sitting in a chair by a window. He had a book in his lap. This picture also had a little bay with trees and rocks in the background. It looked as though it had been painted several hundred years ago. The title of the picture was "Berkeley." The painter's name was Smibert.</p>

<p>这幅油画旁挂了另一幅古老的肖像画。画的是一个男人坐在窗边的椅子上，怀中放了一本书，背景也是一个有树、有岩石的小港湾。这幅画看来像是几百年前画的，题名是“柏克莱”(Berkeley)。画家的名字叫史密伯特(Smibert)。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Berkeley and Bjerkely. How strange!</p>

<p>“柏克莱”与“柏客来”，苏菲心想，多奇怪呀!</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie continued her investigation. A door led from the living room to a small kitchen. Someone had just done the dishes. Plates and glasses were piled on a tea towel, some of them still glistening with drops of soapy water. There was a tin bowl on the floor with some leftover scraps of food in it. Whoever lived here had a pet, a dog or a cat.</p>

<p>苏菲继续勘查这座小木屋。客厅有一扇门通向一间小厨房。不久前这里刚有人洗过碗，盘子与玻璃杯都堆在一条茶巾上，其中几个碗杯上面还有几滴闪闪发光的肥皂水。地板上有一个锡碗，里面放着一些剩饭剩菜。这房子的主人一定养了狗或猫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie went back to the living room. Another door led to a tiny bedroom. On the floor next to the bed there were a couple of blankets in a thick bundle. Sophie discovered some golden hairs on the blankets. Here was the evidence! Now Sophie knew that the occupants of the cabin were Alberto Knox and Hermes.</p>

<p>苏菲回到客厅。另外一扇门通向一间小小的卧室，里面有一张床，旁边的地板上放着两、三条捆得厚厚的毯子。苏菲在毯子上发现几根金色的毛发。这就是证据了！现在苏菲知道住在这栋小木屋里的就是艾伯特和汉密士。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Back in the living room, Sophie stood in front of the mirror. The glass was matte and scratched, and her reflection correspondingly blurred. Sophie began to make faces at herself like she did at home in the bathroom. Her reflection did exactly the same, which was only to be expected.</p>

<p>再回到客厅后，苏菲站在五斗柜上方的镜子前。镜面已经失去光泽，而且刮痕累累，因此她在镜中的影像也显得模糊不清。苏菲开始对着镜中的自己扮鬼脸，就像她在家中浴室里做的一般。镜中人也一如预期的跟着她的动作做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>But all of a sudden something scary happened. Just once--in the space of a split second--Sophie saw quite clearly that the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes. Sophie started back in fright. If she herself had winked--how could she have seen the other girl wink? And not only that, it seemed as though the other girl had winked at Sophie as if to say: I can see you, Sophie. I am in here, on the other side.</p>

<p>突然间，一件骇人的事发生了。有一刹那，苏菲很清楚地看到镜中的女孩同时眨着双眼。苏菲吓得倒退了一步。如果是她自己同时眨动双眼，那她怎么看到镜中的影像呢？不仅如此，那个女孩眨眼的样子仿佛是在告诉苏菲：“我可以看到你喔!我在这里，在另外一边。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie felt her heart beating, and at the same time she heard a dog barking in the distance. Hermes! She had to get out of here at once. Then she noticed a green wallet on the chest of drawers under the mirror. It contained a hundred-crown note, a fifty, and a school I.D. card. It showed a picture of a girl with fair hair. Under the picture was the girl's name: Hilde Moller Knag ...</p>

<p>苏菲觉得自己的心怦怦地跳着。就在这时候，她听到远处的狗吠声。汉密士来了!她得马上离开这里才行。这时她看到镜子下方的五斗柜上面有一个绿色的皮夹，里面有一张百元大钞、一张五十元的钞票以及一张学生证，上面贴着一张金发女孩的照片，照片下面写着女孩的名字：席德……</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie shivered. Again she heard the dog bark. She had to get out, at once!</p>

<p>苏菲打了一个冷颤。她再次听到狗叫声，她必须马上离开!</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>As she hurried past the table she noticed a white envelope between all the books and the pile of paper. It had one word written on it: SOPHIE.</p>

<p>当她匆匆经过桌旁时，看到那些书与纸堆旁放着一个白色的信封，上面写着两个字：“苏菲”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Before she had time to realize what she was doing, she grabbed the envelope and stuffed it into the brown envelope with the Plato pages. Then she rushed out of the door and slammed it behind her.</p>

<p>在她还没有时间弄清楚自己在做什么以前，她已经一把抓起了那封信，把它塞到装着柏拉图学说的棕色信封里，然后她便冲出大门，把门在身后“砰!”一声关上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The barking was getting closer. But worst of all was that the boat was gone. After a second or two she saw it, adrift halfway across the lake. One of the oars was floating beside it. All because she hadn't been able to pull it completely up on land. She heard the dog barking quite nearby now and saw movements between the trees on the other side of the lake.</p>

<p>狗叫声愈来愈近。但最糟的是小船不见了。一两秒钟后，她才看到它，原来它正在湖心漂浮，一只桨也在船边漂着。这都是因为她那时无力将它拖上岸的缘故。她听到狗叫声已经逼近，同时湖对岸的树林间也有一些动静。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie didn't hesitate any longer. With the big envelope in her hand, she plunged into the bushes behind the cabin. Soon she was having to wade through marshy ground, sinking in several times to well above her ankles. But she had to keep going. She had to get home.</p>

<p>苏菲不再迟疑。手里拿着大信封，她飞奔到小木屋后面的树丛中。不久她就已置身一片潮湿的沼地。当她在草地上跋涉时，好几次不小心踩进比她脚踝还高很多的水洼中。但是她非继续往前走不可。她必须回家……回家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Presently she stumbled onto a path. Was it the path she had taken earlier? She stopped to wring out her dress. And then she began to cry.</p>

<p>不久，她看到了一条路。这是她来时所走的路吗？她停下来把衣服拧干，然后开始哭泣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>How could she have been so stupid? The worst of all was the boat. She couldn't forget the sight of the row-boat with the one oar drifting helplessly on the lake. It was all so embarrassing, so shameful. . .</p>

<p>她怎么会这么笨呢？最糟的是那条船。她忘不了那船还有那只桨在湖上无助地漂浮的景象。真难为情，真是羞死人了……</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The philosophy teacher had probably reached the lake by now. He would need the boat to get home. Sophie felt almost like a criminal. But she hadn't done it on purpose.</p>

<p>她的哲学老师现在可能已经到达湖边了。他必须要坐船才能回到家。苏菲觉得自己几乎像是个罪犯一般，不过她不是故意的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The envelope! That was probably even worse. Why had she taken it? Because her name was on it, of course, so in a way it was hers. But even so, she felt like a thief. And what's more, she had provided the evidence that it was she who had been there.</p>

<p>对了，那封信!这下，事情更糟了。她为什么要拿它呢？当然，是因为信上写着她的名字，因此可以说那封信是她的。但即使如此，她仍然觉得自己像个小偷。更糟的是，她这样做无异留下证据，显示擅闯小屋的不是别人，就是她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie drew the note out of the envelope. It said:</p>

<p>苏菲把那信从信封里抽出来看，上面写着：</p></div>

<div class="lettle">
<div class='layout'>

<p>What came first--the chicken or the "idea" chicken ?</p>

<p>鸡与鸡的观念何者先有？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Are we born with innate "ideas"?</p>

<p>人是否生来就有一些概念？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>What is the difference between a plant, an animal, and a human? </p>

<p>植物、动物与人类的差别在哪里？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Why does it rain? </p>

<p>天为何会下雨？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>What does it take to live a good life?</p>

<p>人需要什么才能过好的生活？</p></div>

</div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie couldn't possibly think about these questions right now, but she assumed they had something to do with the next philosopher. Wasn't he called Aristotle?</p>

<p>苏菲现在没法思考这些问题。不过她想它们大概与下一位要讨论的哲学家有关。他不是叫亚理斯多德吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>When she finally saw the hedge after running so far through the woods it was like swimming ashore after a shipwreck. The hedge looked funny from the other side.</p>

<p>苏菲在树林间跑了很久。当她终于看到家附近的树篱时，感觉就好像发生船难后游泳上岸的人一般。从这个方向看过去，那排树篱显得很滑稽。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She didn't look at her watch until she had crawled into the den. It was ten-thirty. She put the big envelope into the biscuit tin with the other papers and stuffed the note with the new questions down her tights.</p>

<p>她爬进密洞后，看了看腕表，已经十点半了。她把大信封放进饼干盒里，并把那张写着新问题的纸条塞进她贴身衬衣内。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Her mother was on the telephone when she came in. When she saw Sophie she hung up quickly.</p>

<p>她进门时，妈妈正在打电话。她一看到苏菲，马上挂掉电话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Where on earth have you been?"</p>

<p>“你到底到哪里去了？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I... went for a walk ... in the woods," she stammered.</p>

<p>“我……我去……树林里散步。”她舌头有点打结。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"So I see."</p>

<p>“原来如此。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie stood silently, watching the water dripping from her dress.</p>

<p>苏菲静静地站着，看着水滴从她的衣服上滴下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I called Joanna..."</p>

<p>“我打电话给乔安……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Joanna?"</p>

<p>“乔安？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Her mother brought her some dry clothes. Sophie only just managed to hide the philosopher's note. Then they sat together in the kitchen, and her mother made some hot chocolate.</p>

<p>妈妈拿了几条干布来。苏菲差一点藏不住哲学家的纸条。然后她们母女两个一起坐在厨房里，妈妈泡了一杯热巧克力给苏菲喝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Were you with him?" she asked after a while.</p>

<p>过了一会儿后，妈妈问道；“你刚才是跟他在一起吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Him?"</p>

<p>“他？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie could only think about her philosophy teacher.</p>

<p>苏菲的脑海里想的只有她的哲学老师。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"With him, yes. Him.... your rabbit!"</p>

<p>“对，他……那个跟你谈兔子的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie shook her head.</p>

<p>她摇摇头。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What do you do when you're together, Sophie? Why are you so wet?"</p>

<p>“苏菲，你们在一起时都做些什么？为什么你会把衣服弄得这么湿？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie sat staring gravely at the table. But deep down inside she was laughing. Poor Mom, now she had that to worry about.</p>

<p>苏菲坐在那儿，神情严肃地看着桌子，心里却在暗笑。可怜的妈妈，她现在还得操心“那档子事”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She shook her head again. Then more questions came raining down on her.</p>

<p>她再度摇摇头。然后妈妈又连珠炮似的问了她一堆问题。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Now I want the truth. Were you out all night? Why did you go to bed with your clothes on? Did you sneak out as soon as I had gone to bed? You're only fourteen, Sophie. I demand to know who you are seeing!"</p>

<p>“现在你要说实话。你是不是整晚都在外面？那天晚上你为什么没换衣服就睡了？你是不是一等我上床就偷跑出去了？苏菲，你才十四岁。我要你告诉我你到底和什么人交朋友!”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie started to cry. Then she talked. She was still frightened, and when you are frightened you usually talk.</p>

<p>苏菲哭了起来，然后她便开始说话。因为她心里还是很害怕，而当一个人害怕时，通常会想要说些话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She explained that she had woken up very early and had gone for a walk in the woods. She told her mother about the cabin and the boat, and about the mysterious mirror. But she mentioned nothing about the secret correspondence course. Neither did she mention the green wallet. She didn't quite know why, but she had to keep Hilde for herself.</p>

<p>她向妈妈解释：她今天早上起得很早，于是便去森林里散步。她告诉妈妈有关那小木屋与船，还有那面神秘镜子的事情，但她没有提到她所上的秘密函授课程。也没有提到那只绿色的皮夹。她也不知道为什么，不过她觉得她“不能”把有关席德的事说出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Her mother put her arms around Sophie, and Sophie knew that her mother believed her now.</p>

<p>妈妈用手抱着苏菲，因此苏菲知道妈妈相信她了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"I don't have a boyfriend," Sophie sniffed. "It was just something I said because you were so upset about the white rabbit."</p>

<p>“我没有男朋友。”苏菲啜泣说，“那是我编的，因为那时候我说白兔的事情让你不高兴。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"And you really went all the way to the major's cabin ..." said her mother thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“你真的一路走到少校的小木屋去……”妈妈若有所思地说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The major's cabin?" Sophie stared at her mother.</p>

<p>“少校的小木屋？”苏菲睁大了眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"The little woodland cabin is called the major's cabin because some years ago an army major lived there for a time. He was rather eccentric, a little crazy, I think. But never mind that. Since then the cabin has been unoccupied."</p>

<p>“那栋小木屋叫少校的小木屋，因为多年前有一位老少校住在那儿。他性情很古怪，我想他大概有点疯狂吧。不过，别管这个了。后来，小屋就一直空着。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"But it isn't! There's a philosopher living there now."</p>

<p>“不，现在有一个哲学家住在那里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Oh stop, don't start fantasizing again!"</p>

<p>“得了，苏菲，别再幻想了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie stayed in her room, thinking about what had happened. Her head felt like a roaring circus full of lumbering elephants, silly clowns, daring trapeze flyers, and trained monkeys. But one image recurred unceasingly-- a small rowboat with one oar drifting in a lake deep in the woods--and someone needing the boat to get home.</p>

<p>苏菲待在房间内，心里想着这段时间发生的事。她的脑袋像一个满是大象、滑稽小丑、大胆空中飞人与训练有素的猴子闹哄哄的马戏团。不过有一个影像一直在她脑海里挥之不去，那就是一艘只有一只桨的小舟在林间深处的湖面上漂浮，而湖岸上有一个人正需要划船回家的情景。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She felt sure that the philosophy teacher didn't wish her any harm, and would certainly forgive her if he knew she had been to his cabin. But she had broken an agreement. That was all the thanks he got for taking on her philosophic education. How could she make up for it? </p>

<p>苏菲可以肯定她的哲学老师不会愿意见她受伤，同时，即使他知道她到过他的小木屋，也一定会原谅她的。但是她打破了他们之间的协议。这就是他为她上哲学课所得的报酬吗？她要怎样才能弥补呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie took out her pink notepaper and began to write:</p>

<p>苏菲拿出粉红色的笔记纸，开始写信：</p></div>
<div class="lettle">
<div class='layout'>

<p style="text-indent:0em">Dear Philosopher, </p>

<p style="text-indent:0em">亲爱的哲学家：</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>It was me who was in your cabin early Sunday morning. I wanted so much to meet you and discuss some of the philosophic problems. For the moment I am a Plato fan, but I am not so sure he was right about ideas or pattern pictures existing in another reality. Of course they exist in our souls, but I think--for the moment anyway-- that this is a different thing. I have to admit too that I am not altogether convinced of the immortality of the soul. Personally, I have no recollections from my former lives. If you could convince me that my deceased grandmother's soul is happy in the world of ideas, I would be most grateful.</p>

<p>星期天清晨闯进你的小屋的人就是我。因为我很想见到你，和你讨论一些哲学问题。现在我成了柏拉图迷，不过我不太确定他所说的存在于另外一个世界的观念或形式的说法是否正确。当然这些东西存在于我们的灵魂中，但我认为——至少现在如此——这是两回事。同时我必须承认，我还是不太相信灵魂是不朽的。就我个人来说，我不记得前生的事。如果你能够让我相信我奶奶死后的灵魂正在观念世界里过得很快乐，我会很感谢你。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Actually, it was not for philosophic reasons that I started to write this letter (which I shall put in a pink envelope with a lump of sugar). I just wanted to say I was sorry for being disobedient. I tried to pull the boat completely up on shore but I was obviously not strong enough. Or perhaps a big wave dragged the boat out again.</p>

<p>事实上，我最初写这封信(我会把它和一块糖一起放在一个粉红色的信封里)并不是为了有关哲学的问题。我只是想告诉你我很抱歉没有遵守你的规定。我曾想办法把船拉上岸，但显然我的力气不够大，或者可能是一个大浪把船打走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>I hope you managed to get home without getting your feet wet. If not, it might comfort you to know that I got soaked and will probably have a terrible cold. But that'll be my own fault.</p>

<p>我希望你已经设法回到家，而且没有把脚弄湿。但就算你把脚弄湿了，你也可以稍感安慰，因为我自己也弄得湿淋淋的，而且可能还会得重感冒。当然啦，我是自作自受。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>I didn't touch anything in the cabin, but I am sorry to say that I couldn't resist the temptation to take the envelope that was on the table. It wasn't because I wanted to steal anything, but as my name was on it, I thought in my confusion that it belonged to me. I am really and truly sorry, and I promise never to disappoint you again.</p>

<p>我没有碰小屋里的任何东西，不过很惭愧的是，我受不了诱惑，拿走了放在桌上的那封信。我并不是想偷东西，只是因为信封上写着我的名字，所以我在一时糊涂之下，便以为那是属于我的。我真的很抱歉，我答应以后绝不会再让你失望了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>P.S. I will think all the new questions through very carefully, starting now.</p>

<p>P.S:从现在开始，我会把所有的新问题很仔细地想过一遍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>P.P.S: Is the mirror with the brass frame above the white chest of drawers an ordinary mirror or a magic mirror? I'm only asking because I am not used to seeing my own reflection wink with both eyes.</p>

<p>P.P.S：白色的五斗柜上那面镶铜框的镜子是普通的镜子还是魔镜？我之所以这样问，是因为我不怎么习惯看到自己在镜中的影像同时眨着两只眼睛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>With regards from your sincerely interested pupil, SOPHIE</p>

<p>敬祝安好，学生苏菲敬上</p></div>
</div>



<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie read the letter through twice before she put it in the envelope. She thought it was less formal than the previous letter she had written. Before she went downstairs to the kitchen to get a lump of sugar she looked at the note with the day's questions:</p>

<p>苏菲把信念了两遍，才装进信封。她觉得这次的信不像上一封那么正式。在下楼到厨房拿糖之前，她特地再看了一下纸条上的问题：</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What came first--the chicken or the "idea" chicken?</p>

<p>“鸡和鸡的观念，是何者先有？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>This question was just as tricky as the old riddle of the chicken and the egg. There would be no chicken without the egg, and no egg without the chicken. Was it really just as complicated to figure out whether the chicken or the "idea" chicken came first? Sophie understood what Plato meant. He meant that the "idea" chicken had existed in the world of ideas long before chickens existed in the sensory world. According to Plato, the soul had "seen" the "idea" chicken before it took up residence in a body. But wasn't this just where Sophie thought Plato must be mistaken? How could a person who had never seen a live chicken or a picture of a chicken ever have any "idea" of a chicken? Which brought her to the next question:</p>

<p>这个问题就像“鸡生蛋还是蛋生鸡”这个老问题一样难以回答。没有蛋就没有鸡，但没有鸡也无从有蛋。“先有鸡还是先有蛋’这个观念”这个问题真的一样复杂吗？苏菲了解柏拉图的意思。他是说早在感官世界出现鸡以前，“鸡”这个观念已经存在于观念世界多时了。根据柏拉图的说法，灵魂在寄宿于人体之前已经“见过“观念鸡”。不过这就是苏菲认为柏拉图可能讲错的地方。一个从来没有看过一只活生生的鸡，也从来没有看过鸡的图片的人怎么可能会有任何有关鸡的“观念”呢。这又让她想到下一个问题：</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Are we born with innate "ideas"? Most unlikely, thought Sophie. </p>

<p>“人是否生来就有一些观念呢？”苏菲认为，这是不太可能的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>She could hardly imagine a newborn baby being especially well equipped with ideas. One could obviously never be sure, because the fact that the baby had no language did not necessarily mean that it had no ideas in its head. But surely we have to see things in the world before we can know anything about them.</p>

<p>她很难想象一个初生的婴儿有很多自己的想法。当然，这点我们无法确定，因为婴儿虽不会讲话，也并不一定意味着他的脑袋里没有任何想法。不过我们一定要先看到世间之物，才能对这些事物有所了解吧!</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"What is the difference between a plant, an animal, and a human?" Sophie could immediately see very clear differences.</p>

<p>“植物、动物与人类之间有何区别？”答案太明显了，苏菲可以立即指出来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>For instance, she did not think a plant had a very complicated emotional life. Who had ever heard of a bluebell with a broken heart? A plant grows, takes nourishment, and produces seeds so that it can reproduce itself. That's about all one could say about plants. Sophie concluded that everything that applied to plants also applied to animals and humans. But animals had other attributes as well. They could move, for example. (When did a rose ever run a marathon?) It was a bit harder to point to any differences between animals and humans. Humans could think, but couldn't animals do so as well? Sophie was convinced that her cat Sherekan could think. At least, it could be very calculating. But could it reflect on philosophical questions? Could a cat speculate about the difference between a plant, an animal, and a human? Hardly! A cat could probably be either contented or unhappy, but did it ever ask itself if there was a God or whether it had an immortal soul? Sophie thought that was extremely doubtful. But the same problem was raised here as with the baby and the innate ideas. It was just as difficult to talk to a cat about such questions as it would be to discuss them with a baby.</p>

<p>例如，她认为植物没有复杂的感情生活。谁听过风铃草伤心欲碎？植物生长、吸收养分，然后制造种子以繁衍下一代。除此之外，就没有什么了。苏菲的结论是：植物所有的，动物与人类也都有，但动物还有其他的特色。例如，动物可以移动，(谁听说过一株玫瑰可以跑六十公尺？)至于动物与人类之间的区别就比较难说了。人类能够思考，动物也会吗？苏菲相信她的猫咪雪儿懂得如何思考。至少它很会为自己打算，但是它会思索哲学问题吗？一只猫会去思考植物、动物与人类之间的差异吗？这是不太可能的。一只猫可能很快乐，也可能不快乐，但它会问自己“世间有没有上帝”或“猫儿有没有不朽的灵魂”这类问题吗？苏菲认为这是非常令人怀疑的。不过，话说回来，这个问题就像婴儿有没有自己的想法一样难以回答。就像我们很难和婴儿讨论这类问题一样，我们也很难跟一只猫谈这些问题。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Why does it rain?" Sophie shrugged her shoulders. It probably rains because seawater evaporates and the clouds condense into raindrops. Hadn't she learnt that in the third grade? Of course, one could always say that it rains so that plants and animals can grow. But was that true? Had a shower any actual purpose?</p>

<p>“天为何会下雨？”苏菲耸了耸肩膀。下雨是因为海水蒸发，云层凝聚成雨滴的缘故。这个道理她不是三年级就学过了吗？当然，我们也可以说天之所以下雨是为了要让植物、动物能够生长。但这是真的吗？天空下雨真的有任何目的吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The last question definitely had something to do with purpose: "What does it take to live a good life?"</p>

<p>无论如何，最后一个问题至少与目的有关：“人需要什么才能过好的生活？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>The philosopher had written something about this quite early on in the course. Everybody needs food, warmth, love, and care. Such basics were the primary condition for a good life, at any rate. Then he had pointed out that people also needed to find answers to certain philosophical questions. It was probably also quite important to have a job you liked. If you hated traffic, for instance, you would not be very happy as a taxi driver. And if you hated doing homework it would probably be a bad idea to become a teacher. Sophie loved animals and wanted to be a vet. But in any case she didn't think it was necessary to win a million in the lottery to live a good life. Quite the opposite, more likely. There was a saying: The devil finds work for idle hands.</p>

<p>哲学家在课程开始不久时曾经谈过这个问题。每一个人都需要食物、温暖、爱与关怀。这类事物是良好生活的基本条件。接着哲学家指出，人们也需要为一些哲学问题寻找答案。除此之外，拥有一份自己喜欢的工作可能也是很重要的。举例来说，如果你讨厌塞车，那么你要是当个计程车司机绝对不会快乐。如果你不喜欢做作业，那么你也许不太适合当老师。苏菲喜欢动物，想当兽医。不过，无论如何，她不认为人一定要中百万大奖才能过得好。事实上很可能正好相反。不是有句俗话说“游手好闲，易生祸端”吗？</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie stayed in her room until her mother called her down to a big midday meal. She had prepared sirloin steak and baked potatoes. There were cloudberries and cream for dessert.</p>

<p>苏菲一直待在房间内，直到妈妈叫她下楼吃晚饭为止。妈妈煮了沙朗牛排与烤马铃薯。真棒!餐桌上点了蜡烛，饭后还有奶油草莓当甜点。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>They talked about all kinds of things. Sophie's mother asked her how she wanted to celebrate her fifteenth birthday. It was only a few weeks away.</p>

<p>吃饭时，母女俩谈天说地。妈妈问苏菲想如何庆祝自己的十五岁生日。再过几个礼拜苏菲的生日就到了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>Sophie shrugged.</p>

<p>苏菲耸了耸肩。</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Aren't you going to invite anyone? I mean, don't you want to have a party?"</p>

<p>“你不想请别人到家里来吗？我的意思是，你不想开个宴会吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>“也许。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"We could ask Martha and Anne Marie ... and Helen. And Joanna, of course. And Jeremy, perhaps. But that's for you to decide. I remember my own fifteenth birthday so clearly, you know. It doesn't seem all that long ago. I felt I was already quite grown up. Isn't it odd, Sophie! I don't feel I have changed at all since then."</p>

<p>“我们可以请玛莎和安玛丽来……还有海姬，当然啦，还有乔安，说不定还可以请杰瑞米。不过这得由你自己决定。你知道吗？ 我还很清楚的记得我自己过十五岁生日的情景。感觉上好像才没过多久。当时我觉得自己已经很大了。这不是很奇怪吗？苏菲。我觉得从那以后，自己好像一点都没变。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"You haven't. Nothing changes. You have just developed, gotten older..."</p>

<p>“你没变啊。什么事情都没有改变。你只是不断成长，一年比一年大罢了……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'>

<p>"Mm ... that was a very grownup thing to say. I just think it's all happened so very quickly."</p>

<p>“嗯……你说话已经有大人的口气了。我只是认为一切都发生得太快了，快得让人害怕。”</p></div>
