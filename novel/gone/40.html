  <div class="left">SCARLETT SLEPT little that night. When the dawn had come and the sun was creeping over the black pines on the hills to the east, she rose from her tumbled bed and, seating herself on a stool by the window, laid her tired head on her arm and looked out over the barn yard and orchard of Tara toward the cotton fields. Everything was fresh and dewy and silent and green and the sight of the cotton fields brought a measure of balm and comfort to her sore heart. Tara, at sunrise, looked loved, well tended and at peace, for all that its master lay dead. The squatty log chicken house was clay daubed against rats weasels and clean with whitewash, and so was the log stable. The garden with its rows of corn, bright-yellow squash, butter beans and turnips was well weeded and neatly fenced with split-oak rails. The orchard was cleared of underbrush and only daisies grew beneath the long rows of trees. The sun picked out with faint glistening the apples and the furred pink peaches half hidden in the green leaves. Beyond lay the curving rows of cotton, still and green under the gold of the new sky. The ducks and chickens were waddling and strutting off toward the fields, for under the bushes in the soft plowed earth were found the choicest worms and slugs.</div>
  <div class="right">这一夜，思嘉翻来覆去睡不着。天亮以后，太阳从东边小山上的青松后面升起，她从破床上起身，坐在窗口一张凳子上，用一只胳臂支着沉甸甸的头，朝窗外看去，看见了打谷场，果园，还有远处的棉花地。一切都是那么清新、湿润、宁静，碧绿。她一看见那棉花地，痛苦的心就感到一定的安慰。虽然塔拉的主人已经故去，在清早看得出这地方是有人维护的，是有个精心照料的，是宁静的。矮矮的木鸡舍外面糊着一层泥，免得让耗子和鼬鼠钻进去，而且用白粉刷得干干净净，用森砂盖的马厩也是这样。园子里束平地种着一行行的玉米，又黄又亮的南瓜、豆子、萝卜，没有丁点儿杂草，四周是橡树枝条做成的篱笆，显得整整齐齐。果园里没有杂乱的树丛，一行行果树下面只有雏菊在生长。绿叶遮掩下的苹果和长满绒毛的粉红桃子，在闪烁的阳光下看得格外清晰。再朝远处看，弯曲成行的棉花在清晨金色的天空下呈现出一片绿色，纹丝不动，成群的鸡鸭正优闲的漫步向田里走去。因为在那新耕的土地里可以找到最美味的虫子和蜓蚰。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett’s heart swelled with affection and gratitude to Will who had done all of this. Even her loyalty to Ashley could not make her believe he had been responsible for much of this well-being, for Tara’s bloom was not the work of a planter-aristocrat, but of the plodding, tireless “small farmer” who loved his land. It was a “two-horse” farm, not the lordly plantation of other days with pastures full of mules and fine horses and cotton and corn stretching as far as eye could see. But what there was of it was good and the acres that were lying fallow could be reclaimed when times grew better, and they would be the more fertile for their rest.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉明白这一切都要归功于威尔，因而心里充满了殷切的感激之情。她虽然对艾希礼是一片忠心，也不认为艾希礼为这兴旺景象作了多少贡献，因为塔拉的兴旺绝不是靠一位种田的贵族，而是靠一个热爱土地的"小农"的辛勤劳动。目前农场只有两骑马，远没有昔日那种气派。当年草场上到处骡子、骏马，棉花地和玉米地一眼望不到边。不过现在有的这一部分也还是不错的，那大片荒凉土地等将来日子好了还可以开垦嘛，休耕一段时间，还会更肥沃呢。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Will had done more than merely farm a few acres. He had kept sternly at bay those two enemies of Georgia planters, the seedling pine and the blackberry brambles. They had not stealthily taken garden and pasture and cotton field and lawn and reared themselves insolently by the porches of Tara, as they were doing on numberless plantations throughout the state.</div>
  <div class="right">要说威尔干的话，还不仅限于种了几英亩地，他制服了佐治亚州种田人的两个死敌：靠种子繁殖的松树和一蓬蓬杂乱的黑莓。他们没有能悄悄地侵入花园、牧尝棉田、草地，也没有在门廓附近肆意滋生。佐治亚州有无数农场，却很少见到这种情况。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett’s heart failed a beat when she thought how close Tara had come to going back to wilderness. Between herself and Will, they had done a good job. They had held off the Yankees, the Carpetbaggers and the encroachments of Nature. And, best of all, Will had told her that after the cotton came in in the fall, she need send no more money—unless some other Carpetbagger coveted Tara and skyrocketed the taxes. Scarlett knew Will would have a hard pull without her help but she admired and respected his independence. As long as he was in the position of hired help he would take her money, but now that he was to become her brother-in-law and the man of the house, he intended to stand on his own efforts. Yes, Will was something the Lord had provided.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉想到塔拉几乎变成一片荒野，心里感到一阵后怕。幸亏她和威尔两个人干得不错。他们顶住了北方佬的侵犯，也阻挡住了大自然的掠夺。最使她感到欣慰的是威尔已经告诉她，等到秋天棉花收进来以后，她就可以不再寄钱了，除非贪婪的北方佬看上了塔拉，非要课以重税不可。她知道，要是没有她的帮助，威尔的日子会是非常艰难的，但她佩服而且敬重他那种独立的精神。过去他的身份是雇工，思嘉给的钱他都是接受的，可是现在他就要当思嘉的妹夫了，要当一家之主了，他就想靠自己努力了。确实可以说，威尔是上帝为她安排的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Pork had dug the grave the night before, close by Ellen’s grave, and he stood, spade in hand, behind the moist red clay he was soon to shovel back in place. Scarlett stood behind him in the patchy shade of a gnarled low-limbed cedar, the hot sun of the June morning dappling her, and tried to keep her eyes away from the red trench in front of her. Jim Tarleton, little Hugh Munroe, Alex Fontaine and old man McRae’s youngest grandson came slowly and awkwardly down the path from the house bearing Gerald’s coffin on two lengths of split oak. Behind them, at a respectful distance, followed a large straggling crowd of neighbors and friends, shabbily dressed, silent. As they came down the sunny path through the garden, Pork bowed his head upon the top of the spade handle and cried; and Scarlett saw with incurious surprise that the kinks on his head, so jettily black when she went to Atlanta a few months before, were now grizzled.</div>
  <div class="right">头一天晚上，波克就把墓穴挖好了，紧挨着爱伦的墓。此时他手执铁锹，站在湿润的红土后面，等着过一会儿把土铲回去。思嘉站在他的身后，躲在一棵矮小的疙里疙瘩的雪松下面一小片树荫里。六月的清晨，赤热的归光洒在她身上，呈现出无数的斑点。她两眼望着别处，尽量不看面前那红土墓穴。吉母.塔尔顿，小休.芒罗、亚历克斯.方丹和麦克雷老头儿最小的孙子，他们四个人用两块木板抬着杰拉尔德的棺木从房子里走出来，沿着小路歪歪斜斜地慢慢走来，后面，隔着一段适当的距离，跟着一大群邻居和朋友，穿着破破烂烂的衣服，默默地往前走，当他们来到花园里充满阳光的小路上的时候，波克把头靠在铁锹把顶上，哭起来。思嘉看到波克的头发，几个月前她去亚特兰大时还是乌黑发亮的，现在却已一片花白了，心里不禁感到惊讶。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She thanked God tiredly that she had cried all her tears the night before, so now she could stand erect and dry eyed. The sound of Suellen’s tears, put back of her shoulder, irritated her unbearably and she had to clench her fists to keep from turning and slapping the swollen face. Sue had been the cause of her father’s death, whether she intended it or not, and she should have the decency to control herself in front of the hostile neighbors. Not a single person had spoken to her that morning or given her one look of sympathy. They had kissed Scarlett quietly, shaken her hand, murmured kind words to Carreen and even to Pork but had looked through Suellen as if she were not there.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉觉得有些疲倦。她托上帝的福，昨天晚上就把眼泪哭干了，所以现在她能站在那里，眼睛干干的。苏伦在她身后掉眼泪，这哭声使她无法忍受，要不是攥紧了拳头，真会转身在那发肿的脸上给她一耳光。不管是有意还是无意，父亲的死是苏伦造成的，照理说，在对她不满的众位邻居面前，她应该克制自己的感情。那天清晨，没有一个人和她说话，也没有人向她投以同情的目光。大家都默默地与思嘉亲吻，与握手，悄悄地对卡琳甚至对波克说些安慰的话，看见苏伦，却像没这么个人似的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">To them she had done worse than murder her father. She had tried to betray him into disloyalty to the South. And to that grim and close-knit community it was as if she had tried to betray the honor of them all. She had broken the solid front the County presented to the world. By her attempt to get money from the Yankee government she had aligned herself with Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, more hated enemies than the Yankee soldiers had ever been. She, a member of an old and staunchly Confederate family, a planter’s family, had gone over to the enemy and by so doing had brought shame on every family in the County.
<p>The mourners were seething with indignation and downcast with sorrow, especially three of them—old man McRae, who had been Gerald’s crony since he came to the up-country from Savannah so many years before, Grandma Fontaine who loved him because he was Ellen’s husband, and Mrs. Tarleton who had been closer to him than to any of her neighbors because, as she often said, he was the only man in the County who knew a stallion from a gelding.</p></div>
  <div class="right">他们认为，苏伦的过错不仅是杀害了自己的父亲。她还曾设法使父亲背叛南方。在当地那种严厉的封闭的社会里，这样做就等于背叛他们大家的荣誉。她打破了本地区在世人面前展示的牢固的联合阵线，她企图向北方政府要钱，这就和从北方来的冒险家和投靠北方的南方人站到一边去了，而这样的人比北方军的大兵还要遭憎恨。她出身于一个历史悠久的坚决支持联盟的家庭，出身于一个农场主的家庭，却投靠了敌人，从而给本地的所有家庭带来了耻辱。送葬的人一方面因为忿怒而激动，另一方面因为悲伤而沉闷，其中有三个人尤其如此，一个是麦克雷老头儿，自从多年前杰拉尔德从萨凡纳搬到这里，他们就成了最要好的朋友。另一个是方丹老太太，她喜欢杰拉尔德，因为他是爱伦的丈夫，还有一个是塔尔顿太太，她对杰拉尔德比对别的邻居更亲近些，她常常说，当地只有杰拉尔德一人能分得出公马和阉马。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The sight of the stormy faces of these three in the dim parlor where Gerald lay before the funeral had caused Ashley and Will some uneasiness and they had retired to Ellen’s office for a consultation.
<p>“Some of them are goin’ to say somethin’ about Suellen,” said Will abruptly, biting his straw in half. They think they got just cause to say somethin’. Maybe they have. It ain’t for me to say. But, Ashley, whether they’re right or not, we’ll have to resent it, bein’ the men of the family, and then there’ll be trouble. Can’t nobody do nothin’ with old man McRae because he’s deaf as a post and can’t hear folks tryin’ to shut him up. And you know there ain’t nobody in God’s world ever stopped Grandma Fontaine from speakin’ her mind. And as for Mrs. Tarleton—did you see her roll them russet eyes of hers every time she looked at Sue? She’s got her ears laid back and can’t hardly wait. If they say somethin’, we got to take it up and we got enough trouble at Tara now without bein’ at outs with our neighbors.”</p>Ashley sighed worriedly. He knew the tempers of his neighbors better than Will did and he remembered that fully half of the quarrels and some of the shootings of the days before the war had risen from the County custom of saying a few words over the coffins of departed neighbors. Generally the words were eulogistic in the extreme but occasionally they were not. Sometimes, words meant in the utmost respect were misconstrued by overstrung relatives of the dead and scarcely were the last shovels of earth mounded above the coffin before trouble began.
</div>
  <div class="right">葬礼之前，在停放灵柩的客厅里，这三个人怒容满面，艾希礼和威尔一看这情况，感到有些紧张，就来到爱伦生前的办事房里商量对策。<p>“他们有人要谴责苏伦，"威尔直截了当地说，一面说，一面把一根稻草放进嘴里咬成两段。"他们自以为有理由谴责她。也许他们是对的。这一点，我管不着。可是，艾希礼，无论他们说该说不该说，我们都不能赞成，因为我们是家中管事的男人。这样一来，就会出麻烦。谁能想个法子，别让麦克雷老头讲话，他聋得像个木头桩子，他要是讲起来，谁阻止他，他也听不见。你清楚，方丹老太太要是劳叨起来，天底下谁也没法让她停下来，而塔尔顿太太，你没看见吗，她每次见到苏伦，红眼珠子不停地转。她现在什么都听不进去，到了急不可耐的地步。他们要是说些什么，我们就非得顶他们不可。即使不和邻居顶嘴，现在我们这里的麻烦事也就够多的了。"</p>艾希礼叹了口气，他非常担心。邻居们的议论，他比威尔更清楚。而且他知道，在战前，邻居之间的争吵，甚至互相开枪，多半是因为送葬者要对着死者的灵柩讲几句话这种习俗而引起的。这葬者往往都是说些赞美的话，但也不尽然，有时说话者的本意是要表示极大的尊敬，而死者的亲属过于敏感，却产生了误会，因此棺材上面刚填完最后一铣土，接着就出现了麻烦。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">In the absence of a priest Ashley was to conduct the services with the aid of Carreen’s Book of Devotions, the assistance of the Methodist and Baptist preachers of Jonesboro and Fayetteville having been tactfully refused. Carreen, more devoutly Catholic than her sisters, had been very upset that Scarlett had neglected to bring a priest from Atlanta with her and had only been a little eased by the reminder that when the priest came down to marry Will and Suellen, he could read the services over Gerald. It was she who objected to the neighboring Protestant preachers and gave the matter into Ashley’s hands, marking passages in her book for him to read. Ashley, leaning against the old secretary, knew that the responsibility for preventing trouble lay with him and, knowing the hair-trigger tempers of the County, was at a loss as to how to proceed.</div>
  <div class="right">琼斯博罗和弗耶特维尔这两个地方的卫理公会牧师和浸礼会牧师都表示愿意来帮忙，但是都被婉言谢绝了。既然没有牧师，就由艾希礼拿着卡琳的《忠诚福音》来主持仪式。卡琳信奉天主教，姐妹们中她最虔诚，对于思嘉没有想到从亚特兰大请一位牧师来十分不满。后来人们提醒她，等以后有牧师来主持威尔和苏伦的婚礼时，还可以到杰拉尔德坟上去祈祷一番，这才使她的气消了一点。就是她极力反对请附近的新教牧师，而把仪式交给艾希礼来主持，她还把书中该读的段落作了记号。艾希礼在这位老秘书的帮助下可以主持仪式，但他明白自己肩负着防止出麻烦的重任，同时也了解老乡们的火爆脾气，不知怎样主持才好。
</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“There’s no help for it, Will,” he said, rumpling his bright hair. “I can’t knock Grandma Fontaine down or old man McRae either, and I can’t hold my hand over Mrs. Tarleton’s mouth. And the mildest thing they’ll say is that Suellen is a murderess and a traitor and but for her Mr. O’Hara would still be alive. Damn this custom of speaking over the dead. It’s barbarous.”
<p>“Look, Ash,” said Will slowly. “I ain’t aimin’ to have nobody say nothin’ against Suellen, no matter what they think. You leave it to me. When you’ve finished with the readin’ and the prayin’ and you say: ‘If anyone would like to say a few words,’ you look right at me, so I can speak first.”</p>But Scarlett, watching the pallbearers’ difficulty in getting the coffin through the narrow entrance into the burying ground, had no thought of trouble to come after the funeral. She was thinking with a leaden heart that in burying Gerald she was burying one of the last links that joined her to the old days of happiness and irresponsibility.
</div>
  <div class="right">“真没主意，威尔，"艾希礼一面抓着光亮的头发，一面说。"我既不能把方丹老太太和麦克雷老头儿打倒在地，也不能捂住塔尔顿太太的嘴不让她说话。他们起码会说苏伦是个杀人犯，是叛徒。要不是她，奥哈拉先生是不会死的。这种对着死者说话的习俗真是要命。这是一种野蛮的作法。"<p>“你听我说，艾希礼，"威尔慢条斯理的说。"我今天决不让任何人谴责苏伦，不管他是怎么想的，你等着看我的吧。你念完了经书，作完了祈祷，说'谁想讲几句话吗'，这时你就朝我看一看，我就头一个出来讲话。"</p>思嘉呢，她看着那几个人抬着棺材勉强进了小门，来到墓地，她压根儿没有想到仪式之后会出什么麻烦。她心里十分沉重，觉得父亲这一入土，意味着她与往昔无忧无虑的幸福生活之间的纽带又少了一条。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Finally the pallbearers set the coffin down near the grave and stood clenching and unclenching their aching fingers. Ashley, Melanie and Will filed into the enclosure and stood behind the O’Hara girls. All the closer neighbors who could crowd in were behind them and the others stood outside the brick wall. Scarlett, really seeing them for the first time, was surprised and touched by the size of the crowd. With transportation so limited it was kind of so many to come. There were fifty or sixty people there, some of them from so far away she wondered how they had heard in time to come. There were whole families from Jonesboro and Fayetteville and Lovejoy and with them a few negro servants. Many small farmers from far across the river were present and Crackers from the backwoods and a scattering of swamp folk. The swamp men were lean bearded giants in homespun, coon-skin caps on their heads, their rifles easy in the crooks of their arms, their wads of tobacco stilled in their cheeks. Their women were with them, their bare feet sunk in the soft red earth, their lower lips full of snuff. Their faces beneath their sun-bonnets were sallow and malarial-looking but shining clean and their freshly ironed calicoes glistened with starch.</div>
  <div class="right">抬棺材的人终于把棺材放在墓穴旁，站在了一边，同时活动活动酸疼的手指。艾希礼、媚兰和威尔依次来到墓地，站在奥哈拉家三姐妹的身后，比较亲近的邻居挤了进来，其他的人站在砖墙外面。思嘉头一次和这些人见面，对这么多人来送葬有些惊讶，也很感动。交通不便，来的人就算很多了，总共大约有五六十人，有些人是远道而来的，思嘉不知道他们是如何得到消息，及进赶来的。有些是全家带着黑奴从琼斯博罗、费耶特维尔和洛夫乔伊赶来的。许多小农场主从河那边赶了很远的路来参加葬礼，在场的还有几个从山林的沼泽地来的穷苦人，沼泽地的男人都是细高个子，留着长胡子，身穿租毛外衣，头戴浣熊皮帽，长枪，随便挂在胳臂上，口里含着烟叶，他们的老婆也都来了。这些女人光着脚站在松软的红土地上，下嘴唇上沾满了烟末。她们头戴遮阳帽，脸色发暗，仿佛得了疟疾，但都是干干净净，浆过熨过的印花布衣服显得发亮。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The near neighbors were there in full force. Grandma Fontaine, withered, wrinkled and yellow as an old molted bird, was leaning on her cane, and behind her were Sally Munroe Fontaine and Young Miss Fontaine. They were trying vainly by whispered pleas and jerks at her skirt to make the old lady sit down on the brick wall. Grandma’s husband, the Old Doctor, was not there. He had died two months before and much of the bright malicious joy of life had gone from her old eyes. Cathleen Calvert Hilton stood alone as befitted one whose husband had helped bring about the present tragedy, her faded sunbonnet hiding her bowed face. Scarlett saw with amazement that her percale dress had grease spots on it and her hands were freckled and unclean. There were even black crescents under her fingernails. There was nothing of quality folks about Cathleen now. She looked Cracker, even worse. She looked poor white, shiftless, slovenly, trifling.</div>
  <div class="right">左邻右舍是全体出动了，方丹老太太面容憔悴，脸色发黄，像是一只掉了毛的鸟，倚着手杖在那里站着，站在她身后的是萨利.芒罗.方丹和年轻的方丹小姐。她们小声恳求老太太。甚至拽她的裙子，想让她坐在矮墙上，可老太太就是不肯坐。老太太的丈夫，人们管他叫老大夫，没有在场，他已经在两个月之前去世了，那以后，许多生活的乐趣就从老太太的眼睛里消失了。凯瑟琳.卡尔弗特.希尔顿独自一人站在那里，这倒也合适，因为目前这场悲剧，她丈夫也是有责任的。她戴着一顶褪了色的遮阳帽，低垂着头，思嘉惊讶地到看凯瑟琳是细纱长裙上挂着油渍，手上长了黑斑，也不干净，指甲盖底下都是泥。如今的凯瑟琳已经失去了上流社会的风度。她穷了，不仅如此，她贫困潦倒、无精打采、邋邋遢遢，无可奈何地混日子。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“She’ll be dipping snuff soon, if she isn’t doing it already,” thought Scarlett in horror. “Good Lord! What a comedown!”
<p>She shuddered, turning her eyes from Cathleen as she realized how narrow was the chasm between quality folk and poor whites.</p>“There but for a lot of gumption am I,” she thought, and pride surged through her as she realized that she and Cathleen had started with the same equipment after the surrender—empty hands and what they had in their heads.
<p>“I haven’t done so bad,” she thought, lifting her chin and smiling.</p>But she stopped in mid-smile as she saw the scandalized eyes of Mrs. Tarleton upon her. Her eyes were red-rimmed from tears and, after giving Scarlett a reproving look, she turned her gaze back to Suellen, a fierce angry gaze that boded ill for her. Behind her and her husband were the four Tarleton girls, their red locks indecorous notes in the solemn occasion, their russet eyes still looking like the eyes of vital young animals, spirited and dangerous.
</div>
  <div class="right">“她不定哪一天就会嚼烟末了，说不定她已经嚼上了。"思嘉想到这里，感到惊恐不安，"我的天哪！真是今非昔比啊！"<p>她打了一个冷战，赶忙把眼光从凯瑟琳身上移开，因为她意识到上流社会与穷百姓之间的距离是微乎其微的。</p>“我就是比别人能干，"思嘉这样想。她又想到南方投降以后，她和凯瑟琳是在同样的条件下干起来的，都是一个脑袋两只手，心里感到一阵宽慰。<p>“我干得不错，"她一面想，一面仰起脸来，露出了微笑。</p>她这微笑只笑了一半便收敛起来，因为她注意到塔尔顿太太正瞪着大眼盯着她。塔尔顿太太眼圈都哭红了，她用责备的目光瞪了思嘉一眼以后，又把目光转到苏伦身上，她那异常愤怒的眼光说明苏伦要倒霉了。在她和她丈夫身后站着塔尔顿家的四个姑娘，她们的红头发对眼前这严肃的场合不是合适的，她们那红棕色的眼睛和欢蹦乱跳的小动物的眼睛一样，又精神，又让人害怕。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Feet were stilled, hats were removed, hands folded and skirts rustled into quietness as Ashley stepped forward with Carreen’s worn Book of Devotions in his hand. He stood for a moment looking down, the sun glittering on his golden head. A deep silence fell on the crowd, so deep that the harsh whisper of the wind in the magnolia leaves came clear to their ears and the far-off repetitious note of a mockingbird sounded unendurably loud and sad. Ashley began to read the prayers and all heads bowed as his resonant, beautifully modulated voice rolled out the brief and dignified words.
<p>“Oh!” thought Scarlett, her throat constricting. “How beautiful his voice is! If anyone has to do this for Pa, I’m glad it’s Ashley. I’d rather have him than a priest. I’d rather have Pa buried by one of his own folks than a stranger.”</p></div>
  <div class="right">过了一会儿，艾希礼站出来，手里拿着卡琳的旧经书《忠诚福音》，这时大家都不再走动，帽子都摘了，两手交叉着，连裙子的啊啊声也听不见了。艾希礼低头站了一会儿，阳光照得他那一头金发闪闪发光。人群中间没有一丝声音，微风吹过木兰的枝叶发出的窃窃私语可以听得清清楚楚，远处一只模仿鸟不停地发出刺耳的哀鸣，让人无法忍受。艾希礼开始读祈祷文，所有的人都低头听他用洪亮而有节奏的声音一字一顿地读那简短而庄重的经文。<p>“啊！他的声音多好听啊！"思嘉想着，喉咙里感到一阵哽咽。"如果爸爸的葬礼说一定得有人主持，我倒愿意让艾希礼来主持。我宁愿让他主持，也不让一个牧师来主持。我宁愿让他也不愿让一个生人来掩埋父亲的遗骨。"</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">When Ashley came to the part of the prayers concerning the souls in Purgatory, which Carreen had marked for him to read, he abruptly closed the book. Only Carreen noticed the omission and looked up puzzled, as he began the Lord’s Prayer. Ashley knew that half the people present had never heard of Purgatory and those who had would take it as a personal affront, if he insinuated, even in prayer, that so fine a man as Mr. O’Hara had not gone straight to Heaven. So, in deference to public opinion, he skipped all mention of Purgatory. The gathering joined heartily in the Lord’s Prayer but their voices trailed off into embarrassed silence when he began the Hail Mary. They had never heard that prayer and they looked furtively at each other as the O’Hara girls, Melanie and the Tara servants gave the response: “Pray for us, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.”</div>
  <div class="right">艾希礼该读炼狱里的灵魂一节了，这一节也是卡琳作了记号让他读的，但是他突然停下来，把书合上了。只有卡琳发现他没读这一切，她感到困惑，就抬起头来，只听艾希礼接着读起了主祷文。艾希礼这样做，是因为他知道在场的人有一半从没有听说过炼狱，如果他们听了后发现他暗示像奥哈拉先生这样的好人也没有能直接进入天堂，即使是在祈祷文中所这种暗示，也会认为他是进行人身攻击。因此，他尊重大家的意见，把炼狱这一切省略了。大家热情地跟着他读主祷文，但是在他开始读"万福马利亚"的时候，大家的声音逐渐减弱，以至于完全沉静下来，使人感到尴尬，他们以前可从来没听说过这篇祈祷文，于是开始偷偷地交换眼色，只有奥哈拉家的小姐们，媚兰，还有几个仆人跟着说：“请为我们祈祷，现在以及将来我们死的时候都为我们祈祷。阿门。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Then Ashley raised his head and stood for a moment, uncertain. The eyes of the neighbors were expectantly upon him as they settled themselves in easier positions for a long harangue. They were waiting for him to go on with the service, for it did not occur to any of them that he was at the end of the Catholic prayers. County funerals were always long. The Baptist and Methodist ministers who performed them had no set prayers but extemporized as the circumstances demanded and seldom stopped before all mourners were in tears and the bereaved feminine relatives screaming with grief. The neighbors would have been shocked, aggrieved and indignant, had these brief prayers been all the service over the body of their loved friend, and no one knew this better than Ashley. The matter would be discussed at dinner tables for weeks and the opinion of the County would be that the O’Hara girls had not shown proper respect for their father.</div>
  <div class="right">艾希礼抬起头来，站了一会儿，不知怎样进行下去。邻居们用期待的眼光看着他，同时调整了一个姿势，站得随便一点，等着听期讲话。大家都觉得仪式还应该继续下去，谁也没想到他主持的这天主都祈祷仪式就要结束了。这里的葬礼一向拖得很长。卫理公会和浸礼会的牧师主持葬礼，没有固定的祈祷文，而是根据具体情况边想边说，而且往往都要说得所有送葬的人落泪，死都家属中的妇女嚎啕大哭，为亲密的朋友举行的葬礼，如果只读几篇简短的祈祷文就算完了，邻居们是会感到惊讶，感到伤心，感到忿怒的。这一点，艾希礼比谁都清楚。人们会把这件事当做饭桌上的话题谈上几个星期，老百姓会认为奥哈拉家的小姐们对父亲不够敬重。</div></div>

  <div class="left">So he threw a quick apologetic glance at Carreen and, bowing his head again, began reciting from memory the Episcopal burial service which he had often read over slaves buried at Twelve Oaks.
<p>“I am the Resurrection and the Life ... and whosoever ... believeth in Me shall never die.”</p>It did not come back to him readily and he spoke slowly, occasionally falling silent for a space as he waited for phrases to rise from his memory. But this measured delivery made his words more impressive, and mourners who had been dry-eyed before began now to reach for handkerchiefs. Sturdy Baptists and Methodists all, they thought it the Catholic ceremony and immediately rearranged their first opinion that the Catholic services were cold and Popish. Scarlett and Suellen were equally ignorant and thought the words comforting and beautiful. Only Melanie and Carreen realized that a devoutly Catholic Irishman was being laid to rest by the Church of England’s service. And Carreen was too stunned by grief and her hurt at Ashley’s treachery to interfere.
</div>
  <div class="right">所以，艾希礼很快瞧了卡琳一眼，表示歉意，接着就又低下头，背诵起圣公会葬礼祈祷文来了，他以前曾多次在"十二橡树"村用这篇祈祷文给奴隶们送葬。<p>“我能使你复活，我能给你生命。……无论何人。……凡信我者，必将永生。"</p>这篇祈祷文他也没有记得很清楚，所以他背得很慢，有时甚至停下来，回忆下面应该怎么说。但是他这样一字一顿地说，却使得艾希礼的话更为感人。一直没有掉泪的人现在开始纷纷掏手绢了。虔诚的卫理公会教徒和浸礼会教徒都认为这是一次天主教仪式，起初他们以为天主教仪式都是庄严肃穆，不动感情的，现在也改变了他们的看法，思嘉和苏伦都毫无觉察，还觉得艾希礼的话又入耳又动听。只有媚兰和卡琳已经悲伤过度，看到艾希礼这样胡闹又感到非常伤心，但是没有出来制止。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">When he had finished, Ashley opened wide his sad gray eyes and looked about the crowd. After a pause, his eyes caught those of Will and he said: “Is there anyone present who would like to say a word?”
<p>Mrs. Tarleton twitched nervously but before she could act, Will stumped forward and standing at the head of the coffin began to speak.</p>“Friends,” he began in his flat voice, “maybe you think I’m gettin’ above myself, speakin’ first—me who never knew Mr. O’Hara till “bout a year ago when you all have known him twenty years or more. But this here is my excuse. If he’d lived a month or so longer, I’d have had the right to call him Pa.”
<p>A startled ripple went over the crowd. They were too well bred to whisper but they shifted on their feet and stared at Carreen’s bowed head. Everyone knew his dumb devotion to her. Seeing the direction in which all eyes were cast, Will went on as if he had taken no note.</p>“So bein’ as how I’m to marry Miss Suellen as soon as the priest comes down from Atlanta, I thought maybe that gives me the right to speak first.”
</div>
  <div class="right">艾希礼背完以后，睁大他那双悲哀的灰色的眼睛，环顾四周。接着他与威尔交换了个眼色，就说：“有谁想讲几句话吗？"<p>塔尔顿太太的嘴唇动了一动，显得非常紧张，可是没等她开口，威尔就吃力地迈步向前，站在棺材面讲起话来。</p>“朋友们，"他用平静的语调说，"我头一次出来讲话，也许你们会觉得我太狂妄了，因为我是大给一年前认识奥哈拉生先的，而你们认识了已经二十年，或者二十多年了，但是我有一条理由：他要是能够活上一个月，我就可以他爸爸了。"<p>人们露出惊讶的神色，这些人都是很有教养的，不会悄悄说话，但他们的脚交替挪动，眼睛转身卡琳。卡琳低着头站在那里，大家都知道威尔一下爱着卡琳，威尔看到大家都向那边看，便若无其事地继续说下去。</p>“因为我即将和苏伦小姐结婚，只等牧师从亚特兰大前来主持婚礼，我想我是有权第一个讲话的。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The last part of his speech was lost in a faint sibilant buzz that went through the gathering, an angry beelike buzz. There were indignation and disappointment in the sound. Everyone liked Will, everyone respected him for what he had done for Tara. Everyone knew his affections lay with Carreen, so the news that he was to marry the neighborhood pariah instead sat ill upon them. Good old Will marrying that nasty, sneaking little Suellen O’Hara!
<p>For a moment the air was tense. Mrs. Tarleton’s eyes began to snap and her lips to shape soundless words. In the silence, old man McRae’s high voice could be heard imploring his grandson to tell him what had been said. Will faced them all, still mild of face, but there was something in his pale blue eyes which dared them to say one word about his future wife. For a moment the balance hung between the honest affection everyone had for Will and their contempt for Suellen. And Will won. He continued as if his pause had been a natural one.</p></div>
  <div class="right">威尔的话还未说完，人群里就出现了一阵轻微的骚动，发出了像蜜蜂嗡嗡叫的忿怒的声音。这声音里既包含着愤怒，也包含着失望。大家都喜欢威尔，都尊敬他，因为他为塔拉出了大力。大家也都知道他喜欢卡琳，因此当他们听到他要和最近最受大家鄙视的人结婚的消息时，感到无法接受。善良的威尔怎么会和那个卑鄙可恶的小人苏伦.奥哈拉结婚呢？<p>气氛一度十分紧张。塔尔顿在太太两眼射出了愤怒的目光，嘴唇动了动，仿佛要说什么，却没有说出声来。在一片寂静之中，可以听见麦克雷老头高声恳求孙子告诉他刚才威尔说了些什么。威尔面对众人，脸色依然温和，但他那双浅蓝色的眼睛却好像在说，看谁敢对他未来的妻子说三道四。霎那间人们难以决定，他们既疼爱威尔又鄙视苏伦。后来还是威尔胜利了。他继续讲下去，他们刚才的停顿是讲话中自然的停顿。</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I never knew Mr. O’Hara in his prime like you all done. All I knew personally was a fine old gentleman who was a mite addled. But I’ve heard tell from you all “bout what he used to be like. And I want to say this. He was a fightin’ Irishman and a Southern gentleman and as loyal a Confederate as ever lived. You can’t get no better combination than that. And we ain’t likely to see many more like him, because the times that bred men like him are as dead as he is. He was born in a furrin country but the man we’re buryin’ here today was more of a Georgian than any of us mournin’ him. He lived our life, he loved our land and, when you come right down to it, he died for our Cause, same as the soldiers did. He was one of us and he had our good points and our bad points and he had our strength and he had our failin’s. He had our good points in that couldn’t nothin’ stop him when his mind was made up and he warn’t scared of nothin’ that walked in shoe leather. There warn’t nothin’ that come to him from the outside that could lick him.</div>
  <div class="right">“奥哈拉先生风华正茂的时候你们就认识他了，而我不认识他。我只知道他是位善良的老先生，不过有点糊涂。我从你们那里了解到他过去的所作所为。我想在这里说的是：奥哈拉先生是一位爱尔兰战士，是南方的一位高尚的人，是最忠于联盟的一个人。这三种品质集中在一个人身上，这是很难能可贵的，以后恐怕也不会有很多像他这样的人，因为产生像他这样的人的时代和他本人一样，已经过去了。他是在国外出生的，我们今天给他送葬，但是他比我们所有送葬的人更肯有佐治亚人的特质。他和我们共同生活，他热爱我们的土地，说真的，他和那些战死的士兵一样，是为我们的事业而死的。他是我们当中的一员，他有我们的优点，也有我们的缺点，有我们的长处，也有我们的短处。他的一个优点就是一旦他决心做某种事情，那就什么力量也阻拦不住他，什么人也吓不倒他，任何来自外界的东西都不能把他怎么样。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“He warn’t scared of the English government when they wanted to hang him. He just lit out and left home. And when he come to this country and was pore, that didn’t scare him a mite neither. He went to work and he made his money. And he warn’t scared to tackle this section when it was part wild and the Injuns had just been run out of it. He made a big plantation out of a wilderness. And when the war come on and his money begun to go, he warn’t scared to be pore again. And when the Yankees come through Tara and might of burnt him out or killed him, he warn’t fazed a bit and he warn’t licked neither. He just planted his front feet and stood his ground. That’s why I say he had our good points. There ain’t nothin’ from the outside can lick any of us.</div>
  <div class="right">“当时英国政府要绞死他，他并不惧怕，他离开家，跑了。他刚来美国的时候很穷，可是他一点也不怕，他找到了工作，挣到了钱。这个地方原来是一片荒野，刚和印度安人赶走，他来开发这个地方，可是他一点也不怕。他硬是在荒野之中开出一个大农常战争爆发以后，他的钱越来越少了，可是他不怕再过穷日子。北方佬来到塔拉以后，要烧他的房子，要杀死他，可是他一点也不怕，他们也没有把他怎么样，他就直挺挺地站在那里，寸步不让。所以我说他具有我们的优点，任何来自外界的力量也不能把他怎么样。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“But he had our failin’s too, ‘cause he could be licked from the inside. I mean to say that what the whole world couldn’t do, his own heart could. When Mrs. O’Hara died, his heart died too and he was licked. And what we seen walking ‘round here warn’t him.”
<p>Will paused and his eyes went quietly around the circle of faces. The crowd stood in the hot sun as if enchanted to the ground and whatever wrath they had felt for Suellen was forgotten. Will’s eyes rested for a moment on Scarlett and they crinkled slightly at the corners as if he were inwardly smiling comfort to her. Scarlett, who had been fighting back rising tears, did feel comforted. Will was talking common sense instead of a lot of tootle about reunions in another and better world and submitting her will to God’s. And Scarlett had always found strength and comfort in common sense.</p></div>
  <div class="right">“但是他也有我们的缺点，他是可以从内部攻破的。我的意思是说，虽然整个世界都不能把他怎么样，他的心却能做到这一点。奥哈拉太太去世的时候，他的心也死了，他被攻破了。后来我们看到的奥哈拉先生已经不是原来的奥哈拉先生了。"<p>威尔说到这里停了一下，扫视了一眼周围的人们。他们站在烈日之下，好像入了神，固定在地上了。无论他们对苏伦多么愤慨，这时也都忘得干干净净。威尔的目光在思嘉身上停了片刻，眼角微微眨了眨，仿佛内心里在在微笑，以给她一些安慰。思嘉一直在抑制着自己的泪水，这时的的确确感到的了安慰。威尔的话句句在理，他没有说什么在另一个更美好的世界里团聚之类不中听的话，也没有劝她屈从于上帝的意旨，而思嘉听到在理的话，总感到增加了力量，得到了安慰。</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“And I don’t want none of you to think the less of him for breakin’ like he done. All you all and me, too, are like him. We got the same weakness and failin’. There ain’t nothin’ that walks can lick us, any more than it could lick him, not Yankees nor Carpetbaggers nor hard times nor high taxes nor even downright starvation. But that weakness that’s in our hearts can lick us in the time it takes to bat your eye. It ain’t always losin’ someone you love that does it, like it done Mr. O’Hara. Everybody’s mainspring is different. And I want to say this—folks whose mainsprings are busted are better dead. There ain’t no place for them in the world these days, and they’re happier bein’ dead. ... That’s why I’m sayin’ you all ain’t got no cause to grieve for Mr. O’Hara now. The time to grieve was back when Sherman come through and he lost Mrs. O’Hara. Now that his body’s gone to join his heart, I don’t see that we got reason to mourn, unless we’re pretty damned selfish, and I’m sayin’ it who loved him like he was my own pa. ... There won’t be no more words said, if you folks don’t mind. The family is too cut up to listen and it wouldn’t be no kindness to them.”</div>
  <div class="right">“我希望大家不要因为最后出了那样的事对死者有所轻视。你们大家，还有我，也都和他一样，我们也有同样的短处，同样的弱点。任何人都不能把他怎么样，也不能把我们怎么样，无论是北方佬，还是从北方来的的冒险家，无论是艰难的生活，苛捐杂税，还是严重的饥饿，都不可能把我们怎么样。但是我们心中的弱点却能在瞬间把我们毁掉。不一定要失去亲人才触动我们的感情，像奥哈拉先生那样。人好比一部机器，都有一个发条，而这发条又因人而异。我的意思是：如果谁身上的发条断了，他就不如死了的好。在当今的世界上没有他的位置，他还是死了更快活。……所以我说你们大家现在不必为奥哈拉先生感到痛苦。昔日谢尔曼来到这里，奥哈拉先生失去妻子的时候，倒是应该感到悲痛的。现在他的躯体去和他的心会合了，我们就没有理由为他感到悲痛了，如果还感到悲痛，就太自私了。我爱他就像爱自己的父亲，所以才这样说。……如果大家不介意，咱们就讲到这里。家属都很难过，别再增加他们的痛苦了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Will stopped and, turning to Mrs. Tarleton, he said in a lower voice: “I wonder couldn’t you take Scarlett in the house, Ma’m? It ain’t right for her to be standin’ in the sun so long. And Grandma Fontaine don’t look any too peart neither, meanin’ no disrespect,”
<p>Startled at the abrupt switching from the eulogy to herself, Scarlett went red with embarrassment as all eyes turned toward her. Why should Will advertise her already obvious pregnancy? She gave him a shamed indignant look, but Will’s placid gaze bore her down.</p>“Please,” his look said. “I know what I’m doin’.”
<p>Already he was the man of the house and, not wishing to make a scene, Scarlett turned helplessly to Mrs. Tarleton. That lady, suddenly diverted, as Will had intended, from thoughts of Suellen to the always fascinating matter of breeding, be it animal or human, took Scarlett’s arm.</p>“Come in the house, honey.”
</div>
  <div class="right">威尔说完这话，转向塔尔顿太太，放低了声音说：“夫人，能不能请您扶着思嘉回屋里去？让她在太阳底下站这么时间不合适。方丹老太太看上去精神也不大好，我可不是说她有对死者不尊敬的意思。"<p>话题突然从颂扬死者转到思嘉身上，使她感到很惊讶，大家都把目光向她投来，她脸立时就红了，觉得很难为情。她怀孕已经很明白了，威尔为什么还要加以宣扬呢？她不好意思而又气愤地瞪了威尔一眼，威尔不动声色地看着她，她只好屈服了。威尔的眼神好像在说：</p>“请吧！我是有意这样做的。"他已经成了这个家的主人了。<p>不过思嘉不想大闹一番，所以无可奈何地朝塔尔顿太太走去，由于威尔故意把塔尔顿太太的注意力从苏伦身上引开，引到生育问题上来，而这又正是她一向最感兴趣的问题，无论是动物生育还是人生育都一样，因此这时她就挽起了思嘉的胳臂。</p>“到屋里去吧，我的宝贝儿。”</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Her face took on a look of kind, absorbed interest and Scarlett suffered herself to be led through the crowd that gave way and made a narrow path for her. There was a sympathetic murmuring as she passed and several hands went out to pat her comfortingly. When she came abreast Grandma Fontaine, the old lady put out a skinny claw and said: “Give me your arm, child,” and added with a fierce glance at Sally and Young Miss: “No, don’t you come. I don’t want you.”
<p>They passed slowly through the crowd which closed behind them and went up the shady path toward the house, Mrs. Tarleton’s eager helping hand so strong under Scarlett’s elbow that she was almost lifted from the ground at each step.</p>“Now, why did Will do that?” cried Scarlett heatedly, when they were out of earshot. “He practically said: ‘Look at her! She’s going to have a baby!’ ”
</div>
  <div class="right">她一面说，脸上一面露出非常热心的样子，思嘉只得由她搀着走，人们给她让出一条通路来，大家低声向她表示同情，有人在她走过时还抻出手拍拍她，表示慰问。她走到方丹老太太面前时，老太太伸出一只干瘦的手，说：“孩子，我扶着你进去吧。"她还用严厉的目光看了看萨利和年轻的方丹小姐，说：“你们不用来，我不要你们。"<p>她们慢慢穿过人群，人们随即又合扰了，她们沿着树荫下面的小路向房子走去。塔尔顿太太显得太热心，使劲托着思嘉的胳膊肘，几乎每走一步都要把思嘉提得脚不着地了。等她们走远了，别人听不见了，思嘉激动地说：</p>“威尔为什么这样说？这等于说：'你们看哪！她要生孩子了！'"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well, sake’s alive, you are, aren’t you?” said Mrs. Tarleton. “Will did right It was foolish of you to stand in the hot sun when you might have fainted and had a miscarriage.”
<p>“Will wasn’t bothered about her miscarrying,” said Grandma, a little breathless as she labored across the front yard toward the steps. There was a grim, knowing smile on her face. “Will’s smart. He didn’t want either you or me, Beetrice, at the graveside. He was scared of what we’d say and he knew this was the only way to get rid of us. ... And it was more than that. He didn’t want Scarlett to hear the clods dropping on the coffin. And he’s right. Just remember, Scarlett, as long as you don’t hear that sound, folks aren’t actually dead to you. But once you hear it ... Well, it’s the most dreadfully final sound in the world. ... Help me up the steps, child, and give me a hand, Beetrice. Scarlett don’t any more need your arm than she needs crutches and I’m not so peart, as Will observed. ... Will knew you were your father’s pet and he didn’t want to make it worse for you than it already was. He figured it wouldn’t be so bad for your sisters. Suellen has her shame to sustain her and Carreen her God. But you’ve got nothing to sustain you, have you, child?”</p></div>
  <div class="right"><p>“怎么，难道你不真是要生孩子吗？"塔尔顿太太说。"威尔那样做是对的。你本来就不该在大太阳底下站着。你要是晒晕倒了，就会引起流产的。"</p>“威尔并不是担心她流产，"方丹老太太一面气喘吁吁地说，一面吃力地穿过前院朝房前的台阶走去，老太太心眼多，对刚才的情况看得明白，因此脸上带着笑容。"威尔干得漂亮。比阿特里斯，你要知道，他既不希望你也不希望我在墓旁再待久了。他怕我们说些什么，只好用这样方法把我们打发走……。……还不光是这样。他还不愿意让思嘉听见土块落在棺材上的声音。他这样做是对的。思嘉，你要记住，你只要没听见往棺材上盖土的声音，死去的人对你说来还没有死。可是你一旦听见那声音。……那真是世界上最可怕的一种声音，因为它意味着终结。……要上台阶了，扶我一下，孩子，帮我一把，比阿特里斯。思嘉用不着拐杖，也用不着你搀她。我倒正像威尔刚才说了，精神不大好。……威尔知道你是你父亲的宠儿，你已经够受的了，他不想让你受更多的罪。他觉得你那两个妹妹会比你好受一点。苏伦做了亏心事，理应在那里顶着。卡琳有上帝保佑，而你就没有什么可依靠的了，孩子，是不是？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“No,” answered Scarlett, helping the old lady up the Steps, faintly surprised at the truth that sounded in the reedy old voice. “I’ve never had anything to sustain me—except Mother.”
<p>“But when you lost her, you found you could stand alone, didn’t you? Well, some folks can’t. Your pa was one. Will’s right. Don’t you grieve. He couldn’t get along without Ellen and he’s happier where he is. Just like I’ll be happier when I join the Old Doctor.”</p>She spoke without any desire for sympathy and the two gave her none. She spoke as briskly and naturally as if her husband were alive and in Jonesboro and a short buggy ride would bring them together. Grandma was too old and had seen too much to fear death.
<p>“But—you can stand alone too,” said Scarlett.</p>“Yes, but it’s powerful uncomfortable at times.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“是的，"思嘉回答道。她一面搀着老太太上台阶，一面暗自吃惊，老太太袮E着嗓子说话，说得很有点道理。"我从来没有什么依靠，只依靠过我母亲。"<p>“可是你失去母亲以后是能独立生活的，是不是，有些人就不行。你爸爸就是这样，威尔说得地，你用不着难过。你爸爸离开你妈爱伦就没法生活，现在他去了，反而好了，我也一样，等我去跟我那大夫作伴的时候就好了。"</p>她说这话并没有想博得别人的同情，那两个搀她的人也没有她表示同情。她讲得很轻松，自然，仿佛老伴依然活着，就在琼斯博罗，坐上小马车，一会儿就可见面。老太太的确太老了，经历的事也太多了，所以她是不会怕死的。<p>“不过，您也可以独立生活呀，"思嘉说。</p>老太太愉快地看了她一眼，说：“是呀，不过有时候是很难受的。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Look here, Grandma,” interrupted Mrs. Tarleton, “you ought not to talk to Scarlett like that. She’s upset enough already. What with her trip down here and that tight dress and her grief and the heat, she’s got enough to make her miscarry without your adding to it, talking grief and sorrow.”
<p>“God’s nightgown!” cried Scarlett in irritation. I’m not upset! And I’m not one of those sickly miscarrying fools!”</p>“You never can tell,” said Mrs. Tarleton omnisciently. “I lost my first when I saw a bull gore one of our darkies and—you remember my red mare, Nellie? Now, there was the healthiest-looking mare you ever saw but she was nervous and high strung and if I didn’t watch her, she’d—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“哎，老太太，"塔尔顿太太插话说，"你不应该对思嘉说这样的话。她已经够难过的了。她从外地赶回来，衣裳这么瘦，心里又这么难过，天气又这么热，这就足以让她流产了，你还在这里说什么痛苦啊，悲伤埃"<p>“活见鬼！"思嘉烦躁地说：“我并不觉得难过，我不是那种受点风寒就会流产的笨蛋。"</p>“那很难说。“塔尔顿太太怀着无所不知的神情说。"我的头胎就流产了，就因为我看见一只公牛用犄角拱伤了我们的一个黑奴。你还记得我那匹枣红马吧？它叫乃利，你从来没见过那么壮的马，可是它容易紧张，它怀驹的时候，要不是我看得紧，它就--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Beatrice, hush,” said Grandma. “Scarlett wouldn’t miscarry on a bet. Let’s us sit here in the hall where it’s cool. There’s a nice draft through here. Now, you go fetch us a glass of buttermilk, Beetrice, if there’s any in the kitchen. Or look in the pantry and see if there’s any wine. I could do with a glass. We’ll sit here till the folks come up to say good-by.”
<p>“Scarlett ought to be in bed,” insisted Mrs. Tarleton, running her eyes over her with the expert air of one who calculated a pregnancy to the last-minute of its length.</p>“Get going,” said Grandma, giving her a prod with her cane, and Mrs. Tarleton went toward the kitchen, throwing her hat carelessly on the sideboard and running her hands through her damp red hair.
</div>
  <div class="right">“快别说了，比阿特里斯，"老太太说。"思嘉肯定不会流产的。咱们在过道里坐一会儿吧，这里有过堂风凉快，比阿特里斯，你到厨房去看看有没有脱脂牛奶，给我们拿一杯来，要不就到放食品的地方看看有没有酒，我现在可以喝上一杯了。咱们就坐在这儿，等他们告别以后再走。"<p>塔尔顿太太打量了思嘉一番，用十分肯定的语气说：“思嘉该上床去歇歇了，"好像她什么都懂，连预产期是几点几分都能计算出来。</p>“去吧，"老太太一面说，一面用手杖捅了她一下，塔尔顿太太随手把帽子往碗橱上一扔，用手指拢了拢她那湿漉漉的红头发，朝厨房走去。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett lay back in her chair and unbuttoned the two top buttons of her tight basque, it was cool and dim in the high-ceilinged hall and the vagrant draft that went from back to front of the house was refreshing after the heat of the sun. She looked across the hall into the parlor where Gerald had lain and, wrenching her thoughts from him, looked up at the portrait of Grandma Robillard hanging above the fireplace. The bayonet-scarred portrait with its high-piled hair, half-exposed breasts and cool insolence had, as always, a tonic effect upon her.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉往后靠在椅背上，解开紧身衣最上面的两个扣子，过道因屋顶很高，使屋里阴凉，再加上过堂风从后面一直吹到前面，在太阳底下晒了一阵之后，感觉特别凉爽，思嘉顺着过道看去就能看到客厅，杰拉尔德的灵柩原来就停放在这里。不过此刻她顾不上多想父亲，又把眼光移支壁炉上方悬挂的祖母罗毕拉德的肖像。这幅肖像虽然有刺刀破坏的痕迹。但那高挽的头发，那半袒的胸脯和那冷漠高傲的神态，依然和往常一样，使她感到精神振奋。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I don’t know which hit Beetrice Tarleton worse, losing her boys or her horses,” said Grandma Fontaine. “She never did pay much mind to Jim or her girls, you know. She’s one of those folks Will was talking about. Her mainspring’s busted. Sometimes I wonder if she won’t go the way your pa went. She wasn’t ever happy unless horses or humans were breeding right in her face and none of her girls are married or got any prospects of catching husbands in this county, so she’s got nothing to occupy her mind. If she wasn’t such a lady at heart, she’d be downright common. ... Was Will telling the truth about marrying Suellen?”</div>
  <div class="right">“我真不知道，比阿特里斯.塔尔顿究竟是丢了孩子心疼，还是丢了马匹更心疼，"方丹老太太说。"她对吉姆和那几个女儿一向不大关心，你知道吗？她就是威尔刚才所说的那种人。她身上的发条已经断了。有时候我觉得说不定哪天她也会走你爸爸的那条路。她只有亲眼看着人生孩子马下驹儿的时候才高兴，此外她就没有高兴过。她那几个女儿也都没有出嫁，而且没希望能在本地找到丈夫，所以她就没有什么好操心的。她就是这么个怪人。……威尔说要娶苏伦，这是真的吗？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yes,” said Scarlett, looking the old lady full in the eye. Goodness, she could remember the time when she was scared to death of Grandma Fontaine! Well, she’d grown up since then and she’d just as soon as not tell her to go to the devil if she meddled in affairs at Tara.
<p>“He could do better,” said Grandma candidly.</p>“Indeed?” said Scarlett haughtily.
<p>“Come off your high horse, Miss,” said the old lady tartly. “I shan’t attack your precious sister, though I might have if I’d stayed at the burying ground. What I mean is with the scarcity of men in the neighborhood, Will could marry most any of the girls. There’s Beatrice’s four wild cats and the Munroe girls and the McRae—”</p>“He’s going to marry Sue and that’s that.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“是真的，"思嘉两眼盯着老太太说。她记得过去怕这位方丹老太太怕得要命。可现在，她长大了，老太太要是再来掺和什么，她就会立刻对老太太说去见鬼去吧。<p>“他可以找一个更好的嘛，"老太太坦率地说。</p>“是吗？"思嘉顶了她一句。<p>“别那么神气了，小姐，"老太太尖刻地说。"我并不想说你那宝贝妹妹的坏话，我刚才要不是从坟地里走开，也许是会说些什么的。我觉得既然现在这里男人少，威尔可以从大部分女孩子里随便挑。有比阿特里斯的四只野猫，有芒罗家的向个女儿，还有麦克雷家--”</p>“他准备娶苏伦，就这么定了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“She’s lucky to get him.”
<p>“Tara is lucky to get him.”</p>“You love this place, don’t you?”
<p>“Yes.”</p>“So much that you don’t mind your sister marrying out of her class as long as you have a man around to care for Tara?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“苏伦能捞到他，真是走运。"<p>“塔拉能捞到他，才真是走运呢。"</p>“你很喜欢这个地方吧，是不是？"<p>“是的。"</p>“那你就只图有个男人来照料塔拉，竟不考虑等级而让她下嫁吗？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Class?” said Scarlett, startled at the idea. “Class? What does class matter now, so long as a girl gets a husband who can take care of her?”
<p>“That’s a debatable question,” said Old Miss. “Some folks would say you were talking common sense. Others would say you were letting down bars that ought never be lowered one inch. Will’s certainly not quality folks and some of your people were.”</p>Her sharp old eyes went to the portrait of Grandma Robillard.
</div>
  <div class="right">“等级？"思嘉说，她对老太太的这种想法感到惊讶。"什么等级？现在讲等级有什么用，女孩子只要能找到一个丈夫来照顾她就行了。"<p>“这个问题值得研究，”老太太说。"有人会说你这是合乎常理的。有人会说你这是界限模糊了，而这界限是丝毫模糊不得的。威尔无论怎样说也不能算是上等人，而你们家有些人却是上等人埃”</p>老太太敏锐的目光落到思嘉的祖母罗毕拉德的肖像上去了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett thought of Will, lank, unimpressive, mild, eternally chewing a straw, his whole appearance deceptively devoid of energy, like that of most Crackers. He did not have behind him a long line of ancestors of wealth, prominence and blood. The first of Will’s family to set foot on Georgia soil might even have been one of Oglethorpe’s debtors or a bond servant. Will had not been to college. In fact, four years in a backwoods school was all the education he had ever had. He was honest and he was loyal, he was patient and he was hard working, but certainly he was not quality. Undoubtedly by Robillard standards, Suellen was coming down in the world.</div>
  <div class="right">这时思嘉想到威尔，他身材瘦削，其貌不扬，但性情温和，总在嚼一根草根儿，看上去无精打采，南方的穷苦人大都是这样子。他没有什么有钱有势血统高贵的祖先。他家里最初踏上佐治亚州土地的人说不定欠了奥格尔索普的债，也说不定还是个奴隶。威尔也没上过大学，实际上他受过的教育不过是在边远的学校里念过四年书。他诚实可靠，踏实肯干，不过他的确不是上等人。用罗毕拉德那样的标准来衡量，苏伦嫁给她，确实是降低身份了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“So you approve of Will coming into your family?”
<p>“Yes,” answered Scarlett fiercely, ready to pounce upon the old lady at the first words of condemnation.</p>“You may kiss me,” said Grandma surprisingly, and she smiled in her most approving manner. “I never liked you much till now, Scarlett. You were always hard as a hickory nut, even as a child, and I don’t like hard females, barring myself. But I do like the way you meet things. You don’t make a fuss about things that can’t be helped, even if they are disagreeable. You take your fences cleanly like a good hunter.”
<p>Scarlett smiled uncertainly and pecked obediently at the withered cheek presented to her. It was pleasant to hear approving words again, even if she had little idea what they meant.</p>“There’s plenty of folks hereabouts who’ll have something to say about you letting Sue marry a Cracker—for all that everybody likes Will. They’ll say in one breath what a fine man he is and how terrible it is for an O’Hara girl to marry beneath her. But don’t you let it bother you.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“看来你不反对让威尔到你们家来了？”<p>“是的，"思嘉正颜厉色地答道。老太太要是敢来反对，思嘉就会毫不犹豫地朝她扑过去。</p>没想到老太太却说：“你吻我一下吧。"她一面说，一面微笑，表现出极力赞许之意。”我从来没有像现在这样喜欢你。思嘉，你从小就固执，硬得像个山核桃，我不喜欢固执的女人，除我自己不算。不过我的确喜欢你处理事物的方法。对于你无能为力的事，即使你不赞成，也不大吵大闹。你好比一个好猎手，做起来来干净利落。"<p>思嘉笑了笑，感到有些莫名其妙。看着老太太把布满皱纹的脸凑了过来，她便顺从地轻轻吻了一下，虽然她不大明白老太太这番称赞是何用意，但她还是感到很高兴。</p>“你让苏伦嫁给一个下等人，虽然这里人人都喜欢威尔，可还是会有许多人要议论的。他们会异口同声说威尔是个好人，同时又说奥哈拉家的小姐尊下嫁多么可怕。不过这种话你也不必介意。"</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I’ve never bothered about what people said.”
<p>“So I’ve heard.” There was a hint of acid in the old voice. “Well, don’t bother about what folks say. It’ll probably be a very successful marriage. Of course, Will’s always going to look like a Cracker and marriage won’t improve his grammar any. And, even if he makes a mint of money, he’ll never lend any shine and sparkle to Tara, like your father did. Crackers are short on sparkle. But Will’s a gentleman at heart. He’s got the right instincts. Nobody but a born gentleman could have put his finger on what is wrong with us as accurately as he just did, down there at the burying. The whole world can’t lick us but we can lick ourselves by longing too hard for things we haven’t got any more—and by remembering too much. Yes, Will will do well by Suellen and by Tara.”</p>“Then you approve of me letting him marry her?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我从来不介意别人说些什么。"<p>“这我倒也有所耳闻，"老太太的语气里有点尖酸刻薄的味道。"不论人们议论什么，你别介意就是了。这门亲事说不定会很美满的。当然喽，威尔结婚以后也还是一副穷光蛋的样子，他的语法也不会有什么进步，他即使能赚上一大笔钱，也不可能像你父亲那样，为塔拉增添一分光彩。穷光蛋不可能有多少光彩的，不过威尔是个正直的人，他知道应该怎么办。刚才在坟地里，我们的想法全是错误的，只有像他这样一个天生正直的人才才能时加以纠正。世上没有什么东西能拿我们怎么样，可是我们自己要是老想恢复失去的东西，老想着过去，就会毁了我们自己。对苏伦来说，对塔拉来说，威尔的确是不错的。"</p>“这么说来，您是赞成我让他娶苏伦了？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“God, no!” The old voice was tired and bitter but vigorous. “Approve of Crackers marrying into old families? Bah! Would I approve of breeding scrub stock to thoroughbreds? Oh, Crackers are good and solid and honest but—”
<p>“But you said you thought it would be a successful match!” cried Scarlett bewildered.</p>“Oh, I think it’s good for Suellen to marry Will—to marry anybody for that matter, because she needs a husband bad. And where else could she get one? And where else could you get as good a manager for Tara? But that doesn’t mean I like the situation any better than you do.”
<p>But I do like it, thought Scarlett trying to grasp the old lady’s meaning. I’m glad Will is going to marry her. Why should she think I minded? She’s taking it for granted that I do mind, just like her.</p>She felt puzzled and a little ashamed, as always when people attributed to her emotions and motives they possessed and thought she shared.
</div>
  <div class="right">“不，"老太太用疲倦而痛苦的声音说，但语气很坚定。“赞成穷光蛋和名门世家通婚？不可能！我怎么能赞成让下等人和上等人结合呢？说起来，穷光蛋也是善良的，可靠的，诚实的，不过--"<p>“可是您刚才还说这门婚事可能会是美满的呀！"思嘉惊讶地说。</p>“唔，我认为苏伦嫁给威尔是件好事，其实她嫁给任何人都是件好事，因为她很需要有一个丈夫。到哪儿去找呢？你又到哪儿找这一个好管家，来照料塔拉呢？不过这不等于说我喜欢眼下这种状况，你不也一样吗？"<p>“可是我喜欢眼下这种状况，"思嘉一面想，一面琢磨着老太太的意思。"威尔娶苏份，我是高兴的。她为什么会认为我介意呢？她凭想像就认为我介意，她总是这样。"</p>思嘉感到莫名其妙，而且有点不好意思。别人把他们自己的情绪和想法强加于她，说她如何如何，她当然不理解，也不好意思。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Grandma fanned herself with her palmetto leaf and went on briskly: “I don’t approve of the match any more than you do but I’m practical and so are you. And when it comes to something that’s unpleasant but can’t be helped, I don’t see any sense in screaming and kicking about it. That’s no way to meet the ups and downs of life. I know because my family and the Old Doctor’s family have had more than our share of ups and downs. And if we folks have a motto, it’s this: ‘Don’t holler—smile and bide your time.’ We’ve survived a passel of things that way, smiling and biding our time, and we’ve gotten to be experts at surviving. We had to be. We’ve always bet on the wrong horses. Run out of France with the Huguenots, run out of England with the Cavaliers, run out of Scotland with Bonnie Prince Charlie, run out of Haiti by the niggers and now licked by the Yankees. But we always turn up on top in a few years. You know why?”</div>
  <div class="right">老太太扇着棕榈叶做的扇子，兴致十足地接着说：“我和你一样，也不赞成这桩婚事，但又讲究实际，你也一样。碰上不顺心的事，而又没有办法，喊叫哭闹都无济无事。这样一对付生活中的曲折是不行的。我们家和老大夫家经历的曲折比谁都多，所以我知道该怎么办。要说我们有什么格言，那就是：'不要喊叫只要笑，时机自然会来到。’许多难关，我们都是这样渡过的，一面笑，一面等待机会，我们已成了渡过难关的专家了。这也是不得已埃我们压宝总不到点子上。碰上胡格诺教派，我们逃出了法国，碰上查理一世的保王党，我们逃出了英格兰，碰上邦尼.普林斯.查理，我们逃出了苏格兰，碰上黑人，我们逃出了海地，现在又让北方佬给收拾了。可是每一次我们用不了几年就又出人头地了，你知道里面是什么缘故吗？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She cocked her head and Scarlett thought she looked like nothing so much as an old, knowing parrot.
<p>“No, I don’t know, I’m sure,” she answered politely. But she was heartily bored, even as she had been the day when Grandma launched on her memories of the Creek uprising.</p>“Well, this is the reason. We bow to the inevitable. We’re not wheat, we’re buckwheat! When a storm comes along it flattens ripe wheat because it’s dry and can’t bend with the wind. But ripe buckwheat’s got sap in it and it bends. And when the wind has passed, it springs up almost as straight and strong as before. We aren’t a stiff-necked tribe. We’re mighty limber when a hard wind’s blowing, because we know it pays to be limber. When trouble comes we bow to the inevitable without any mouthing, and we work and we smile and we bide our time. And we play along with lesser folks and we take what we can get from them. And when we’re strong enough, we kick the folks whose necks we’ve climbed over. That, my child, is the secret of the survival.” And after a pause, she added: “I pass it on to you.”
</div>
  <div class="right">说到这里，她把头一摇，思嘉觉得说她像一只懂事的老鹦鹉，真是再像不过了。<p>“我不知道，我真是不知道，"思嘉客平地回答说。不过她实在讨厌透了，和那天听老太太讲克里克人暴动的故事一样厌烦。</p>“那你就听我说。我们对不可能回避的事实总是低头的。我们不是小麦，而是荞麦。小麦熟了的时候，因为是干的，不能随风弯曲，风暴一来，就都倒了。荞麦熟了的时候，里面还会有水分，可以弯曲。大风过后，几乎可以和原来一样挺拔。我们不是挺着脖子硬干的那种人。刮大风的时候，我们是柔和顺从的，因为我们知道这样最有利，遇到困难，我们向无法回避的事情低头，而不需要大吵大闹，我们微笑，我们干活，这样来等待时机。等到我们有力量的时候，就把那些垫脚石踢开，这就是渡过难关的窍门，我的孩子。"她停了停又接着说：“现在我可把这穿门儿教给你了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The old lady cackled, as if she were amused by her words, despite the venom in them. She looked as if she expected some comment from Scarlett but the words had made little sense to her and she could think of nothing to say.
<p>“No, sir,” Old Miss went on, “our folks get flattened out but they rise up again, and that’s more than I can say for plenty of people not so far away from here. Look at Cathleen Calvert. You can see what she’s come to. Poor white! And a heap lower than the man she married. Look at the McRae family. Flat to the ground, helpless, don’t know what to do, don’t know how to do anything. Won’t even try. They spend their time whining about the good old days. And look at—well, look at nearly anybody in this County except my Alex and my Sally and you and Jim Tarleton and his girls and some others. The rest have gone under because they didn’t have any sap in them, because they didn’t have the gumption to rise up again. There never was anything to those folks but money and darkies, and now that the money and darkies are gone, those folks will be Cracker in another generation.”</p>“You forgot the Wilkes.”
</div>
  <div class="right">老太太说罢，大声地笑起来，虽然她的话相当恶毒，她却好像觉得十分有趣，看样子她以为思嘉会对她的话有所评论，可是思嘉还不大理解她这番话，一时也没有什么好说。<p>“你没看见。"老太太继续说，"我们的人倒了就会爬起来，可是左近有许多人就不是这样。就拿凯瑟琳.卡尔弗特来说吧。你看她成了什么样子，成了穷人。比她嫁的那个男人寒酸多了。再看看麦克雷一家，也穷困潦倒，一筹莫展，一天到晚唉声叹气，惋惜过去的好日子。不知道干什么好，什么也不会干，而且也不想干，再来看看--哎，左邻右舍看谁都一样，除了我们的亚历克斯和萨莉，除了你和吉姆.塔尔顿，还有他的几个女儿和另外几个人，别的人都倒下了，他们身缺少那种水分，也缺乏重新站起来的勇气，这些人只知道钱，只知道黑奴，现在钱没有了，黑奴也没有了，他们也成了一伙穷光蛋了。"</p>“你忘了威尔克斯一家了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“No, I didn’t forget them. I just thought I’d be polite and not mention them, seeing that Ashley’s a guest under this roof. But seeing as how you’ve brought up their names—look at them! There’s India who from all I hear is a dried-up old maid already, giving herself all kinds of widowed airs because Stu Tarleton was killed and not making any effort to forget him and try to catch another man. Of course, she’s old but she could catch some widower with a big family if she tried. And poor Honey was always a man-crazy fool with no more sense than a guinea hen. And as for Ashley, look at him!”</div>
  <div class="right">“不，我没有忘记，我想为了礼貌起见，就没有提他们，因为艾希礼是你们家的客人呀。你既然提到他们，就来看看他们的情况吧。那个英迪亚，听说她已经成了一个干瘪的老太婆，因为斯图尔特.塔尔顿被打死了，她就十足一副寡妇的神气，既不想把他忘掉，也不想再嫁人。她的年纪已经不小了，不过她要是想找，还可以找一个死了老婆，带着一大帮孩子的人嘛。那可怜的霍妮想找个男人都快想疯了，呆头呆脑像只老母鸡。至于艾希礼，瞧他那副样子！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Ashley is a very fine man,” began Scarlett hotly.
<p>“I never said he wasn’t but he’s as helpless as a turtle on his back. If the Wilkes family pulls through these hard times, it’ll be Melly who pulls them through. Not Ashley.”</p>“Melly! Lord, Grandma! What are you talking about? I’ve lived with Melly long enough to know she’s sickly and scared and hasn’t the gumption to say Boo to a goose.”
<p>“Now why on earth should anyone want to say Boo to a goose? It always sounded like a waste of time to me. She might not say Boo to a goose but she’d say Boo to the world or the Yankee government or anything else that threatened her precious Ashley or her boy or her notions of gentility. Her way isn’t your way, Scarlett, or my way. It’s the way your mother would have acted if she’d lived. Melly puts me in mind of your mother when she was young. ... And maybe she’ll pull the Wilkes family through.”</p>“Oh, Melly’s a well-meaning little ninny. But you are very unjust to Ashley. He’s—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“艾希礼可是个好人，"思嘉顶了她一句。<p>“我从来没说他不是好人，可他好比四脚朝天的乌龟，一点办法也没有。要是威尔克斯一家人能顺利渡过眼前这难关，他们靠的是媚兰，而不是艾希礼。"</p>“媚兰！我的天！老太太，您在说些什么？我和她在一起生活过，对她有所了解，她弱不禁风，胆小怕事，连对鹅吆喝一声的勇气都没有。"<p>“现在有谁会想对鹅吆喝呢？我总觉得这完全是浪费时间。媚兰也许不敢对鹅吆喝，可是无论什么事情要是威胁到她那可爱的艾希礼，她的儿子，或者她对文明行为的信仰，哪怕是整个世界，哪怕是北方佬的政府，她都敢冲着它大声嚷嚷。她的做法和你不同，也和我不同，思嘉。你母亲要是还活着，她也会这样做。媚兰使我想起你母亲年轻的时候。……她也许能使威尔克斯一家顺利地渡过难关。"</p>“唔，媚兰是个好心的小傻瓜，可是你对艾希礼太不公平了。他--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Oh, foot! Ashley was bred to read books and nothing else. That doesn’t help a man pull himself out of a tough fix, like we’re all in now. From what I hear, he’s the worst plow hand in the County! Now you just compare him with my Alex! Before the war, Alex was the most worthless dandy in the world and he never had a thought beyond a new cravat and getting drunk and shooting somebody and chasing girls who were no better than they should be. But look at him now! He learned farming because he had to learn. He’d have starved and so would all of us. Now he raises the best cotton in the County—yes, Miss! It’s a heap better than Tara cotton!—and he knows what to do with hogs and chickens. Ha! He’s a fine boy for all his bad temper. He knows how to bide his time and change with changing ways and when all this Reconstruction misery is over, you’re going to see my Alex as rich a man as his father and his grandfather were. But Ashley—”</div>
  <div class="right">“哎哟！艾希礼除了会看书，别的什么都不行，碰上目前这种困难，他是无法摆脱的。我听说，他在本地干农活干得最差。你只要把他和我们家的亚历克斯比一比就可看得出了，没打仗的时候，亚历克是个最无聊的花花公子，一心想弄条新领带，要不就喝得烂醉，或者朝人乱开枪，或者追那些不怎么样的女孩子。可他现在怎么样了呢？他学会了种地，不学是不行。不学就得饿死，我们全都得饿死。他在这带种棉花是种得最好的。小姐，的确是这样，比塔拉的棉花好多了。养猪，养鸡，他什么都很在行。别看他脾气不好，他可是个好小伙子啊，他知道怎样等待时机，随机应变。等这艰苦的恢复时期一过，你就等着瞧吧，我那亚历克斯马上就会阔起来，和他父亲和祖父一样有钱，而艾希礼呢--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett was smarting at the slight to Ashley.
<p>“It all sounds like tootle to me,” she said coldly.</p>“Well, it shouldn’t,” said Grandma, fastening a sharp eye upon her. “For it’s just exactly the course you’ve been following since you went to Atlanta. Oh, yes! We hear of your didoes, even if we are buried down here in the country. You’ve changed with the changing times too. We hear how you suck up to the Yankees and the white trash and the new-rich Carpetbaggers to get money out of them. Butter doesn’t melt in your mouth from all I can hear. Well, go to it, I say. And get every cent out of them you can, but when you’ve got enough money, kick them in the face, because they can’t serve you any longer. Be sure you do that and do it properly, for trash hanging onto your coat tails can ruin you.”
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉听她这样贬低艾希礼，感到很难过。“我觉得这都是些无稽之谈。"她冷淡地说。“怕不见得吧，"老太太一面说，一面用两眼使劲盯住她。“自从你去了亚特兰大，你走的就是这么一条路。真的，别看我们待在乡下，我耍的那些手段我们也都听到了。时代变了，你也跟着变了。我们听说你讨好北方佬，讨好穷白人，还讨好从北方来的冒险家，从他们身上骗取钱财。我还听说你装得一本正经，就这么干下去吧。把他们的钱都刮出来，一个子也别剩。等你刮够了，他们不能再为你效劳了。就把他们一脚踢开。你一定要这样做，而且要做好，要是让那些穷鬼沾上你，你可就完了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett looked at her, her brow wrinkling with the effort to digest the words. They still didn’t make much sense and she was still angry at Ashley being called a turtle on his back.
<p>“I think you’re wrong about Ashley,” she said abruptly.</p>“Scarlett, you just aren’t smart.”
<p>“That’s your opinion,” said Scarlett rudely, wishing it were permissible to smack old ladies’ jaws.</p>“Oh, you’re smart enough about dollars and cents. That’s a man’s way of being smart. But you aren’t smart at all like a woman. You aren’t a speck smart about folks.”
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉两眼盯着她，双眉紧皱，揣摩她这番话的意思，她还是不大明白，而且对老太太把艾希礼描画成四脚朝天的乌龟仍然余怒未消。<p>“我觉得您这样说艾希礼是不对的。"她突然说。</p>“思嘉，你好胡涂埃”<p>“那是您的看法，”思嘉狠狠地说，恨不得上去给她一记耳光。</p>“要是说起几块钱，几毛钱，你是够精明的，不过那是男人精明。而你作为女人却一点也不精明。和人打交道，你可不能算精明。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett’s eyes began to snap fire and her hands to clench and unclench.
<p>“I’ve made you good and mad, haven’t I?” asked the old lady, smiling. “Well, I aimed to do just that.”</p>“Oh, you did, did you? And why, pray?”
<p>“I had good and plenty reasons.”</p>Grandma sank back in her chair and Scarlett suddenly realized that she looked very tired and incredibly old. The tiny clawlike hands folded over the fan were yellow and waxy as a dead person’s. The anger went out of Scarlett’s heart as a thought came to her. She leaned over and took one of the hands in hers.
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉听到这话，顿时两眼冒火，两只手不停地攥拳头。<p>“我把你惹火了，是不是？"老太太笑着问。"我是故意这样做的。"</p>“啊，是吗？请问这是为什么呢？"<p>“理由很多呀。"</p>老太太往后一仰，靠在椅背上。这时思嘉突然感到老太太很累，而且显得特别衰老。两只鸡爪般的小手交叉着搭在扇子上，黄得像蜡做的，和死人的手一样，思嘉想到这，怒气全消失了，她往前凑了凑，双手抓起老太太的一只手。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“You’re a mighty sweet old liar,” she said. “You didn’t mean a word of all this rigmarole. You’ve just been talking to keep my mind off Pa, haven’t you?”
<p>“Don’t fiddle with me!” said Old Miss grumpily, Jerking away her hand. “Partly for that reason, partly because what I’ve been telling you is the truth and you’re just too stupid to realize it.”</p>But she smiled a little and took the sting from her words. Scarlett’s heart emptied itself of wrath about Ashley. It was nice to know Grandma hadn’t meant any of it.
<p>“Thank you, just the same. It was nice of you to talk to me—and I’m glad to know you’re with me about Will and Suellen, even if—even if a lot of other people do disapprove.”</p>Mrs. Tarleton came down the hall, carrying two glasses of buttermilk. She did all domestic things badly and the glasses were slopping over.
</div>
  <div class="right">“您真会装蒜，"思嘉说。"您唠叨了半天，并没有一句真心话。您不停地说，是不是让我想我爸爸，是不是？"<p>“你别瞎摩挲！"老太太毫不客气地说，一面把手抽回来。“不单是这个原因，还因为我的话有道理，只是你太笨，不能领会罢了。"</p>思嘉听了这讽刺的话并不介意，笑了笑。刚才她心里还为老太太说艾希礼的话生气，现在这气已经全消了。她意识到老太太说话并没有当回事，感到很高兴。<p>“我还是要谢谢您，您和我谈话，对我真关心。关于威尔和苏伦的事，您同意我的意见，我感到很高兴，虽然--虽然许多人是不赞成的。"</p>这时，塔尔顿太太顺着过道走来，手里端着两杯脱脂牛奶。她什么家务事都不会干，连端两杯奶都洒出来了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I had to go clear to the spring house to get it,” she said. “Drink it quick because the folks are coming up from the burying ground. Scarlett, are you really going to let Suellen marry Will? Not that he isn’t a sight too good for her but you know he is a Cracker and—”
<p>Scarlett’s eyes met those of Grandma. There was a wicked sparkle in the old eyes that found an answer in her own.</p></div>
  <div class="right">“我一直跑到冷藏室才弄到这两杯奶，"她说：“快喝了吧，他们马上就从坟地到这儿来了，思嘉，你真要让苏伦嫁给威尔吗？我不是说威尔和她不般配，你要知道，他可是个穷光蛋呀。而且--"<p>思嘉和老太太互相递了个眼色，老太太的眼神里充满讥讽的意思，思嘉的眼神里也有同样的意思。</p></div></div>
