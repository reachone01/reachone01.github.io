  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">ONE RAINY AFTERNOON when Bonnie was barely past her first birthday, Wade moped about the sitting room, occasionally going to the window and flattening his nose on the dripping pane. He was a slender, weedy boy, small for his eight years, quiet almost to shyness, never speaking unless spoken to. He was bored and obviously at loss for entertainment, for Ella was busy in the corner with her dolls, Scarlett was at her secretary muttering to herself as she added a long column of figures, and Rhett was lying on the floor, swinging his watch by its chain, just out of Bonnie’s reach.</div>
  <div class="right">一个雨天的下午，那时邦妮刚刚过了她的周岁生日，韦德闷闷不乐地在起居室里来回走动，偶尔到窗口去将鼻子紧贴在水淋淋的窗玻璃上。他是个瘦小而孱弱的孩子，虽然八岁了，但个子很矮，文静得到了羞怯的地步，除非别人跟他说话，否则是从来不开口的。他显然感到无聊，想不出什么好玩的事，因为爱拉正在一个角落里忙着摆弄她的玩具娃娃，思嘉坐在写字台前算账，要将一长串数字加起来，嘴里不停地嘀嘀咕咕着，而瑞德则躺在地板上，用两个手指捏着表链将表在邦妮面前晃荡，可是又不让她抓着。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">After Wade had picked up several books and let them drop with bangs and sighed deeply, Scarlett turned to him in irritation.
<p>“Heavens, Wade! Run out and play.”</p>“I can’t. It’s raining.”
<p>“Is it? I hadn’t noticed. Well, do something. You make me nervous, fidgeting about. Go tell Pork to hitch up the carriage and take you over to play with Beau.”</p>“He isn’t home,” sighed Wade. “He’s at Raoul Picard’s birthday party.”
</div>
  <div class="right">韦德翻出几本书来，但每次拿起一本又立即啪地一声丢下，一面还连连地叹气，这样接连好几次，惹得思嘉恼怒地转过身来。<p>“天哪，韦德！你到外面玩去吧。”</p>“不行。外面在下雨呢。”<p>“真的吗？我怎么没注意到。那么，找点事做吧。你老是坐立不安，把我烦死了。去告诉波克，让他套车送你到那边跟小博一起玩去。"</p>“他不在家，"韦德丧气地说。"他去参加拉乌尔.皮卡德的生日宴会去了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Raoul was the small son of Maybelle and René Picard—a detestable little brat, Scarlett thought, more like an ape than a child.
<p>“Well, you can go to see anyone you want to. Run tell Pork.”</p>“Nobody’s at home,” answered Wade. “Everybody’s at the party.”
<p>The unspoken words “everybody—but me” hung in the air; but Scarlett, her mind on her account books, paid no heed.</p>Rhett raised himself to a sitting posture and said: “Why aren’t you at the party too, son?”
</div>
  <div class="right">拉乌尔是梅贝尔和雷内.皮卡德生的小儿子，思嘉觉得他很讨厌，与其说是小孩还不如说是个小猴儿呢。<p>“那么，你高兴去看谁就去看谁吧。快去告诉波克。"</p>“谁都不在家，"韦德回答。"人人都参加那个宴会了。"<p>韦德没有说出来的那几个字"人人--除了我"是谁都察觉得到的，可是思嘉聚精会神在算帐，根本没有在意。</p>瑞德将身子坐起来，说：“那你为什么没去参加宴会呢。儿子？”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Wade edged closer to him, scuffing one foot and looking unhappy.
<p>“I wasn’t invited, sir.”</p>Rhett handed his watch into Bonnie’s destructive grasp and rose lightly to his feet.
<p>“Leave those damned figures alone, Scarlett. Why wasn’t Wade invited to this party?”</p>“For Heaven’s sake, Rhett! Don’t bother me now. Ashley has gotten these accounts in an awful snarl— Oh, that party? Well, I think it’s nothing unusual that Wade wasn’t invited and I wouldn’t let him go if he had been. Don’t forget that Raoul is Mrs. Merriwether’s grandchild and Mrs. Merriwether would as soon have a free issue nigger in her sacred parlor as one of us.”
</div>
  <div class="right">韦德向他靠近些，一只脚在地板上擦来擦去，显得很不高兴。<p>“我没接到邀请，先生。”</p>瑞德把他的表放在邦妮那只专门摔坏东西的小手里，然后轻轻地站起身来。<p>“丢下这些该死的数字吧，思嘉。为什么韦德没有被邀请去参加那个宴会呢？"</p>“看在上帝面上，瑞德！你现在别来打搅我了。艾希礼把这些帐目搞得一塌糊涂--唔，那个宴会？唔，我看人家不请韦德也没有什么，假如请了他，我还不让他去呢。别忘了拉乌尔是梅里韦瑟太太的孙子，而梅里韦瑟太太是宁愿让一个自由黑人也不会让我们家的人到她那神圣的客厅里去的呀！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Rhett, watching Wade’s face with meditative eyes, saw the boy flinch.
<p>“Come here, son,” he said, drawing the boy to him. “Would you like to be at that party?”</p>“No, sir,” said Wade bravely but his eyes fell.
<p>“Hum. Tell me, Wade, do you go to little Joe Whiting’s parties or Frank Bonnell’s or—well, any of your playmates?”</p>“No, sir. I don’t get invited to many parties.”
</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德若有所思地注视着韦德那张小脸，发现这孩子在难过。<p>“到这里来，儿子，"他边说，边把孩子拉过来。"你想去参加那个宴会吗？”</p>“不，先生，"韦德勇敢地说，但同时他的眼睛往下看了。<p>“嗯。告诉我，韦德，你去参加小乔.惠廷或者弗兰克.邦内尔，或者-—唔，别的小朋友的生日宴会吗？"</p>“不先生。许多宴会我都没有接到邀请呢。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Wade, you are lying!” cried Scarlett, turning. “You went to three last week, the Bart children’s party and the Gelerts’ and the Hundons’.”
<p>“As choice a collection of mules in horse harness as you could group together,” said Rhett, his voice going into a soft drawl. “Did you have a good time at those parties? Speak up.”</p>“No, sir.”
<p>“Why not?”</p>“I—I dunno, sir. Mammy—Mammy says they’re white trash.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“韦德，你撒谎！"思嘉回过头来喊道。"你上星期就参加了三次，巴特家孩子们的宴会，盖勒特家的宴会和亨登家的宴会。"<p>“你这是骡子身上配了一套马笼头，把什么都拉到一起来了。"瑞德说，接着他的声音渐渐变温和了，又问韦德：“你在那些宴会上感到高兴吗？你只管说。"</p>"不，先生。”<p>“为什么不呢？"</p>“我--我不知道，先生。嬷嬷--嬷嬷说他们是些坏白人。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I’ll skin Mammy this minute!” cried Scarlett, leaping to her feet “And as for you, Wade, talking so about Mother’s friends—”
<p>“The boy’s telling the truth and so is Mammy,” said Rhett. “But, of course, you’ve never been able to know the truth if you met it in the road. ... Don’t bother, son. You don’t have to go to any more parties you don’t want to go to. Here,” he pulled a bill from his pocket, “tell Pork to harness the carriage and take you downtown. Buy yourself some candy—a lot, enough to give you a wonderful stomach ache.”</p>Wade, beaming, pocketed the bill and looked anxiously toward his mother for confirmation. But she, with a pucker in her brows, was watching Rhett. He had picked Bonnie from the floor and was cradling her to him, her small face against his cheek. She could not read his face but there was something in his eyes almost like fear—fear and self-accusation.
</div>
  <div class="right">“我立刻就要剥她的皮，这个嬷嬷！”思嘉跳起来高大叫。“至于你嘛，韦德你这样说你母亲的朋友--"<p>“孩子说的是实话，嬷嬷也是这样，"瑞德说。"不过，当然喽，你是从来都不会认识真理的。即使你在大路上碰到了……别难过。儿子，你用不着再去参加你不想去的宴会了。给，"他从口袋里掏出一张钞票给他，"去告诉波克，套马车带你去街上去玩。给我自己买些糖果--买多多的，不要怕吃得肚子太痛了。"</p>韦德开心了，把钞票塞进口袋，然后焦急地看着他母亲，希望能征得她的同意。可思嘉正蹙着眉头在看瑞德。这时他已从地板上把邦妮抱起来，让她偎在他怀里，小脸紧贴着他的面颊，她看不到他脸上的表情，但发现他眼睛里有一种近乎忧虑的神色--忧虑和自责的神色。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Wade, encouraged by his stepfather’s generosity, came shyly toward him.
<p>“Uncle Rhett, can I ask you sumpin’?”</p>“Of course.” Rhett’s look was anxious, absent, as he held Bonnie’s head closer. “What is it, Wade?”
<p>“Uncle Rhett, were you—did you fight in the war?”</p>Rhett’s eyes came alertly back and they were sharp, but his voice was casual.
</div>
  <div class="right">韦德从继父的慷慨中得到了鼓励，羞涩地走到他跟前。<p>“瑞德伯伯，我可以问你一件事吗？”</p>“当然可以。"瑞德的神情有点不安，但又好像满不在乎似的，他把邦妮的头抱得更靠近一些。"什么事，韦德？"<p>“瑞德伯伯，你是不是--你在战争中打过仗吗？"</p>瑞德的眼睛警觉地往后一缩，但还是犀利的，不过声音有点犹豫了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Why do you ask, son?”
<p>“Well, Joe Whitling said you didn’t and so did Frankie Bonnell.”</p>“Ah,” said Rhett, “and what did you tell them?”
<p>Wade looked unhappy.</p>“I—I said—I told them I didn’t know.” And with a rush, “But I didn’t care and I hit them. Were you in the war, Uncle Rhett?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你干吗问这个呀，儿子？”<p>“嗯，乔.惠廷说你没有打过，弗兰克.邦内尔也这样说。"</p>“哎，"瑞德说，“那你对他们怎么说呢？"<p>韦德看起来有点不高兴。</p>“我--我说--我告诉他们我不知道。"接着赶忙补充，“不过我并不在乎，而且我揍了他们。你参加战争了吗，瑞德伯伯？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Yes,” said Rhett, suddenly violent “I was in the war. I was in the army for eight months. I fought all the way from Lovejoy up to Franklin, Tennessee. And I was with Johnston when he surrendered.”
<p>Wade wriggled with pride but Scarlett laughed.</p>“I thought you were ashamed of your war record,” she said. “Didn’t you tell me to keep it quiet?”
<p>“Hush,” he said briefly. “Does that satisfy you, Wade?”</p>“Oh, yes, sir! I knew you were in the war. I knew you weren’t scared like they said. But—why weren’t you with the other little boys’ fathers?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“参加了，“瑞德说，突然变得厉害起来。"我参加过战争。我在军队里待了八个月。我从洛夫乔伊一直打到田纳西的富兰克林，约翰斯顿投降时我还在他的部队里。"<p>韦德高兴得扭摆起来，但是思嘉笑了。</p>“我以为你会对自己的战争史感到羞耻呢，"她说。"你不是还叫我不要对别人说吗？”<p>“嘘！"他阻止她。"韦德，你现在满意了吧？"</p>"啊，是的，先生！我本来就知道你参加了战争。我知道你不会像他们说的胆小如鼠。不过--你为什么没有跟别的小朋友的父亲在一起呀？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Because the other little boys’ fathers were such fools they had to put them in the infantry. I was a West Pointer and so I was in the artillery. In the regular artillery, Wade, not the Home Guard. It takes a pile of sense to be in the artillery, Wade.”
<p>“I bet,” said Wade, his face shining. “Did you get wounded, Uncle Rhett?’</p>Rhett hesitated.
<p>“Tell him about your dysentery,” jeered Scarlett.</p>Rhett carefully set the baby on the floor and pulled his shirt and undershirt out of his trouser band.
</div>
  <div class="right">“因为别的孩子的父亲都些笨蛋，他们给编到步兵队里去了。我从前是西点军校的学生，所以编在炮兵队里。是在正规的炮兵队，韦德，不是乡团。要进炮兵队可不简单呢，韦德。"<p>“我想准是那样，"韦德说，他的脸都发亮了。"你受过伤吗，瑞德伯伯。"</p>瑞德迟疑着。<p>“把你的痢疾讲给他听听吧。"思嘉挖苦地说。</p>瑞德小心地把孩子放在地板上，然后把他的衬衣和汗衫从裤腰事带里拉出来。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Come here, Wade, and I’ll show you where I was wounded.”
<p>Wade advanced, excited, and gazed where Rhett’s finger pointed. A long raised scar ran across his brown chest and down into his heavily muscled abdomen. It was the souvenir of a knife fight in the California gold fields but Wade did not know it. He breathed heavily and happily.</p>“I guess you’re ‘bout as brave as my father, Uncle Rhett.”
<p>“Almost but not quite,” said Rhett, stuffing his shirt into his trousers. “Now, go on and spend your dollar and whale hell out of any boy who says I wasn’t in the army.”</p>Wade went dancing out happily, calling to Pork, and Rhett picked up the baby again.
</div>
  <div class="right">“过来，韦德，我给你看我受伤的地方。"<p>韦德激动地走上前去，注视着瑞德用手指指着的地方。一道长长的隆起伤疤越过褐色的胸脯一直伸到肌肉发达的腹部底下。那是他在加利福妮亚金矿区跟别人打架动刀子留下来的一个纪念。但是韦德搞不清楚，他呼吸紧张，心里十分骄傲。</p>“我猜你大概跟我父亲一样勇敢，瑞德伯伯。"<p>“差不多，但也不全一样，"瑞德说，一面把衬衣塞进裤腰里，"好了，现在带着那一块钱出去花吧，以后再有哪个孩子说我没打过仗，就给我狠狠揍他。"</p>韦德高兴得蹦蹦跳跳地出去了，一路喊叫着波克，同时瑞德又把孩子抱起来。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Now why all these lies, my gallant soldier laddie?” asked Scarlett.
<p>“A boy has to be proud of his father—or stepfather. I can’t let him be ashamed before the other little brutes. Cruel creatures, children.”</p>“Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!”
<p>“I never thought about what it meant to Wade,” said Rhett slowly. “I never thought how he’s suffered. And it’s not going to be that way for Bonnie.”</p>“What way?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你干么撒这些谎呢，我的英勇的大兵少爷？”思嘉问。<p>“一个男孩子总得为他父亲--或者继父感到骄傲嘛。我不能让他在别的小鬼面前觉得不光彩。孩子们，真是些冷酷的小家伙。"</p>“啊，胡说八道！"<p>“我以前从来没想过这跟韦德有什么关系，"瑞德慢腾腾地说。"我从没想过他会那样烦恼，不过将来邦妮不会碰到这种情况了。"</p>“什么情况？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Do you think I’m going to have my Bonnie ashamed of her father? Have her left out of parties when she’s nine or ten? Do you think I’m going to have her humiliated like Wade for things that aren’t her fault but yours and mine?”
<p>“Oh, children’s parties!”</p>“Out of children’s parties grow young girls’ début parties. Do you think I’m going to let my daughter grow up outside of everything decent in Atlanta? I’m not going to send her North to school and to visit because she won’t be accepted here or in Charleston or Savannah or New Orleans. And I’m not going to see her forced to marry a Yankee or a foreigner because no decent Southern family will have her—because her mother was a fool and her father a blackguard.”
<p>Wade, who had come back to the door, was an interested but puzzled listener.</p>“Bonnie can marry Beau, Uncle Rhett.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“你以为我会让邦妮为她父亲感到羞愧吗？到她九岁或十岁时，难道也只能一个人待着不去参加那些集体活动？你以为让也像韦德那样，不是由于她自己的过错而是由于你和我的过错，便受到委屈吗？"<p>“唔，孩子们的宴会嘛！"</p>“年轻姑娘们最初的社交活动就是子孩子们的宴会中培养出来的呀。你以为我会让我的女儿完全置身于亚特兰大上流社会之外。关在家里长成起来吗？我不会因为她在这里或查尔斯顿或萨凡纳或新奥尔良不受欢迎，就送她到北方去上学或者访问的。我也不会因为没有哪个体面的南方家庭要她--因为她母亲是个傻瓜，她父亲是个无赖，而让她被迫嫁一个北方佬或一个外国人的。"<p>这时韦德返回家，站在门口，十分感兴趣而又迷惑不解地听着。</p>“邦妮可以跟小博结婚嘛，瑞德伯伯。”</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The anger went from Rhett’s face as he turned to the little boy, and he considered his words with apparent seriousness as he always did when dealing with the children.
<p>“That’s true, Wade. Bonnie can marry Beau Wilkes, but who will you marry?”</p>“Oh, I shan’t marry anyone,” said Wade confidently, luxuriating in a man-to-man talk with the one person, except Aunt Melly, who never reproved and always encouraged him. “I’m going to go to Harvard and be a lawyer, like my father, and then I’m going to be a brave soldier just like him.”
</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德转过身去看这个小孩，脸上的怒气全消了74 ，他显然在严肃地考虑孩子的话，这是他2对待孩子们的一贯态度。<p>“这倒是真的，韦德，邦妮可以嫁给博.威尔克斯，可是你又跟谁结婚呢？”</p>“唔，我跟谁也不结，"韦德挺自豪地说，他十分高兴能同这个人平等地谈话，这是除媚兰以外惟一的一个人，他从不责怪他，反而经常鼓励他。"我将来要上哈佛大大，学当律师，像我父亲那样，然后我要做一个像他那样勇敢的军人。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I wish Melly would keep her mouth shut,” cried Scarlett. “Wade, you are not going to Harvard. It’s a Yankee school and I won’t have you going to a Yankee school. You are going to the University of Georgia and after you graduate you are going to manage the store for me. And as for your father being a brave soldier—”
<p>“Hush,” said Rhett curtly, not missing the shining light in Wade’s eyes when he spoke of the father he had never known. “You grow up and be a brave man like your father, Wade. Try to be just like him, for he was a hero and don’t let anyone tell you differently. He married your mother, didn’t he? Well, that’s proof enough of heroism. And I’ll see that you go to Harvard and become a lawyer. Now, run along and tell Pork to take you to town.”</p>“I’ll thank you to let me manage my children,” cried Scarlett as Wade obediently trotted from the room.
</div>
  <div class="right">“我但愿媚兰闭住她那张嘴才好，"思嘉大声喊道。"韦德，你将来不上哈佛大学。那是一所北方佬的学校，我可不希望你到那儿去念书。你将来上佐治亚大学，毕业后约我经营那个店铺，至于说你父亲是个勇敢的军人嘛--”<p>“嘘，"瑞德不让她说下去，因为他发现韦德说起他那们从未见过的父亲时眼睛里闪烁着光辉。"韦德，你长大了要成为一个像你父样那勇敢的人。正是要像他那样，因为他是个英雄；要是有人说的不一样，你可不要答应呀。他跟你母亲结婚了，不是吗？所以，这也证明他是个有英雄气概的人了。我会自豪看到你去哈佛大学，学当律师。好，现在叫波克，让他带你去上街吧。”</p>“谢谢你了，请让我自己来管教我的孩子吧。"思嘉等韦德一出门便嚷嚷开了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“You’re a damned poor manager. You’ve wrecked whatever chances Ella and Wade had, but I won’t permit you to do Bonnie that way. Bonnie’s going to be a little princess and everyone in the world is going to want her. There’s not going to be any place she can’t go. Good God, do you think I’m going to let her grow up and associate with the riffraff that fills this house?”
<p>“They are good enough for you—”</p>“And a damned sight too good for you, my pet. But not for Bonnie. Do you think I’d let her marry any of this runagate gang you spend your time with? Irishmen on the make, Yankees, white trash, Carpetbag parvenus— My Bonnie with her Butler blood and her Robillard strain—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“让你去管教才糟糕呢！"你如今已经把韦德和爱拉全给耽误，我可决不让你那样对待邦妮！邦妮将来要成为一个小公主，世界上所有的人都喜欢她。她没有什么地方不能去的。我的上帝，你以为我会让她长大以后跟这个家里那些来来往往的下流坯打交道吗？"<p>"对于你来说，他们已经不错的了--"</p>“对于你才他妈的太好了，我的宝贝儿。可是对邦妮不行。你以为我会让她跟一个你整天厮混的那帮流浪汉结婚吗？损人利己的爱尔兰人，北方佬，坏白人，提包党暴发户--我的出自巴特勒血统和罗毕拉德门的邦妮--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The O’Haras—”
<p>"The O’Haras might have been kings of Ireland once but your father was nothing but a smart Mick on the make. And you are no better— But then, I’m at fault too. I’ve gone through life like a bat out of hell, never caring what I did, because nothing ever mattered to me. But Bonnie matters. God, what a fool I’ve been! Bonnie wouldn’t be received in Charleston, no matter what my mother or your Aunt Eulalie or Aunt Pauline did—and it’s obvious that she won’t be received here unless we do something quickly—”</p>“Oh, Rhett, you take it so seriously you’re funny. With our money—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“还有奥哈拉家族--"<p>“奥哈拉家族曾经有可能成为爱尔兰的王室，可你父亲只不过是个损人利己的精明的爱尔兰农民罢了。你也好不了多少--不过嘛，我也有错。我像一只从地狱里飞出来的蝙蝠似的混过了前半生，为所欲为，对一切满不在乎。可是邦妮不能这样，关系大着呢。天哪，我以前多么愚蠢！邦妮在查尔斯顿不会受到欢迎，无论我的母亲或你的尤拉莉姨妈或波琳姨妈如何努力--而且很显然，要是我们不赶快采取行动，她在这里也会站不住脚的。”</p>“唔，瑞德，你把问题看得那么严重，真有意思！我们有了这么多钱--"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Damn our money! All our money can’t buy what I want for her. I’d rather Bonnie was invited to eat dry bread in the Picards’ miserable house or Mrs. Elsing’s rickety barn than to be the belle of a Republican inaugural ball. Scarlett, you’ve been a fool. You should have insured a place for your children in the social scheme years ago—but you didn’t. You didn’t even bother to keep what position you had. And it’s too much to hope that you’ll mend your ways at this late date. You’re too anxious to make money and too fond of bullying people.”</div>
  <div class="right">“让这些钱见鬼去吧！用我们所有的钱也买不到我要给她的东西呀！我宁肯让邦妮被邀请到皮卡德的破房子里呀埃尔辛太太家里那摇摇晃晃的仓房里去啃干面包，也不让她去当共和党人就职舞会上的明星。你了太笨了。你应该早就给孩子们在社会上准备一个位置的--可是你没有。你甚至连自己原来占有的位置也没有留心保祝所以事到如今，要你改正自己的为人处世之道也实在太难了。你太热衷于赚钱，太喜欢欺负人了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I consider this whole affair a tempest in a teapot,” said Scarlett coldly, rattling her papers to indicate that as far as she was concerned the discussion was finished.
<p>“We have only Mrs. Wilkes to help us and you do your best to alienate and insult her. Oh, spare me your remarks about her poverty and her tacky clothes. She’s the soul and the center of everything in Atlanta that’s sterling. Thank God for her. She’ll help me do something about it.”</p>“And what are you going to do?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我看整个这件事情就是茶壶里的风暴，小题大作，"思嘉冷冰冰地说，同时把手里的帐本翻得哗哗响，意思是对她来说这场讨论已经结束了。<p>“我们只能得到威尔克斯太太的帮助，可你偏偏在尽力疏远她，侮辱她。唔，求求你不要在我面前诉说她的贫穷和褴褛了。只有她才是亚特兰大一切精华和灵魂的核心呢。感谢上帝把她给了我们。她会在这方面给我帮助的。"</p>“那你准备怎么办呢？"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Do? I’m going to cultivate every female dragon of the Old Guard in this town, especially Mrs. Merriwether, Mrs. Elsing, Mrs. Whiting and Mrs. Meade. If I have to crawl on my belly to every fat old cat who hates me, I’ll do it. I’ll be meek under their coldness and repentant of my evil ways. I’ll contribute to their damned charities and I’ll go to their damned churches. I’ll admit and brag about my services to the Confederacy and, if worst comes to worst, I’ll join their damned Klan—though a merciful God could hardly lay so heavy a penance on my shoulders as that. And I shall not hesitate to remind the fools whose necks I saved that they owe me a debt. And you, Madam, will kindly refrain from undoing my work behind my back and foreclosing mortgages on any of the people I’m courting or selling them rotten lumber or in other ways insulting them. And Governor Bullock never sets foot in this house again. Do you hear? And none of this gang of elegant thieves you’ve been associating with, either. If you do invite them, over my request, you will find yourself in the embarrassing position of having no host in your home. If they come in this house, I will spend the time in Belle Watling’s bar telling anyone who cares to hear that I won’t stay under the same roof with them.”</div>
  <div class="right">“怎么办？我要给这个城市里每一们保守派的女头目做工作，尤其是梅里韦瑟太太、埃尔辛太太、惠廷庆庆和米德太太。即使我必须五体投地爬到每一位恨我的胖老猫面前去，我也心甘情愿。我愿意乖乖地忍受她们的奚落，忏悔我过去的恶行。我愿意给她们那些该死的慈善事业捐款，愿意到她们的鬼教堂里去做礼拜。我愿意承认并且吹嘘我给南部联盟做的种种事情，而且，如果万不得已，我愿意加入他妈的那个三Ｋ党--尽管上帝不见得会那样无情，将对我作出这种残酷的惩罚。而且我会毫不犹豫地提醒那些我曾经挽救过他们生命的人，叫他们记住还欠着我一笔债呢。至于你，太太请你发发慈悲，不要在我背后拆台，对于那些我正在讨好的人不要取消她们赎取抵押品的权利，不要卖烂木头给她们，或者在别的方面欺侮她们。还有，无论如何不要再让布洛克州长进我家的家门了。你听见没有？你一直交往的那一帮文雅的盗贼，也不能再来了。你要是不听我的话仍邀他们，那就只好让你的宾客在这里找不到主人，使你陷入万分尴尬的境地了。如果他们进了这个门，我就要跑到贝尔.沃特琳的酒吧间去，告诉那里的每一个人，他们看到我不愿意跟好帮人在一起，是会十分愉快的。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett, who had been smarting under his words, laughed shortly.
<p>“So the river-boat gambler and the speculator is going to be respectable! Well, your first move toward respectability had better be the sale of Belle Watling’s house.”</p>That was a shot in the dark. She had never been absolutely certain that Rhett owned the house. He laughed suddenly, as though he read her mind.
<p>“Thanks for the suggestion.”</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉一直在忍受着听他的话，这时才挖苦地笑了。<p>“这么一来。那个驾河船的赌棍和投机家就要成为绅士了！我看，你要改邪归正的话，最好还是首先把贝尔.沃特琳的房子卖掉吧。”</p>这支箭是瞎放的。因为她一直不敢绝对肯定那所房子就是瑞德的。他突然大笑起来，仿佛猜着了思嘉的心思了。<p>“多谢你的建议了。”</p></div></div>

  <div class="left">Had he tried, Rhett could not have chosen a more difficult time to beat his way back to respectability. Never before or after did the names Republican and Scalawag carry such odium, for now the corruption of the Carpet bag regime was at its height. And, since the surrender, Rhett’s name had been inextricably linked with Yankees, Republicans and Scalawags.
<p>Atlanta people had thought, with helpless fury, in 1866, that nothing could be worse than the harsh military rule they had then, but now, under Bullock, they were learning the worst. Thanks to the negro vote, the Republicans and their allies were firmly entrenched and they were riding rough-shod over the powerless but still protesting minority.</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">要是瑞德事先已经尝试过的话，他就不会选择一个像现在这样困难的时来实行改邪归正了。不早不晚，恰好目前共和党人和参加共和党的南部白人名声最坏，因为提包党政权已经腐败到了极点。而且，自从投降以来，瑞德的名字已经跟北方佬、共和党人和参加共和党的南方白人紧密相连在一起了。<p>在一八六六年，亚特兰大曾经以无可奈何的愤怒心情感到世界上没有什么东西比他们当时的军事管制更坏的了，可是现在在布洛克的统治下才算明白这才是最坏的呢。共和党人和他们的同盟者依靠黑人的投票牢牢地确立了他们的统治，如今正在恣意蹂躏那个手中无权但仍在反抗的少数党。</p></div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Word had been spread among the negroes that there were only two political parties mentioned in the Bible, the Publicans and the Sinners. No negro wanted to join a party made up entirely of sinners, so they hastened to join the Republicans. Their new masters voted them over and over again, electing poor whites and Scalawags to high places, electing even some negroes. These negroes sat in the legislature where they spent most of their time eating goobers and easing their unaccustomed feet into and out of new shoes. Few of them could read or write. They were fresh from cotton patch and canebrake, but it was within their power to vote taxes and bonds as well as enormous expense accounts to themselves and their Republican friends. And they voted them. The state staggered under taxes which were paid in fury, for the taxpayers knew that much of the money voted for public purposes was finding its way into private pockets.</div>
  <div class="right">黑人中间广泛流传着一种言论，说《圣经》中只提到过两种人，即税吏和罪人。没有哪个黑人要加入一个完全由罪犯组成的政党，因此他们便争先恐后地参加了共和党。他们的新主子屡次投票支持他们，选举穷白人和参加共和党的南部白人担任高级职务，有时甚至选举某些黑人。这些黑人坐在州议会，大部分时间是在吃花生和把穿不惯的新鞋子不停地穿了又脱，脱了又穿。他们当中没有几个是会读书写字的。他们刚从锦花田和竹丛中出来。可是手中却掌握着投票表决有关税收、公债和对他们自己及其共和党朋友们巨额支出的账单的权力。他们当然投票表决予以通过。这个州在税收问题上有步履维艰的感觉，因为纳税人发现那些作为公共事业费表决通过的钱有不少落进了私人腰包，他们是怀着满腔愤怒在交税的。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Completely surrounding the state capital was a host of promoters, speculators, seekers after contracts and others hoping to profit from the orgy of spending, and many were growing shamelessly rich. They had no difficulty at all in obtaining the state’s money for building railroads that were never built, for buying cars and engines that were never bought, for erecting public buildings that never existed except in the minds of their promoters.
<p>Bonds were issued running into the millions. Most of them were illegal and fraudulent but they were issued just the same. The state treasurer, a Republican but an honest man, protested against the illegal issues and refused to sign them, but he and others who sought to check the abuses could do nothing against the tide that was running.</p>The state-owned railroad had once been an asset to the state but now it was a liability and its debts had piled up to the million mark. It was no longer a railroad. It was an enormous bottomless trough in which the hogs could swill and wallow. Many of its officials were appointed for political reasons, regardless of their knowledge of the operation of railroads, there were three times as many people employed as were necessary, Republicans rode free on passes, carloads of negroes rode free on their happy jaunts about the state to vote and revote in the same elections.
</div>
  <div class="right">州议会所在地被一大群企业推销人、投机家，承包竞争者以及其他渴望在这场消费大赛中捞一把的人水泄不通地包围了，其中有许多正在无耻地成为富翁。他们可以毫不费力地拿到州里为修筑铁路拨发的经费，可是铁路却永远修不起来；可以拿到买机车和火车车厢的钱，但结果什么没有买；也可以支取盖公共建筑的款子，可是这些建筑除了在于它们的发起人心中，是永远也不会出现的。<p>债券成百万发行，其中大部分是非法的，骗人的，但照发不误。州政府的财务局长是个共和党人，但为人诚实，他反对这种非法债券，拒不签字，可是他和另外一些想阻止这种渎职行为的人，在那股泛滥的潮流面前也毫无办法。</p>州营铁路本来是州财产的一部分来源，可现在变成了一种沉重的负担，它的债务已高达上百万的数额。它已经不再是铁路了。它成了一个巨大的无底食糟，猎猡们可以在里面肆意大喝大嚼，甚至打滚糟踏。许多负责人是凭政治关系委任的，根本不考虑他们是否有经营铁路的知识，职工人数是所需名额的三倍，共和党凭通行证免费乘车，大批大批的黑人也高兴地免费到处游览，并在同一次选举中一再投票。</div></div>

  <div class="left">The mismanagement of the state road especially infuriated the taxpayers for, out of the earnings of the road, was to come the money for free schools. But there were no earnings, there were only debts, and so there were no free schools and there was a generation of children growing up in ignorance who would spread the seeds of illiteracy down the years.</div>
  <div class="right">州营公路的经营不善尤其使纳税人愤怒，因为免费学校的经费是要从公路赢利中拨给的。可是现在不但没有赢利，反而欠债，结果也就没有免费的学校了。由于大部分人没钱送孩子上学，因此出现了从小在无知中成长起来的一代人，他们将在以后若干年中散播文盲的种子。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">But far and above their anger at the waste and mismanagement and graft was the resentment of the people at the bad light in which the governor represented them in the North. When Georgia howled against corruption, the governor hastily went North, appeared before Congress and told of white outrages against negroes, of Georgia’s preparation for another rebellion and the need for a stern military rule in the state. No Georgian wanted trouble with the negroes and they tried to avoid trouble. No one wanted another war, no one wanted or needed bayonet rule. All Georgia wanted was to be let alone so the state could recuperate. But with the operation of what came to be known as the governor’s “slander mill,” the North saw only a rebellious state that needed a heavy hand, and a heavy hand was laid upon it.</div>
  <div class="right">但是跟浪费、管理不善和贪污比起来，人们更加深恶痛绝的是州长在北方描述这些问题时所采取的卑劣手段。当佐治亚人民奋起反抗腐败时，州长便急急忙忙跑到北方去，在国会控诉白人凌辱黑人，控诉佐治亚州准备搞另一次叛乱，并提议在那里进行严厉的军事管制。其实佐治亚人没有哪个想同黑人闹纠纷，而只想避免这些纠纷。没有哪个想打第二次内战，也没有哪个要求和需要过刺刀下的管制生活。佐治亚唯一的要求的是不受干扰，让它自己去休养生息。但是，在被州人称之为"诽谤制造厂"的摆弄下，北方政府所看到的佐治亚是一个叛乱并需要严厉管制的州，而且确实加强了对它的管制。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">It was a glorious spree for the gang which had Georgia by the throat. There was an orgy of grabbing and over all there was a cold cynicism about open theft in high places that was chilling to contemplate. Protests and efforts to resist accomplished nothing, for the state government was being upheld and supported by the power of the United States Army.
<p>Atlanta cursed the name of Bullock and his Scalawags and Republicans and they cursed the name of anyone connected with them. And Rhett was connected with them. He had been in with them, so everyone said, in all their schemes. But now, he turned against the stream in which he had drifted so short a while before, and began swimming arduously back against the current.</p>He went about his campaign slowly, subtly, not arousing the suspicions of Atlanta by the spectacle of a leopard trying to change his spots overnight. He avoided his dubious cronies and was seen no more in the company of Yankee officers, Scalawags and Republicans. He attended Democratic rallies and he ostentatiously voted the Democratic ticket. He gave up high-stake card games and stayed comparatively sober. If he went to Belle Watling’s house at all, he went by night and by stealth as did more respectable townsmen, instead of leaving his horse hitched in front of her door in the afternoons as an advertisement of his presence within.
</div>
  <div class="right">对于那帮骑着佐治亚脖子的人来说，这是一件值得庆祝的大喜事。于是产生了一股巧取豪夺风气，高级官员也公开偷窃，而许多人对此采取冷漠的犬儒主义态度，这是令人想起来都不寒而栗的。实际上无论你抗议也罢，抵制也罢，都毫无用处，因为州政府是受合众国军事当局的鼓励和支持的呵。
<p>亚特兰大人诅咒布洛克以及那帮拥护他的南方人和共和党人，他们也憎恨那些同他们勾搭在一起的家伙。瑞德就是同他们有联系的。人人都认为他跟他们关系很好，对他们所有的阴谋诡计都熟知。可是如今，他转过头来在抵制那股他不久以前还混在里面的潮流了。并且开始在奋力拚博，逆流而上。</p>
他慢慢地巧妙地进行他的活动，不让亚特兰大发现他一夜之间判若两人而发生怀疑。他避开那些可疑的亲密伙伴，也不再同北方佬官员和拥护他们的南方白人以及共和党人在一起公开亮相了。他出席民主党的集会，并且故意夸张地投民主党人的票。他戒掉的高赌注的牌戏，喝酒也比较有节制了。哪怕他有时还到贝尔.沃琳那里去，也是在晚上偷偷去的，像本市一些较为体面的男人那样，而决不在下午去，把马拴在她的门前，让人家一看就知道他在里面。

  <div class="left">And the congregation of the Episcopal Church almost fell out of their pews when he tiptoed in, late for services, with Wade’s hand held in his. The congregation was as much stunned by Wade’s appearance as by Rhett’s, for the little boy was supposed to be a Catholic. At least, Scarlett was one. Or she was supposed to be one. But she had not put foot in the church in years, for religion had gone from her as many of Ellen’s other teachings had gone. Everyone thought she had neglected her boy’s religious education and thought more of Rhett for trying to rectify the matter, even if he did take the boy to the Episcopal Church instead of the Catholic.</div>
  <div class="right">他带着韦德上圣公会教堂做礼拜，但去得比较晚，当他踮着脚尖轻轻走进去时，几乎全场的人都吃惊得站起来了。他们不仅对瑞德而且对韦德的出现也大为吃惊，因为大家都以为这个孩子是天主教徒呢。至少思嘉是天主教徒，或者大家以为她是。但是她多年没进教堂的门了，因为宗教也像爱伦的其他许多教导一样，早已被她抛弃得干干净净。大家都认为她疏忽了对孩子的宗教教育，因此对于瑞德，由于他竟然在设法纠正这一点，便有些好感了，尽管他没有把孩子带到天主教堂去，而是带到圣公会教堂来了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Rhett could be grave of manner and charming when he chose to restrain his tongue and keep his black eyes from dancing maliciously. It had been years since he had chosen to do this but he did it now, putting on gravity and charm, even as he put on waistcoats of more sober hues. It was not difficult to gain a foothold of friendliness with the men who owed their necks to him. They would have showed their appreciation long ago, had Rhett not acted as if their appreciation were a matter of small moment. Now, Hugh Elsing, René, the Simmons boys, Andy Bonnell and the others found him pleasant, diffident about putting himself forward and embarrassed when they spoke of the obligation they owed him.</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德只要注意管住他的舌头，并且不让他那双黑眼睛恶意地嘲弄别人，他是可以显得又严肃又可爱的。他已经多年没这样做。可是现在却注意起来，装出严肃可爱的模样，甚至连背心也是穿颜色更加扑素的了。对于那些被他挽救了生命的人来说，瑞德要同他们建立友好关系是没有什么困难的。只要瑞德的态度不让他们觉得他们感激无足轻重的话，他们早就向他表示谢意了。现在休.埃尔辛、雷内、西蒙兄弟、安迪.邦内尔和其他很多人都感到他可亲而又谦虚，不愿意突出自己，而且他们谈到他的恩惠时还显得很难为情呢。</div></div>

  <div class="left">“It was nothing,” he would protest. “In my place you’d have all done the same thing.”
<p>He subscribed handsomely to the fund for the repairs of the Episcopal Church and he gave a large, but not vulgarly large, contribution to the Association for the Beautification of the Graves of Our Glorious Dead. He sought out Mrs. Elsing to make this donation and embarrassedly begged that she keep his gift a secret, knowing very well that this would spur her to spreading the news. Mrs. Elsing hated to take his money—“speculator money”—but the Association needed money badly.</p>“I don’t see why you of all people should be subscribing,” she said acidly.
</div>
  <div class="right">“那不算什么，"他会表示不同的意见。"要是你们处在我的位置上，你们也会那样做的。"<p>他向圣公会教堂修复基金会愤慨捐款，并且给了"阵亡将士公墓装修协会"一笔巨大而又大得适当的捐款。他请出埃尔辛太太来经办这一捐赠，交难为情地请求她为这件事保密，尽管他明明知道这只会使促她到处传播个消息。埃尔辛太太不愿意接受这笔钱--"投机商的钱"--要是协会缺钱缺得厉害着呢！</p>“我倒有些不懂，怎么你也来捐钱哪，"她刻薄地说。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">When Rhett told her with the proper sober mien that he was moved to contribute by the memories of former comrades in arms, braver than he but less fortunate, who now lay in unmarked graves, Mrs. Elsing’s aristocratic jaw dropped. Dolly Merriwether had told her Scarlett had said Captain Butler was in the army but, of course, she hadn’t believed it. Nobody had believed it.
<p>“You in the army? What was your company—your regiment?”</p>Rhett gave them.
</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德以适当冷静的态度告诉她。他是回想起以前在军队里的人，那些比他更勇敢却不如他幸运的人，他们现在还躺在默默无闻的坟墓里，使他很受感动，因此才捐赠的。埃尔辛太太听得把胖胖的下颚张了。梅里韦瑟太太曾告诉过她，思嘉说的巴特勒船长参加过军队，可是她当然不相信。事实上有谁会相信呢？<p>“你参加过军队吗？你是哪个边--哪个团的！”</p>瑞德回答了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">"Oh, the artillery! Everyone I knew was either in the cavalry or the infantry. Then, that explains—” She broke off, disconcerted, expecting to see his eyes snap with that ice. But he only looked down and toyed with his watch chain.
<p>“I would have liked the infantry,” he said, passing completely over her insinuation, “but when they found that I was a West Pointer—though I did not graduate, Mrs. Elsing, due to a boyish prank—they put me in the artillery, the regular artillery, not the militia. They needed men with specialized knowledge in that last campaign. You know how heavy the losses had been, so many artillerymen killed. It was pretty lonely in the artillery. I didn’t see a soul I knew. I don’t believe I saw a single man from Atlanta during my whole service.”</p>“Well!” said Mrs. Elsing, confused. If he had been in the army then she was wrong. She had made many sharp remarks about his cowardice and the memory of them made her feel guilty. “Well! And why haven’t you ever told anybody about your service? You act as though you were ashamed of it.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“唔，炮兵队！我认识的人要么在骑兵队，要么是步兵。那么，这说明--"她突然停住了，不知怎么说好，只得准备看他双眼睛恶意地眨巴了，但是他垂下眼皮，玩弄那条表链。<p>“我本来想参加步兵，"他说，毫不理会埃尔辛太太那讨好的语气，"可是他们发现我是西点军校出身的--尽管我没有毕业，埃尔辛太太，由于犯了孩子气的毛病，--他们把我编在炮兵队，正规的炮兵队，不是民兵里的。在那最后的战役中他们很需要有专门知识的人呢。你知道损失多重，死了多少炮兵队的人呀！在炮兵队是相当寂寞的。我在那里一个人也不认识。我想在我整个的服役期间我没看见过一个亚特兰大人。"</p>“嗯！"埃尔辛太太心里有点混乱了。假如他真的参加过军队，那么她就错了。她曾经说过他很多坏话，说他是胆小鬼，现在想起来感到内疚，"嗯！那你怎么从不对别人谈你这服役的事呢？你好像感到进了军队很可耻似的。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Rhett looked her squarely in the eyes, his face blank.
<p>“Mrs. Elsing,” he said earnestly, “believe me when I say that I am prouder of my services to the Confederacy than of anything I have ever done or will do. I feel—I feel—”</p>
“Well, why did you keep it hidden?”
<p>“I was ashamed to speak of it, in the light of—of some of my former actions.”</p>
Mrs. Elsing reported the contribution and the conversation in detail to Mrs. Merriwether.
</div>
  <div class="right">瑞德勇敢地直视着她的眼睛，他脸上显得毫无表情。<p>“埃尔辛太太，"他诚恳地说，"请你相信，我对自己为南部联盟服务而感到的骄傲，胜过对于我以前所做和将来要做的一切呢。我感到--我感到--"</p>“好吧，可是你以前为什么要隐瞒呀？"<p>“我难为情，想到--想到我过去的一些行为。”</p>埃尔辛太太把他的捐款和这次谈话详详细细地对梅里韦瑟太太说了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“And, Dolly, I give you my word that when he said that about being ashamed, tears came into his eyes! Yes, tears! I nearly cried myself.”
<p>“Stuff and nonsense!” cried Mrs. Merriwether in disbelief. “I don’t believe tears came into his eyes any more than I believe he was in the army. And I can find out mighty quick. If he was in that artillery outfit, I can get at the truth, for Colonel Carleton who commanded it married the daughter of one of my grandfather’s sisters and I’ll write him.”</p>She wrote Colonel Carlton and to her consternation received a reply praising Rhett’s services in no uncertain terms. A born artilleryman, a brave soldier and an uncomplaining gentleman, a modest man who wouldn’t even take a commission when it was offered him.
</div>
  <div class="right">“而且，多丽，我向你保证，他说到自己难为情时，眼泪都快流出来了呢！真的，眼泪！那时我自己差一点哭了！"<p>"胡说八道！"梅里瑟太太根本不相信。"我既不相信他参加过军队，也不相信他会流眼泪。而且我很快就能查出来。如果他参加过炮兵队，我能够了解到实际情况。因为当时指挥那个部队的卡尔顿上校是我姑婆的女婿，我可以写信去问他。"</p>她给卡尔顿上校去了信，结果叫她大为难堪的是，回信中竟明确无误地称赞瑞德在那里服役的表现，说他是一个天生的炮兵，一个勇敢的军人，一位从不叫苦的上等人，他十分谦逊，连提供给他职位时也拒不接受。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well!” said Mrs. Merriwether showing the letter to Mrs. Elsing. “You can knock me down with a feather! Maybe we did misjudge the scamp about not being a soldier. Maybe we should have believed what Scarlett and Melanie said about him enlisting the day the town fell. But, just the same, he’s a Scalawag and a rascal and I don’t like him!”
<p>“Somehow,” said Mrs. Elsing uncertainly, “somehow, I don’t think he’s so bad. A man who fought for the Confederacy can’t be all bad. It’s Scarlett who is the bad one. Do you know, Dolly, I really believe that he—well, he’s ashamed of Scarlett but is too much of a gentleman to let on.”</p>“Ashamed! Pooh! They’re both cut out of the same piece of cloth. Where did you ever get such a silly notion?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“好啊！"梅里韦瑟太太说，一面把信交给埃尔辛太太看。“你就这样不费吹灰之力把我击倒了！也许我们不相信他当过兵是把这个流氓估计错了。也许我们应当相信思嘉和媚兰说的，他在这个城市陷落那天入伍了。不过，反正一样，他是个支持共和党的无赖，我就是不喜欢他！"<p>“不知为什么，“埃尔辛太太犹豫不决地说，”不知为什么，我觉得他不一定那么坏。一个为南部联盟战斗过的人是不会坏到哪里去的。思嘉才坏呢。你知道吗，多丽，我真的相信，他--嗯，他为思嘉感到羞愧，不过作为一个上等人不好意思说出口罢了。”</p>“羞愧！呸！他们两个完全是同样的货色。你怎么会有这种可笑的想法呢？”</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“It isn’t silly,” said Mrs. Elsing indignantly. “Yesterday, in the pouring rain, he had those three children, even the baby, mind you, out in his carriage riding them up and down Peachtree Street and he gave me a lift home. And when I said: ‘Captain Butler, have you lost your mind keeping these children out in the damp? Why don’t you take them home?’ And he didn’t say a word but just looked embarrassed. But Mammy spoke up and said: ‘De house full of w’ite trash an’ it healthier fer de chillun in de rain dan at home!’ ”
<p>“What did he say?”</p>“What could he say? He just scowled at Mammy and passed it over. You know Scarlett was giving a big whist party yesterday afternoon with all those common ordinary women there. I guess he didn’t want them kissing his baby.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“这并不可笑嘛，"埃尔辛太太生气地说。"昨天，在倾盆大雨中，他带着那三个孩子，请注意，连那个婴儿也在内，坐着他那辆马车出门，在桃树街上跑来跑去，还让我搭他的车回家了呢。那时我说：'巴特勒船长，你在大雨天带着这三个孩子出门，不是发疯了吗？你为什么不赶紧带他们回家呀？'他一言不发，只是显得不好意思似的。不过嬷嬷倒说话了：'家里有挤满了下流白人。孩子们在雨里比在家里能呼吸更好的空气呢！"<p>“他怎么说？"</p>“他还能怎么说呀？他只是对嬷嬷皱了皱眉头，就不再理会了。你知道思嘉昨天下午举办了一个桥牌会，所有那些下贱的女人全去了。我猜他是不让她们吻他的孩子呢！"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well!” said Mrs. Merriwether, wavering but still obstinate. But the next week she, too, capitulated.
<p>Rhett now had a desk in the bank. What he did at this desk the bewildered officials of the bank did not know, but he owned too large a block of the stock for them to protest his presence there. After a while they forgot that they had objected to him for he was quiet and well mannered and actually knew something about banking and investments. At any rate he sat at his desk all day, giving every appearance of industry, for he wished to be on equal terms with his respectable fellow townsmen who worked and worked hard.</p>Mrs. Merriwether, wishing to expand her growing bakery, had tried to borrow two thousand dollars from the bank with her house as security. She had been refused because there were already two mortgages on the house. The stout old lady was storming out of the bank when Rhett stopped her, learned the trouble and said, worriedly: “But there must be some mistake, Mrs. Merriwether. Some dreadful mistake. You of all people shouldn’t have to bother about collateral. Why, I’d lend you money just on your word! Any lady who could build up the business you’ve built up is the best risk in the world. The bank wants to lend money to people like you. Now, do sit down right here in my chair and I will attend to it for you.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“好吧！"梅里韦瑟太太有点动摇，可仍然坚持不信。但是到了下一个星期，她就终于投降了。<p>瑞德如今在银行里有一张办公桌了。他究竟在那里干什么，银行里那些莫名其妙的官员也弄清楚，不过他持有那么多的股票，他们对此也不敢说什么话。过了一阵子，他们便忘记自己为曾经他对产了生反感了，因为他又文明又和气，还真正懂得一些办银行和投资的事。不管怎样，他整天坐在办公桌前，装出非常认真的模样，因为他希望同那些有工作而且勤奋工作的有声望的市民建立彼此平等的关系。</p>梅里韦瑟太太一心想扩充她的面包店，曾设法以她房子作担保向银行借贷两千美元，可是银行拒绝贷款，因为她的房子已经作了两处抵押了。这位壮实的老太太婆呼呼地走出银行，这时瑞德把她拦住了，向她问明了情况，然后带着歉意地说：“我一定是发生了误会，梅里韦瑟太太。发生了某种严重的误会。怎么连你也得找担保了。要不，我借给你钱，只要你一句话就行！，任何一位太太，只要她开办了像你开办起来的那种事业，就是世界上最好的担保了。银行就是要借钱给你这样的人嘛。好，请就在我这椅子上坐坐，我立即给你去办。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">When he came back he was smiling blandly, saying that there had been a mistake, just as he had thought. The two thousand dollars was right there waiting for her whenever she cared to draw against it. Now, about her house—would she just sign right here?
<p>Mrs. Merriwether, torn with indignation and insult, furious that she had to take this favor from a man she disliked and distrusted, was hardly gracious in her thanks.</p>But he failed to notice it As he escorted her to the door, he said: “Mrs. Merriwether, I have always had a great regard for your knowledge and I wonder if you could tell me something?”
</div>
  <div class="right">“他回来时和平地微笑着，说事情就像他所想的那样，是发生了误会。那两千美元已经存在那里，任凭她什么时候支取都行，那么，关于她那所房子--是否就请她现在签个字好吧？<p>梅里韦瑟太太心里又气又羞，想不到竟然要从一个她讨厌和不信任的人手中接受恩惠呀！因此她尽管口头表示谢意，但实际是没有什么好感的。</p>但是瑞德并没有在意这一点。他把她送到门口，然后说：“梅里韦瑟太太，我一向十分钦佩你的知识丰富，但不知你能不能传授我一点？"</div></div>

  <div class="left">The plumes on her bonnet barely moved as she nodded.
<p>“What did you do when your Maybelle was little and she sucked her thumb?”</p>“What?”
<p>“My Bonnie sucks her thumb. I can’t make her stop it.”</p>“You should make her stop it,” said Mrs. Merriwether vigorously. “It will ruin the shape of her mouth.”
</div>
  <div class="right">她点点头，那帽子的羽毛在一个劲儿颤动。<p>“你家梅贝尔小时候吮她的大拇指时，你暗怎么对付的呢？"</p>“什么？"<p>“我家的邦妮吮大拇指，我怎么也制止不住她。"</p>“你应当制止她，"梅里韦瑟太太坚决地说。"那会弄坏她的嘴巴的模样的。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“I know! I know! And she has a beautiful mouth. But I don’t know what to do.”
<p>“Well, Scarlett ought to know,” said Mrs. Merriwether shortly. “She’s had two other children.”</p>Rhett looked down at his shoes and sighed.
<p>“I’ve tried putting soap under her finger nails,” he said, passing over her remark about Scarlett.</p>“Soap! Bah! Soap is no good at all. I put quinine on Maybelle’s thumb and let me tell you, Captain Butler, she stopped sucking that thumb mighty quick.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“我知道！我知道！她的嘴长得很美。可是我并不知道怎么办呀。"<p>“那，思嘉总该知道嘛，"梅里韦瑟太太直率地说。"她还养了两个孩子呢。"</p>瑞德低下头来看看自己的鞋，叹了一口气。<p>“已经试过，在她的指甲底下放点肥皂，"他说，没有理会她对思嘉的指责。</p>“肥皂！哼！肥皂有什么用。我从前给梅贝尔在大拇指上放奎宁，我说，巴特勒船长，她很快就不再吮大拇指了。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Quinine! I would never have thought of it! I can’t thank you enough, Mrs. Merriwether. It was worrying me.”
<p>He gave her a smile, so pleasant, so grateful that Mrs. Merriwether stood uncertainly for a moment. But as she told him good-by she was smiling too. She hated to admit to Mrs. Elsing that she had misjudged the man but she was an honest person and she said there had to be something good about a man who loved his child. What a pity Scarlett took no interest in so pretty a creature as Bonnie! There was something pathetic about a man trying to raise a little girl all by himself! Rhett knew very well the pathos of the spectacle, and if it blackened Scarlett’s reputation he did not care.</p>From the time the child could walk he took her about with him constantly, in the carriage or in front of his saddle. When he came home from the bank in the afternoon, he took her walking down Peachtree Street, holding her hand, slowing his long strides to her toddling steps, patiently answering her thousand questions. People were always in their front yards or on their porches at sunset and, as Bonnie was such a friendly, pretty child, with her tangle of black curls and her bright blue eyes, few could resist talking to her. Rhett never presumed on these conversations but stood by, exuding fatherly pride and gratification at the notice taken of his daughter.
</div>
  <div class="right">“奎宁！我可从没想过呢？太感谢了，梅里韦瑟太太。这件事真叫我伤脑筋呀。"<p>他对她微微一笑，显得那么高兴，那么感激，这使得梅里韦瑟太太一时心里有点糊涂了。不过她向他向告别时也笑了一笑。她不愿意向埃尔辛太太承认自己看错了这个人，但她还是老实地表示一个人只要是爱他的孩子便不会没有优点的。思嘉居然对邦妮这样一个可爱的小家伙不关心，这多叫人伤心啊！一个男人得设法亲自抚育一个女孩，这也够可怜的了！瑞德很清楚地知道这情景多么感人，至于是否会损坏思嘉的名声，他可不管了。</p>自从那孩子学会了走路以后，瑞德便常常将地带在身边四处走动，有时坐马车，有时骑马，把她放在马鞍前头。每天下午他从银行回到家里，便带她出去到桃树街散步，牵着她的手，自己放慢脚步让她蹒跚地行走，一路上耐心地回答她提出的无数问题。黄昏时候，人们经常站自己的前院或走廊上，看到邦妮这样一个满头鬈发和眼睛蓝得发亮的小姑娘，都感到她很可爱，总是忍不住要跟她说说话。瑞德从来不打搅这种谈话，只悄悄地站在一旁，流露出作父亲的骄傲和对人们这样夸奖他女儿的喜悦之情。</div></div>

  <div class="left">Atlanta had a long memory and was suspicious and slow to change. Times were hard and feeling was bitter against anyone who had had anything to do with Bullock and his crowd. But Bonnie had the combined charm of Scarlett and Rhett at their best and she was the small opening wedge Rhett drove into the wall of Atlanta’s coldness.</div>
  <div class="right">亚特兰大人的记性特好，他们对事物颇多猜疑，很难改变自己的习惯和看法。现在时世艰难，人们对任何一个跟布洛克州长及其一伙有关系的人都抱着强烈的敌意。可是邦妮身上综合了思嘉和瑞德两个各自最可爱的地方，因此瑞德就把她作为一个个的楔子，用来打进亚特兰大人冷酷的墙壁中去了。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Bonnie grew rapidly and every day it became more evident that Gerald O’Hara had been her grandfather. She had short sturdy legs and wide eyes of Irish blue and a small square jaw that went with a determination to have her own way. She had Gerald’s sudden temper to which she gave vent in screaming tantrums that were forgotten as soon as her wishes were gratified. And as long as her father was near her, they were always gratified hastily. He spoiled her despite all the efforts of Mammy and Scarlett, for in all things she pleased him, except one. And that was her fear of the dark.</div>
  <div class="right">邦妮一天天迅速成长，她越发显出作为杰拉尔德.奥哈拉的外孙女的本色来了。她的两条腿又粗又短，一双大眼睛呈现出爱尔兰人特有的天蓝色，而那个小小的正方形下颚更表明她是坚决要按自己的意志行事的。她像杰拉尔德那样很容易发脾气，发作起来便突然大叫大喊，可是一旦她的愿望得到满足就压根儿忘了。只要她父亲在身边，她的愿望总是很快就得到满足的。不管思嘉和嬷嬷怎样反对，他仍然姑息迁就她，因为她处处讨他喜欢，只有一件事例外，那就是她害怕黑暗。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Until she was two years old she went to sleep readily in the nursery she shared with Wade and Ella. Then, for no apparent reason, she began to sob whenever Mammy waddled out of the room, carrying the lamp. From this she progressed to wakening in the late night hours, screaming with terror, frightening the other two children and alarming the house. Once Dr. Meade had to be called and Rhett was short with him when he diagnosed only bad dreams. All anyone could get from her was one word, “Dark.”</div>
  <div class="right">她同韦德和爱拉一起睡在育儿室里，两周岁之前往往很快就能睡着。后来，也不知什么原故，只要嬷嬷一拿着灯走出房间她就哭了。后来又发展到经常在深夜醒来，恐地尖声叫喊，这不但把另外两个孩子惊醒，而且闹得全家都惶惶不安起来。有一次不得不把米德大夫请来，他诊断说是做恶梦，瑞德听了还非常不满。但无论谁问她，得到的回答只有一个词儿：“黑暗。"</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett was inclined to be irritated with the child and favored a spanking. She would not humor her by leaving a lamp burning in the nursery, for then Wade and Ella would be unable to sleep. Rhett, worried but gentle, attempting to extract further information from his daughter, said coldly that if any spanking were done, he would do it personally and to Scarlett.</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉给这孩子闹得不耐烦了，便主张打她一顿。她不想迁就她，在育儿室通宵点灯，那会使得韦德和爱拉不能睡觉。瑞德也很苦恼，但依然非常耐心，希望从女儿嘴里掏出更多的解释来；他说如果要打一顿的话，那就由他自己动手，而且是打思嘉。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The upshot of the situation was that Bonnie was removed from the nursery to the room Rhett now occupied alone. Her small bed was placed beside his large one and a shaded lamp burned on the table all night long. The town buzzed when this story got about. Somehow, there was something indelicate about a girl child sleeping in her father’s room, even though the girl was only two years old. Scarlett suffered from this gossip in two ways. First, it proved indubitably that she and her husband occupied separate rooms, in itself a shocking enough state of affairs. Second, everyone thought that if the child was afraid to sleep alone, her place was with her mother. And Scarlett did not feel equal to explaining that she could not sleep in a lighted room nor would Rhett permit the child to sleep with her.</div>
  <div class="right">这个问题的最终解决办法是将邦妮从育儿室搬到瑞德现在一个人住的那间房里。她那张小床摆在瑞德大床的旁边，桌上有一盏带罩的灯，常常通宵点着，此事一传出去，全城都私下里议论纷纷。不管怎么样，一个女孩子睡在父亲房里，总是有点不怎么合适嘛，哪怕这姑娘还只有两岁呢。这种闲言使思嘉在两个方面受到了压力。第一，它毋庸置疑地证实她跟丈夫是分房睡的，这本身就是骇人听闻的了。第二，大家都觉得如果孩子不敢一个人单独睡，那就得跟她母亲在一起。而思嘉感到自己难以说明，她既不能点着灯睡觉，瑞德又不让孩子跟她在一起睡。</div></div>
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“You’d never wake up unless she screamed and then you’d probably slap her,” he said shortly.
<p>Scarlett was annoyed at the weight he attached to Bonnie’s night terrors but she thought she could eventually remedy the state of affairs and transfer the child back to the nursery. All children were afraid of the dark and the only cure was firmness. Rhett was just being perverse in the matter, making her appear a poor mother, just to pay her back for banishing him from her room.</p></div>
  <div class="right">“你是只要她不大叫大嚷就从不醒来的，而且醒来后可能还打她呢，"瑞德不满地说。<p>思嘉对于瑞德那么关心邦妮的夜哭症感到非常恼火，但是她认为她可以纠正这一局面，让邦妮再搬回育儿室去。所有的孩子都是害怕黑暗的，惟一的办法就是决不迁就。瑞德正是在这一点上处理错了，结果反而让她这个当妈的显得很狼狈，这好像是由于她把他关在门外的而她的报复呢。</p></div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He had never put foot in her room or even rattled the door knob since the night she told him she did not want any more children. Thereafter and until he began staying at home on account of Bonnie’s fears, he had been absent from the supper table more often than he had been present. Sometimes he had stayed out all night and Scarlett, lying awake behind her locked door, hearing the clock count off the early morning hours, wondered where he was. She remembered: “There are other beds, my dear!” Though the thought made her writhe, there was nothing she could do about it. There was nothing she could say that would not precipitate a scene in which he would be sure to remark upon her locked door and the probable connection Ashley had with it. Yes, his foolishness about Bonnie sleeping in a lighted room—in his lighted room—was just a mean way of paying her back.</div>
  <div class="right">自从那天晚上她告诉他她不要再生孩子以来，他一直没有迈过她的门槛，甚至连门把手也没扭过。从那以后，一直到他由于邦妮害怕而开始留在家里为止，他不在家吃晚饭比在家吃的次数还多。有时他整夜不归，使得思嘉锁着门躺在床上夜不能寐，听着滴答的钟摆一直响到天明，也不知道他到底到哪里去了。她记得他说：“亲爱的，我还有别的床好去睡呢！“尽管她一想起这句话就痛心，可是也毫无办法。她什么话也不能说，因为一说就会引起激烈的争吵，那时他准要指责她锁门的事，甚至还可能涉及到艾希礼。暗的，他让邦妮在房里--在他房里--点着灯睡觉这样的蠢事，不过是一种报复她的卑劣手段罢了。</div></div>
    
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">She did not realize the importance he attached to Bonnie’s foolishness nor the completeness of his devotion to the child until one dreadful night. The family never forgot that night.
<p>That day Rhett had met an ex-blockade runner and they had had much to say to each other. Where they had gone to talk and drink, Scarlett did not know but she suspected, of course, Belle Watling’s house. He did not come home in the afternoon to take Bonnie walking nor did he come home to supper. Bonnie, who had watched from the window impatiently all afternoon, anxious to display a mangled collection of beetles and roaches to her father, had finally been put to bed by Lou, amid wails and protests.</p>Either Lou had forgotten to light the lamp or it had burned out. No one ever knew exactly what happened but when Rhett finally came home, somewhat the worse for drink, the house was in an uproar and Bonnie’s screams reached him even in the stables. She had waked in darkness and called for him and he had not been there. All the nameless horrors that peopled her small imagination clutched her. All the soothing and bright lights brought by Scarlett and the servants could not quiet her and Rhett, coming up the stairs three at a jump, looked like a man who has seen Death.
</div>
  <div class="right">她不理解他对邦妮夜哭症给予的重视，以及他对于这个孩子的全心全意的钟爱，直到一个可怕的夜晚出现为止。<p>那个夜晚是全家永远不会忘记的。那天白天，瑞德遇见一个过去跑封锁线的同行，他们彼此有谈不完的话。他们究竟到哪里叙谈和喝酒去了，思嘉并不知道，不过当然她怀疑他们是在贝尔.沃琳特那里。下午他没有回来带邦妮去散步，也没回来吃晚饭。邦妮整个下午都在窗口焦急地盼望着，渴望在父亲面前展览一大堆被弄死的甲虫和蟑螂，可最后不得不连哭带骂地被卢儿抱上床去睡觉了。</p>不知是卢儿忘记点灯了呢，还是灯自己熄灭了，反正谁也弄不清是怎么回事，可是等到瑞德终于回来，尤其是喝了酒回来时，他还在马厩里便听见全家闹翻了天，邦妮的尖叫声显得特别刺耳。原来邦妮在黑暗中醒来了，她叫父亲，可是他不在，于是她想像中所有那些叫不出名来的妖魔鬼怪都一起来把她抓住了。不管思嘉怎样抚慰，不管仆人们端来多亮的灯光，都无法让她静下来，而瑞德三步并两步地奔上楼来时，也吓得像见了鬼似的。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">When he finally had her in his arms and from her sobbing gasps had recognized only one word, “Dark,” he turned on Scarlett and the negroes in fury.
<p>“Who put out the light? Who left her alone in the dark? Prissy, I’ll skin you for this, you—”</p>“Gawdlmighty, Mist’ Rhett! ‘Twarn’t me! ‘Twuz Lou!”
<p>“Fo’ Gawd, Mist’ Rhett, Ah—”</p>“Shut up. You know my orders. By God, I’ll—get out. Don’t come back. Scarlett, give her some money and see that she’s gone before I come down stairs. Now, everybody get out, everybody!”
</div>
  <div class="right">最后瑞德总算把她抱到了怀里，他问她怎么回事，她边喘，边抽泣着，从中只能听清楚“黑暗"这个词儿，于是他愤怒地回过头来向思嘉和几个黑人厉声质问。<p>“是谁把灯吹灭的？谁把她单独留在黑屋子里？百尔茜，我剥你的皮，你--"</p>“啊，上帝瑞德先生！那不是我呀！是卢儿呢！"<p>“天知道，瑞德先生，我--"</p>“住嘴！你明明知道我的命令。上帝作证，我要--给我滚！别再回来了。思嘉，给她点钱，打发她走，在你下楼之前就走。现在，你们都给我出去，都出去。</div></div>
    
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">The negroes fled, the luckless Lou wailing into her apron. But Scarlett remained. It was hard to see her favorite child quieting in Rhett’s arms when she had screamed so pitifully in her own. It was hard to see the small arms going around his neck and hear the choking voice relate what had frightened her, when she, Scarlett, had gotten nothing coherent out of her.
<p>“So it sat on your chest,” said Rhett softly. “Was it a big one?”</p>“Oh, yes! Dretfull big. And claws.”
</div>
  <div class="right">“几个黑人都溜了，那个倒霉的卢儿还一路用围裙捂着脸伤心地哭泣。但思嘉留在那里。看到自己心爱的孩子在瑞德怀里渐渐安静下来，而刚才她抱着时却哭得那么伤心，这滋味是很不好受的。同样，看到那两条小小的胳臂抱着他的脖子，听到那哽咽的声音在述说她是怎么受惊的，而思嘉刚才从她嘴里却什么也没掏出来，这叫她多么尴尬呀！<p>“这么说，它是坐在你胸口上了，"瑞德温柔地说。"它是个很大的家伙吗？”</p>“啊，是的！大极了。还有爪子呢。"</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Ah, claws, too. Well, now. I shall certainly sit up all night and shoot him if he comes back.” Rhett’s voice was interested and soothing and Bonnie’s sobs died away. Her voice became less choked as she went into detailed description of her monster guest in a language which only he could understand. Irritation stirred in Scarlett as Rhett discussed the matter as if it had been something real.
<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Rhett—”</p>But he made a sign for silence. When Bonnie was at last asleep, he laid her in her bed and pulled up the sheet.
<p>“I’m going to skin that nigger alive,” he said quietly. It’s your fault too. Why didn’t you come up here to see if the light was burning?”</p>“Don’t be a fool, Rhett,” she whispered. “She gets this way because you humor her. Lots of children are afraid of the dark but they get over it. Wade was afraid but I didn’t pamper him. If you’d just let her scream for a night or two—”
</div>
  <div class="right">“哎，还有爪子。现在好了。我一定整晚坐着，只要它回来就枪毙它。"瑞德的声音认真而亲切，邦妮听着听着就不抽泣了。她的声音也不再那么受压抑，现在开始用一种只有他懂得的语言在详细描述她的那个大怪物。瑞德跟她讨论，好像那是真的似的，这使思嘉又厌烦起来了。<p>“看在老天面上，瑞德--”</p>但是他摆摆手叫她别作声。后来邦妮终于睡着了，他把她放在床上，盖好被子。<p>“我要去活剥那个黑鬼的皮，"他低声说。"这也是你的过错。你干吗不上来看看是不是点了灯呢？"</p>“别傻了，瑞德，"她悄悄地说。"她养成了这个习惯，就是因为你迁就她。有多少孩子害怕黑暗，可是他们慢慢就习惯了。韦德本来也怕，但我没有迁就他。你只要让她哭一两个晚上--"</div></div>
    
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Let her scream!” For a moment Scarlett thought he would hit her. “Either you are a fool or the most inhuman woman I’ve ever seen.”
<p>“I don’t want her to grow up nervous and cowardly.”</p>“Cowardly? Hell’s afire! There isn’t a cowardly bone in her body! But you haven’t any imagination and, of course, you can’t appreciate the tortures of people who have one—especially a child. If something with claws and horns came and sat on your chest, you’d tell it to get the hell off you, wouldn’t you? Like hell you would. Kindly remember, Madam, that I’ve seen you wake up squalling like a scalded cat simply because you dreamed of running in a fog. And that’s not been so long ago either!”
</div>
  <div class="right">“让她哭！"霎那间思嘉以为他要动手打她了。"你要么是个笨蛋，要么是个我从没见过的最没人性的女人。”<p>“我可不要她长大以后变得又神经质又胆小"</p>“胆小？见鬼去吧！她身上连一点胆小的影子也没有。只不过你毫无想像力，因此才不能理解那些有想像力的人--尤其是一个孩子--的痛苦罢了。要是一个有爪子有角的东西来坐在你胸口上，你会叫它流开去，对罢？你会拼命大喊大叫呢！你好好回想一下，太太，我曾经听见你像只烫坏的猫似的狂叫着醒来，那仅仅因为你梦见在雾里奔跑而已。而且这种事不久以前还发生过呀！"</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">Scarlett was taken aback, for she never liked to think of that dream. Moreover, it embarrassed her to remember that Rhett had comforted her in much the same manner he comforted Bonnie. So she swung rapidly to a different attack.
<p>“You are just humoring her and—”</p>“And I intend to keep on humoring her. If I do, she’ll outgrow it and forget about it.”
<p>“Then,” said Scarlett acidly, “if you intend to play nursemaid, you might try coming home nights and sober too, for a change.”</p>“I shall come home early but drunk as a fiddler’s bitch if I please.”
</div>
  <div class="right">思嘉被堵回去了，因为她从来不喜欢去想起那个梦。而且叫她去回忆瑞德曾经以几乎像现现在安慰邦妮这样的态度安慰过她，也是很难堪的。所以她便迅速改换了划攻的方式。<p>“你这样做正好是迁就她，而且--”</p>“而且我打算继续迁就下去。只要我这样做，她就会逐渐克服它，把它忘了。"<p>“那么，"思嘉刻薄地说，"你要是打算当保姆，你就得想办法改变一下习惯，晚上早点回家，也不要再喝酒了。"</p>“我一定早早回来，不过我高兴时还会喝得烂醉的。"</div></div>
    
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He did come home early thereafter, arriving long before time for Bonnie to be put to bed. He sat beside her, holding her hand until sleep loosened her grasp. Only then did he tiptoe downstairs, leaving the lamp burning brightly and the door ajar so he might hear her should she awake and become frightened. Never again did he intend her to have a recurrence of fear of the dark. The whole household was acutely conscious of the burning light, Scarlett, Mammy, Prissy and Pork, frequently tiptoeing upstairs to make sure that it still burned.</div>
  <div class="right">从那以后他确实回来得早了，往往在邦妮上床睡觉以前好久就到了家里。他坐在她身旁，拉着她的手，直到她瞌睡得渐渐把手放松了为止。这时他才踮着脚尖悄悄下楼，让灯光照亮地点在那里，门也半开着，好叫她一旦醒来害怕时他听得见。从此他再见也不想让她在黑暗中受惊那样的事重新发生了。全家的人都常常当心那盏灯熄灭了，思嘉、嬷嬷、百里茜和波克时常摄手摄脚上楼看看，保证不出什么意外。</div></div>
  
  
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">He came home sober too, but that was none of Scarlett’s doing. For months he had been drinking heavily, though he was never actually drunk, and one evening the smell of whisky was especially strong upon his breath. He picked up Bonnie, swung her to his shoulder and asked her: “Have you a kiss for your sweetheart?”
<p>She wrinkled her small upturned nose and wriggled to get down from his arms.</p>“No,” she said frankly. “Nasty.”
<p>“I’m what?”</p>“Smell nasty. Uncle Ashley don’t smell nasty.”
</div>
  <div class="right">他每次回家都没有喝醉，不过这决不是思嘉的功劳。几个月来他一直在大量饮酒，尽管这从来没有真正醉过，有一天晚上他呼吸中的威士忌酒气还特别强烈，他把邦妮抱起来，把她一下扛在肩上，然后问她：“你要给你亲爱的爸爸一个吻吗？<p>“她耸起她那个翘翘的鼻子，扭摆着要下地来。</p>“不，"她坦率地说。"脏着呢。”<p>“我怎么了？”</p>“有股臭味。艾希礼叔叔没有臭味。”</div></div>
    
  <div class="layout">
  <div class="left">“Well, I’ll be damned,” he said ruefully, putting her on the floor. “I never expected to find a temperance advocate in my own home, of all places!”
<p>But, thereafter, he limited his drinking to a glass of wine after supper. Bonnie, who was always permitted to have the last drops in the glass, did not think the smell of wine nasty at all. As the result, the puffiness which had begun to obscure the hard lines of his cheeks slowly disappeared and the circles beneath his black eyes were not so dark or so harshly cut. Because Bonnie liked to ride on the front of his saddle, he stayed out of doors more and the sunburn began to creep across his dark face, making him swarthier than ever. He looked healthier and laughed more and was again like the dashing young blockader who had excited Atlanta early in the war.</p>People who had never liked him came to smile as he went by with the small figure perched before him on his saddle. Women who had heretofore believed that no woman was safe with him, began to stop and talk with him on the streets, to admire Bonnie. Even the strictest old ladies felt that a man who could discuss the ailments and problems of childhood as well as he did could not be altogether bad.
</div>
  <div class="right">“唔，我真该死，"他懊悔地说，一面把她放在地上。"我还从没想到竟然我自己家里会有个提倡戒酒的人呢！"<p>不过从那以后，他就限制自己晚饭后只喝一杯葡萄酒了。邦妮是被允许喝他杯子里剩下的那一点的，她一点也不觉得葡萄酒有什么臭味。这样一来，他面颊上那两块开始隆起的胖堆儿就渐渐消失，那双黑眼睛下面的两个圈圈也不再显得那么黯淡而深陷了。由于邦妮喜欢坐在他的马鞍前头外出，他现在骑马在外边游荡的时间也多了起来，结果脸孔晒得黑黑的，肤色也比以前深了不少。他看来已更加健康，也更加快活了。</p>每当他骑着马，鞍前带着那个小女孩从旁边走过时，那些原先讨厌他的人现在都开始露出了微笑。那些以前一直认为没有哪个女人跟他在一起不出乱子的妇女，如今也常常在大街上停下来跟他交谈，称赞邦妮几句。甚至有几位最古板的老太太都觉得，一个能像他这样的细心的商讨孩子的毛病和问题的男人，是不可能坏到哪里去的。</div></div>
