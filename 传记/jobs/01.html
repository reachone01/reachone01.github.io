<h3>The Adoption</h3>

<p>When Paul Jobs was  mustered out of the Coast Guard after World War II, he made a wager with his  crewmates. They had arrived in San    Francisco, where their ship was decommissioned, and  Paul bet that he would find himself a wife within two weeks. He was a taut, tattooed  engine mechanic, six feet tall, with a passing resemblance to James Dean. But  it wasn’t his looks that got him a date with Clara Hagopian, a sweet-humored  daughter of Armenian immigrants. It was the fact that he and his friends had a  car, unlike the group she had originally planned to go out with that evening.  Ten days later, in March 1946, Paul got engaged to Clara and won his wager. It  would turn out to be a happy marriage, one that lasted until death parted them  more than forty years later.</p></div>

<h3>领养</h3>

<p>第二次世界大战后，保罗·乔布斯从海岸警卫队退伍时，与他的队员们打了一个赌。他们到达旧金山，在这里，他们的舰船退役了，保罗打赌说他要在两周之内给自己找到一个妻子。他是个肌肉发达、有着文身的引擎机械师，6英尺高，长相酷似詹姆斯·迪恩（JamesDean）。他约到了克拉拉·哈戈皮安（ClaraHagopian）,一个出身亚美尼亚移民家庭的甜美风趣的女孩子。女孩看上的并不是他的容貌，而是他和他的朋友们可以使用一辆轿车，这是她当晚原计划的出行对象们做不到的。10天以后，1946年3月，保罗与克拉拉订婚，同时也赢得了他的赌注。事实证明这是一段幸福的婚姻，两人厮守了40多年，直至死亡将他们分开。</p>

</div></div>

<p>Paul Reinhold Jobs had  been raised on a dairy farm in Germantown, Wisconsin. Even though his father  was an alcoholic and sometimes abusive, Paul ended up with a gentle and calm  disposition under his leathery exterior. After dropping out of high school, he  wandered through the Midwest picking up work  as a mechanic until, at age nineteen, he joined the Coast Guard, even though he  didn’t know how to swim. He was deployed on the USS General M. C. Meigs and  spent much of the war ferrying troops to Italy for General Patton. His  talent as a machinist and fireman earned him commendations, but he occasionally  found himself in minor trouble and never rose above the rank of seaman.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>保罗·莱因霍尔德·乔布斯（PaulRdnholdJobs）在威斯康星州日耳曼敦的一家奶牛场长大。尽管父亲是个酒鬼，有时候还会虐待他，但在保罗粗犷的外表下还是有着一颗温柔宁静的心。髙中退学后，他穿梭于中西部地区，做着机械师的工作，直到19岁那年加入海岸警卫队——虽然他并不会游泳。他被安排在美国海军的梅格斯号运兵船（USSM.C.Meigs）上，战争中的大多数时间都在为巴顿将军向意大利运输部队。他作为一名机械师和锅炉工的天赋为他赢得了不少奖励，但他偶尔也会惹上一点儿小麻烦，所以军衔从来没有高过一等兵。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Clara was born in New Jersey, where her parents had landed after fleeing  the Turks in Armenia,  and they moved to the Mission District of San Francisco when she was a child.  She had a secret that she rarely mentioned to anyone: She had been married  before, but her husband had been killed in the war. So when she met Paul Jobs  on that first date, she was primed to start a new life.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>克拉拉出生在新泽西州，这里也是她的父母逃离土耳其控制下的亚美尼亚之后落脚的地方。在她童年时，全家搬到了旧金山的米申区。她有一个很少对外提及的秘密：她曾经结过婚，但她的丈夫在战争中身亡了。所以当她第一次和保罗约会时，心中已经准备好迎接崭新的生活了。</p></div></div>

<div class="layout"><div class="left"><p>Like many who lived  through the war, they had experienced enough excitement that, when it was over,  they desired simply to settle down, raise a family, and lead a less eventful  life. They had little money, so they moved to Wisconsin  and lived with Paul’s parents for a few years, then headed for Indiana, where he got a  job as a machinist for International Harvester. His passion was tinkering with  old cars, and he made money in his spare time buying, restoring, and selling  them. Eventually he quit his day job to become a full-time used car salesman.</p></div>

<div class="right"><p>如同许多经历过战争的人一样，他们已经经历了太多的刺激，所以当战争结束之后，他们渴望安定下来，生儿育女，过平静的生活。他们没有多少钱，所以搬到威斯康星州与保罗的父母一起居住了几年，然后又去了印第安纳州，在那里，保罗找到了一份工作——在国际收割机公司（InternationalHarvester）做机械师。他喜欢修理汽车，业余时间他靠买下旧车，修好后再卖出去赚钱。最终，他辞去了工作，成了一名全职的二手车商人。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Clara, however, loved San Francisco, and in 1952  she convinced her husband to move back there. They got an apartment in the  Sunset District facing the Pacific, just south of Golden Gate Park,  and he took a job working for a finance company as a “repo man,” picking the  locks of cars whose owners hadn’t paid their loans and repossessing them. He  also bought, repaired, and sold some of the cars, making a decent enough living  in the process.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>然而，克拉拉深爱着旧金山。1952年，她终于说服丈夫，全家搬回了旧金山。他们在日落区买下了一套公寓，地处金门公园南端，面朝太平洋。保罗在一家信贷公司找到了一份“回收人”的工作——撬开不能偿还贷款的车主的车锁，将车拖回，重新处置。有时候他也会买下这样的车，修好后出售，靠赚到的钱过着小康生活。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was, however,  something missing in their lives. They wanted children, but Clara had suffered  an <a href="#" title="美 [ek'tɑpɪk]
英 [ek'tɒpɪk]
    adj.（妊娠）异位的">ectopic</a> pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg was implanted in a <a href="#" title="法罗皮奥氏；输卵；面神经管">fallopian</a>  tube rather than the uterus, and she had been unable to have any. So by 1955,  after nine years of marriage, they were looking to adopt a child.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>但他们的生活中却始终缺少一样东西。他们想要孩子，但克拉拉经历过一次宫外孕而丧失了生育能力。到1955年，在结婚9年后，他们开始寻求领养一个孩子。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Like Paul Jobs, Joanne  Schieble was from a rural Wisconsin family of  German heritage. Her father, Arthur Schieble, had immigrated to the outskirts  of Green Bay,  where he and his wife owned a mink farm and dabbled successfully in various  other businesses, including real estate and photoengraving. He was very strict,  especially regarding his daughter’s relationships, and he had strongly  disapproved of her first love, an artist who was not a Catholic. Thus it was no  surprise that he threatened to cut Joanne off completely when, as a graduate  student at the University of Wisconsin, she fell in love with Abdulfattah “John”  Jandali, a Muslim teaching assistant from Syria.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>与保罗·乔布斯一样，乔安妮·席贝尔（JoanneSchieble）也来自威斯康星乡村的一个德裔家庭。她的父亲，亚瑟·席贝尔（ArthurSchieble），移民美国后辗转来到了格林贝（GreenBay）的郊区。他和妻子在这里拥有一家水貂饲养场，还成功涉足了其他一些生意，从房地产到光刻。他很严厉，尤其是在对待女儿的恋爱问题上，他强烈反对女儿和初恋对象的交往，因为此人不是天主教徒。所以，当在威斯康星大学读研究生的乔安妮爱上了一个来自叙利亚的穆斯林助教，“约翰”阿卜杜勒法塔赫·钱德里（Abdulfattah“John”Jandali）时，他威胁要与她断绝关系，就一点儿也不让人惊讶了。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jandali was the  youngest of nine children in a prominent Syrian family. His father owned oil  refineries and multiple other businesses, with large holdings in <a href="#" title="美 [də'mæskəs]
英 [də'mæskəs]

    n.大马士革；【城】大马士革">Damascus</a> and Homs,  and at one point pretty much controlled the price of wheat in the region. His  mother, he later said, was a “traditional Muslim woman” who was a  “conservative, obedient housewife.” Like the Schieble family, the Jandalis put  a premium on education. Abdulfattah was sent to a Jesuit boarding school, even  though he was Muslim, and he got an undergraduate degree at the American University  in Beirut before entering the University of Wisconsin  to pursue a doctoral degree in political science.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>钱德里来自一个显赫的叙利亚家庭，是家里9个孩子中年纪最小的一个。他的父亲拥有多家炼油厂和其他多重产业，在大马士革和霍姆斯也有大量财产，还一度控制了那一地区的小麦价格。和席贝尔家一样，钱德里家族十分重视教育，好几代以来，家庭成员都被送到伊斯坦布尔或者巴黎索邦大学就读。阿卜杜勒法塔赫·钱德里就曾被送到一所耶稣会寄宿学校，尽管他是个穆斯林。他在位于贝鲁特的美国大学（AmericanUniversity）拿到了学士学位，然后来到了威斯康星大学，在政治学系攻读硕士并担任助教。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In the summer of 1954,  Joanne went with Abdulfattah to Syria.  They spent two months in Homs,  where she learned from his family to cook Syrian dishes. When they returned to Wisconsin she discovered  that she was pregnant. They were both twenty-three, but they decided not to get  married. Her father was dying at the time, and he had threatened to disown her  if she wed Abdulfattah. Nor was abortion an easy option in a small Catholic  community. So in early 1955, Joanne traveled to San Francisco, where she was taken into the  care of a kindly doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies,  and quietly arranged closed adoptions.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>1954年的夏天，乔安妮和阿卜杜勒法塔赫一起去了叙利亚。他们在霍姆斯待了两个月，乔安妮从男友的家人那里学会了做叙利亚菜。他们回到威斯康星后，乔安妮发现自己怀孕了。当年他们都是23岁，但决定不结婚。乔安妮的父亲当时已经快死了，他威胁她说，如果她跟阿卜杜勒法塔赫结婚，他就跟她断绝父女关系。在他们那个小小的天主教社区，堕胎也绝不是一件容易的事情。1955年初，乔安妮来到旧金山，被一名好心的医生收留，这位医生为未婚的准妈妈们提供庇护，帮她们接生，然后安排秘密的收养。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Joanne had one  requirement: Her child must be adopted by college graduates. So the doctor  arranged for the baby to be placed with a lawyer and his wife. But when a boy  was born—on February 24, 1955—the designated couple decided that they wanted a  girl and backed out. Thus it was that the boy became the son not of a lawyer  but of a high school dropout with a passion for mechanics and his  salt-of-the-earth wife who was working as a bookkeeper. Paul and Clara named  their new baby Steven Paul Jobs.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔安妮立下了一条规定：领养她孩子的人必须是大学毕业生。所以医生将这个孩子安排给了一位律师和他的妻子。1955年2月24日这一天，乔安妮生下了一个男孩。而安排好的那对夫妇希望领养的是女孩，所以他们退出了。因此，这个男孩没能成为律师的儿子，而是成为了一个高中退学生的儿子，这个人对机械有着极髙的热情，还有一个身为记账员的谦逊的妻子。保罗和克拉拉给孩子取名为史蒂文·保罗·乔布斯①。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Joanne found out  that her baby had been placed with a couple who had not even graduated from  high school, she refused to sign the adoption papers. The standoff lasted  weeks, even after the baby had settled into the Jobs household. Eventually  Joanne relented, with the stipulation that the couple promise—indeed sign a  pledge—to fund a savings account to pay for the boy’s college education.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>但是，乔安妮关于孩子的养父母必须是大学毕业生的要求并没有改变。当她发现这对夫妇甚至连髙中都没有念完时，她拒绝在领养文件上签字。僵局持续了数周，即便史蒂夫已经在乔布斯家安定下来了。最终，乔安妮放宽了要求：乔布斯夫妇必须承诺——在一份保证书上签字——设立专款，送这个孩子上大学。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was another  reason that Joanne was balky about signing the adoption papers. Her father was  about to die, and she planned to marry Jandali soon after. She held out hope,  she would later tell family members, sometimes tearing up at the memory, that  once they were married, she could get their baby boy back.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔安妮迟迟不愿在领养文件上签字还有一个原因。她的父亲快死了，而她计划在父亲死后与钱德里结婚。她还怀有一丝希望——一旦他们结婚，她就可以把儿子要回来。因为有时候想到儿子的事还是会浪伤心，她准备日后向家人和盘托出。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Arthur Schieble died  in August 1955, after the adoption was finalized. Just after Christmas that  year, Joanne and Abdulfattah were married in St. Philip the Apostle Catholic  Church in Green Bay.  He got his PhD in international politics the next year, and then they had  another child, a girl named Mona. After she and Jandali divorced in 1962,  Joanne embarked on a dreamy and peripatetic life that her daughter, who grew up  to become the acclaimed novelist Mona Simpson, would capture in her book  Anywhere but Here. Because Steve’s adoption had been closed, it would be twenty  years before they would all find each other.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>结果，亚瑟·席贝尔死于1955年8月，是领养程序结束后的几个星期。那年的圣诞节刚结束，乔安妮和阿卜杜勒法塔赫·钱德里就在格林贝的使徒圣菲利普天主教堂（St.PhiliptheApostleCatholicChurch）完婚了。第二年，钱德里拿到了国际政治学的博士学位，他们生了另一个孩子，女孩，名叫莫娜。1962年和钱德里离婚后，乔安妮过上了梦一般游荡的生活，这些都被她女儿——后来成为杰出小说家的莫娜·辛普森——描绘在她的凄美小说《在别处》（AnywhereButHere）中。因为史蒂夫的领养程序是非常私密的,所以直到20年后，他们才得以相认。</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Steve Jobs knew from  an early age that he was adopted. “My parents were very open with me about  that,” he recalled. He had a vivid memory of sitting on the lawn of his house,  when he was six or seven years old, telling the girl who lived across the  street. “So does that mean your real parents didn’t want you?” the girl asked.  “Lightning bolts went off in my head,” according to Jobs. “I remember running  into the house, crying. And my parents said, ‘No, you have to understand.’ They  were very serious and looked me straight in the eye. They said, ‘We  specifically picked you out.’ Both of my parents said that and repeated it  slowly for me. And they put an emphasis on every word in that sentence.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>史蒂夫·乔布斯很早就知道了自己是被领养的。“我的父母在这件事情上对我很坦率。”他回忆道。他记得很清楚，六七岁的时候，他坐在自家屋前的草地上，向住在街对面的女孩讲述这件事情。“这是不是说明你的亲生父母不要你了？”女孩问。“大哪，我当时就像被闪电击中了一样,”乔布斯这么说,“我跑回家，大声哭喊。我父母说：‘不是这样的，你要理解这件事情。’他们当时很严肃，直直地看着我的眼睛。他们说：‘我们是专门挑的你。’他们两人都这么说，并且放慢语速向我重复这句话。他们强调了这句话里的每一个字。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Abandoned. Chosen.  Special. Those concepts became part of who Jobs was and how he regarded  himself. His closest friends think that the knowledge that he was given up at  birth left some scars. “I think his desire for complete control of whatever he  makes derives directly from his personality and the fact that he was abandoned  at birth,” said one longtime colleague, Del Yocam. “He wants to control his  environment, and he sees the product as an extension of himself.” Greg Calhoun,  who became close to Jobs right after college, saw another effect. “Steve talked  to me a lot about being abandoned and the pain that caused,” he said. “It made  him independent. He followed the beat of a different drummer, and that came  from being in a different world than he was born into.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>被遗弃。被选择。很特别。这些概念成为了乔布斯的一部分，也影响了他对自己的看法。他最亲密的朋友们认为，一出生就被遗弃这个事实给他留下了几道伤疤。“我想，他想完全掌控自己制造的每一样东西的那种强烈欲望，就来源于他的性格以及刚出生就被抛弃这件事。”跟乔布斯共事了很多年的德尔·约克姆（DelYocam）这么说。格雷格·卡尔霍恩（GregCalhoun）看到了另一种影响，“他想控制外界环境，而且他把产品看做自己的一种延伸。”格雷格大学毕业后就与乔布斯关系密切。“史蒂夫跟我讲了很多他被亲生父母遗弃及其造成的伤害，”他说，“这件事形成了他独立的性格。他遵循着另外一套行为方式，这是因为他生活在自己的小世界里——与他的生长环境截然不同的世界。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Later in life, when he  was the same age his biological father had been when he abandoned him, Jobs  would father and abandon a child of his own. (He eventually took responsibility  for her.) Chrisann Brennan, the mother of that child, said that being put up  for adoption left Jobs “full of broken glass,” and it helps to explain some of  his behavior. “He who is abandoned is an abandoner,” she said. Andy Hertzfeld,  who worked with Jobs at Apple in the early 1980s, is among the few who remained  close to both Brennan and Jobs. “The key question about Steve is why he can’t  control himself at times from being so <a href="#" title="美 [rɪ'fleksɪv]
英 [rɪ'fleksɪv]
    adj.反身的（词或词形）
    n.【语】反身动词[代词]">reflexively</a> cruel and harmful to some  people,” he said. “That goes back to being abandoned at birth. The real  underlying problem was the theme of abandonment in Steve’s life.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>后来，乔布斯23岁时——这正是他的生父拋弃他时的年纪——乔布斯有了自己的孩子并抛弃了她。（最后他还是承担了作为一个父亲的责任。）孩子的母亲克里斯安·布伦南（ChrisannBrennan）说，被领养一事让乔布斯“满是伤痕”，这也解释了他后来的行为。“他曾经被遗弃过，但后来他也遗弃了别人。”克里斯安如是说。20世纪80年代与乔布斯一起在苹果公司密切合作过的安迪·赫茨菲尔德（AndyHertzfeld），是少数几个与乔布斯和布伦南两者都保持紧密联系的人。“史蒂夫身上的关键问题是，为什么他有时候会失控般变得残酷并伤害别人，”他说，“那还要追溯到他一出生便被遗弃这件事上。真正的潜在问题是，史蒂夫的生活中，永远有‘被遗弃’这样一个主题。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs dismissed this.  “There’s some notion that because I was abandoned, I worked very hard so I  could do well and make my parents wish they had me back, or some such nonsense,  but that’s ridiculous,” he insisted. “Knowing I was adopted may have made me feel  more independent, but I have never felt abandoned. I’ve always felt special. My  parents made me feel special.” He would later bristle whenever anyone referred  to Paul and Clara Jobs as his “adoptive” parents or implied that they were not  his “real” parents. “They were my parents 1,000%,” he said. When speaking about  his biological parents, on the other hand, he was curt: “They were my sperm and  egg bank. That’s not harsh, it’s just the way it was, a sperm bank thing,  nothing more.”</p>
</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯否认了这点。“有些人认为，因为我被父母抛弃过，所以我非常努力地工作以求出人头地，这样我父母就会后悔当初的决定，还有一些类似的言论，都太荒谬了，”他坚称，“知道自己是被领养的也许让我感觉更加独立，但我从未感觉自己被抛弃过。我一直都觉得自己很特别。我的父母让我觉得自己很特别。”之后，每当有人称保罗和克拉拉为乔布斯的“养父母”或者暗示他们不是他的“亲生父母”时，他就会异常愤怒。“他们百分之一千是我的父母。”他说。另一方面，当谈及他的亲生父母时，他显得很草率：“他们就是我的精子库和卵子库，这话并不过分，因为这就是事实，他们扮演的就是精子库的角色，仅此而已。”——</p>

<div class="left"><h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>Silicon   Valley</h3>
<p>The childhood that  Paul and Clara Jobs created for their new son was, in many ways, a stereotype  of the late 1950s. When Steve was two they adopted a girl they named Patty, and  three years later they moved to a tract house in the suburbs. The finance  company where Paul worked as a repo man, CIT, had transferred him down to its Palo Alto office, but he could not afford to live there,  so they landed in a subdivision in Mountain    View, a less expensive town just to the south.</p></div>
<div class="right">
<h3>硅谷</h3>
<p>保罗和克拉拉夫妇为他们的儿子创造的童年，从很多方面来说，都是20世纪50年代后期的典型模式。乔布斯两岁那年，他们领养了一个女儿，取名为帕蒂，3年后他们搬到了郊区的一栋房子里。保罗担任“回收人”的CIT信贷公司将他调到了帕洛奥图的办事处，但他承受不起那里高昂的生活费用，所以他们选择了在南边的山景城落脚，那里的生活开销相对低廉。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There Paul tried to  pass along his love of mechanics and cars. “Steve, this is your workbench now,”  he said as he marked off a section of the table in their garage. Jobs  remembered being impressed by his father’s focus on craftsmanship. “I thought  my dad’s sense of design was pretty good,” he said, “because he knew how to  build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our  fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>保罗·乔布斯想把自己对机械和汽车的热爱传递给儿子。“史蒂夫，从现在开始这就是你的工作台了。”他边说边在车库里的桌子上划出一块。乔布斯还记得父亲对手工技艺的专注曾让自己印象深刻。“我觉得爸爸的设计感很好，”他说，“因为他什么都会做。要是家里缺个柜子，他就会做一个。给家里搭栅栏的时候，他给我一把锤子，这样我就能跟他一起干活儿了。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Fifty years later the  fence still surrounds the back and side yards of the house in Mountain View. As Jobs showed it off to me,  he caressed the stockade panels and recalled a lesson that his father implanted  deeply in him. It was important, his father said, to craft the backs of  cabinets and fences properly, even though they were hidden. “He loved doing things  right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn’t see.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>50年后，当年的栅栏依然包围着山景城那处房子与院落。乔布斯向我展示的时候，轻抚着栅栏的木板，回想起了父亲深深植入他脑中的一课。老乔布斯说，把柜子和栅栏的背面制作好也十分重要，尽管这些地方人们是看不到的。“他喜欢追求完美，即使别人看不到的地方他也会很关心。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His father continued  to refurbish and resell used cars, and he festooned the garage with pictures of  his favorites. He would point out the detailing of the design to his son: the  lines, the vents, the chrome, the trim of the seats. After work each day, he  would change into his dungarees and retreat to the garage, often with Steve  tagging along. “I figured I could get him nailed down with a little mechanical  ability, but he really wasn’t interested in getting his hands dirty,” Paul  later recalled. “He never really cared too much about mechanical things.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>父亲继续着翻新、出售二手车的事业，并在车库里贴满了他喜爱的汽车的图片。他会向儿子介绍车辆设计的细节——线条、排气孔、铬合金以及座椅的装饰。每天下班后，他就换上工作服，窝在车库里，史蒂夫也常常跟着他。“我原本想让他掌握一点儿机械方面的技能，但他不愿意把手弄脏，”保罗后来回忆说，“他从没有真正喜欢过机械方面的东西。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><p>“I wasn’t that into  fixing cars,” Jobs admitted. “But I was eager to hang out with my dad.” Even as  he was growing more aware that he had been adopted, he was becoming more  attached to his father. One day when he was about eight, he discovered a  photograph of his father from his time in the Coast Guard. “He’s in the engine  room, and he’s got his shirt off and looks like James Dean. It was one of those  Oh wow moments for a kid. Wow, oooh, my parents were actually once very young  and really good-looking.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>在引擎盖下修修补补根本吸引不了乔布斯。“我对修汽车没什么兴趣。但我特别喜欢跟爸爸待在一起。”即使随着年龄的增长，他越来越意识到自己是被领养的，他还是越来越喜欢跟爸爸黏在一起。乔布斯差不多8岁的时候，有一天他发现了一张父亲在海岸警卫队时的照片。“他在轮机舱里，上身赤裸，看上去很像詹姆斯·迪恩。对一个孩子来说，那一刻只能用‘哇，天哪’来形容了。哇，天哪！我的父母也曾经年轻过，而且长相也很不错。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Through cars, his  father gave Steve his first exposure to electronics. “My dad did not have a  deep understanding of electronics, but he’d encountered it a lot in automobiles  and other things he would fix. He showed me the rudiments of electronics, and I  got very interested in that.” Even more interesting were the trips to scavenge  for parts. “Every weekend, there’d be a junkyard trip. We’d be looking for a  generator, a carburetor, all sorts of components.” He remembered watching his  father negotiate at the counter. “He was a good bargainer, because he knew  better than the guys at the counter what the parts should cost.” This helped  fulfill the pledge his parents made when he was adopted. “My college fund came  from my dad paying $50 for a Ford Falcon or some other beat-up car that didn’t  run, working on it for a few weeks, and selling it for $250—and not telling the  IRS.”</p></div>

<p>通过汽车，父亲让史蒂夫第一次接触到了电子设备。“他对电子设备并没有很深的了解，但他经常在汽车以及其他修理对象上跟电子设备打交道。他为我展示了电子设备的基本原理，我觉得很有趣。”更有趣的是去废品堆里寻找零部件的过程。“每个周末，我们都会进行一次废品站之旅。我们会寻找发电机，或者化油器，还有各种各样的元件。”他还记得看着父亲在柜台前谈价格。“他很揸长讨价还价，因为他比卖家更清楚零件的合理价格。”这一点对于实现他父母当初领养他时许下的承诺很有帮助。“我上大学的钱是这么来的：我父亲会花50美元买下一辆已经开不动的福特猎鹰（FordFalcon）或者其他什么破车，花几个星期修好它，然后以250美元的价格卖出去——而且他不会去报税。”</p>

<p>The Jobses’ house and  the others in their neighborhood were built by the real estate developer Joseph  Eichler, whose company spawned more than eleven thousand homes in various California subdivisions  between 1950 and 1974. Inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision of simple modern  homes for the American “everyman,” Eichler built inexpensive houses that  featured floor-to-ceiling glass walls, open floor plans, exposed post-and-beam  construction, concrete slab floors, and lots of sliding glass doors. “Eichler  did a great thing,” Jobs said on one of our walks around the neighborhood. “His  houses were smart and cheap and good. They brought clean design and simple  taste to lower-income people. They had awesome little features, like radiant  heating in the floors. You put carpet on them, and we had nice toasty floors  when we were kids.”</p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>乔布斯家的房子位于迪亚布洛大道286号，和他们周围的房子一样，都是由房地产开发商约瑟夫·埃奇勒（JosephEichler）建造的，他的公司于19501974年间，在加州的各个地区兴建了超过11000座房屋。受到弗兰克·劳埃德·赖特（FrankLloydWright）“适合美国普通百姓的简单现代之家”这一设想的启发，埃奇勒建造了廉价房屋，这些房屋的特点是：落地的玻璃墙、开放式的平面设计、无遮蔽的梁柱构造、混凝土地面以及大量的滑动玻璃门。“埃奇勒做得很好，”乔布斯有一次和我在附近散步时说，“他造的房子整洁漂亮，价格低廉，质量优秀。他们把干净的设计和简洁的品位帯给了低收入人群。房子本身有很棒的小特色，比如地板下安装了热辐射供暧设施。我们小的时候，铺上地毯，躺在上面，温暧舒适。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs said that his  appreciation for Eichler homes instilled in him a passion for making nicely  designed products for the mass market. “I love it when you can bring really  great design and simple capability to something that doesn’t cost much,” he  said as he pointed out the clean elegance of the houses. “It was the original  vision for Apple. That’s what we tried to do with the first Mac. That’s what we  did with the iPod.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯说，他对埃奇勒建造的房屋的欣赏，激发了他为大众制造设计精良的产品的热情。“我喜欢把很棒的设计和简便的功能融入产品中，而且不会太贵，”他一边向我指出这些房屋的干净典雅之处，一边说道，“这是苹果公司最初的设想，我们在制造第一台Mac电脑时就尝试这么做，并在iPod上实现了这个设想。”</p>

<p>Across the street from  the Jobs family lived a man who had become successful as a real estate agent.  “He wasn’t that bright,” Jobs recalled, “but he seemed to be making a fortune.  So my dad thought, ‘I can do that.’ He worked so hard, I remember. He took  these night classes, passed the license test, and got into real estate. Then  the bottom fell out of the market.” As a result, the family found itself  financially strapped for a year or so while Steve was in elementary school. His  mother took a job as a bookkeeper for Varian Associates, a company that made  scientific instruments, and they took out a second mortgage. One day his  fourth-grade teacher asked him, “What is it you don’t understand about the  universe?” Jobs replied, “I don’t understand why all of a sudden my dad is so  broke.” He was proud that his father never adopted a servile attitude or slick  style that may have made him a better salesman. “You had to suck up to people  to sell real estate, and he wasn’t good at that and it wasn’t in his nature. I  admired him for that.” Paul Jobs went back to being a mechanic.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯家的对面曾经住着一个成功的房地产经纪人。“他也不是很聪明，”乔布斯回忆说，“但看起来他好像赚了不少钱。于是我爸爸就想：‘我也能干这一行啊。’我记得他拼命努力，去上夜校，通过了执照考试，进入了房地产业。紧接着，房地产市场崩溃了。”结果，乔布斯一家经济拮据了差不多一年时间，当时史蒂夫还在上小学。他妈妈在生产科学仪器的瓦里安联合公司（VarianAssociates）找到了一份记账员的工作，他们家也给房子办理了第二份抵押贷款。有一天，他的四年级老师问他：“关于这个世界，你有什么不明白的？”乔布斯回答说：“我不明白为什么我爸爸一夜之间就破产了。”虽然如此，乔布斯还是很为父亲感到骄傲，因为他从来没有学会那种卑躬屈膝的态度和圆滑诡诈的作风，尽管这些特质能让他成为一个业绩更好的经纪人。“想卖出房子，你就必须巴结别人，爸爸不擅长这个，他本性也不是这样的人。这一点我很钦佩他。”保罗·乔布斯做回了老本行——机械师。</p>

<p>His father was calm  and gentle, traits that his son later praised more than emulated. He was also  resolute. Jobs described one example:</p></div>

<p>Nearby was an engineer  who was working at Westinghouse. He was a single guy, beatnik type. He had a  girlfriend. She would babysit me sometimes. Both my parents worked, so I would  come here right after school for a couple of hours. He would get drunk and hit  her a couple of times. She came over one night, scared out of her wits, and he  came over drunk, and my dad stood him down—saying “She’s here, but you’re not  coming in.” He stood right there. We like to think everything was idyllic in  the 1950s, but this guy was one of those engineers who had messed-up lives.</p></div>

<p>What made the  neighborhood different from the thousands of other <a href="#" title="adj.长而纤弱的；细长而瘦弱的
n.细长物；瘦高个子">spindly</a>-tree subdivisions  across America  was that even the ne’er-do-wells tended to be engineers. “When we moved here,  there were apricot and plum orchards on all of these corners,” Jobs recalled.  “But it was beginning to boom because of military investment.” He soaked up the  history of the valley and developed a yearning to play his own role. Edwin Land  of Polaroid later told him about being asked by Eisenhower to help build the  U-2 spy plane cameras to see how real the Soviet threat was. The film was  dropped in canisters and returned to the NASA  Ames Research  Center in Sunnyvale, not far from where Jobs lived.  “The first computer terminal I ever saw was when my dad brought me to the Ames Center,”  he said. “I fell totally in love with it.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>这个地区与遍布美国的千千万万个绿树浓荫的地区不同的一点是，即便是个一无所长的人也想成为工程师。“我们搬到这里时，每个角落都能看到杏子和李子果园乔布斯回忆说，“但因为军事投资的关系，整个地区开始急速发展起来。”乔布斯受到眭谷历史的浸淫，渴望自己也能施展拳脚。宝丽来的埃德温·兰德后来告诉他，艾森豪威尔曾要求自己帮助制造U-2侦察机上的照相机，来监视苏联的威胁。胶卷被装在小罐子里，然后送到森尼韦尔的美国国家航空航天局埃姆斯研究中心（NASAAmesResearchCenter）,这里离乔布斯家不远。“我第一次见到计算机终端，就是我爸爸带我去埃姆斯中心的时候他说，“我觉得自己彻底爰上它了。”</p>

<p>Other defense  contractors sprouted nearby during the 1950s. The Lockheed Missiles and Space  Division, which built submarine-launched ballistic missiles, was founded in  1956 next to the NASA Center; by the time Jobs moved to the area four years  later, it employed twenty thousand people. A few hundred yards away,  Westinghouse built facilities that produced tubes and electrical transformers  for the missile systems. “You had all these military companies on the cutting  edge,” he recalled. “It was mysterious and high-tech and made living here very  exciting.”</p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>其他的国防项目承包商也于20世纪50年代陆续在周边地区落地生根。1956年，生产潜射弹道导弹的洛克希德公司导弹与空间部门（The Lockheed Missilesand Space Division）在NASA中心隔壁成立；4年后乔布斯一家搬到这里时，该部门已经雇用了20000名员工。几百米之外就是西屋电气公司，其生产的设备是用来为导弹系统制造电子管和变压器的。“拥有尖端科技的军事公司云集于此，”他回忆道，“这太不可思议、太髙科技了，生活在这里真让人觉得兴奋。”</p>

<p>In the wake of the  defense industries there arose a booming economy based on technology. Its roots  stretched back to 1938, when David Packard and his new wife moved into a house  in Palo Alto that  had a shed where his friend Bill Hewlett was soon ensconced. The house had a  garage—an appendage that would prove both useful and iconic in the valley—in  which they tinkered around until they had their first product, an audio  oscillator. By the 1950s, Hewlett-Packard was a fast-growing company making  technical instruments.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>国防工业的复苏，引发了一场依托科技的经济急速发展。这场发展的根基还要回溯到1938年，当时戴维·帕卡德和他的新婚妻子搬进了帕洛奥图的一座公寓，很快他的朋友比尔·休利特也在这座公寓的一个小屋里安顿了下来。房子有一间车库——这间车库后来成为了硅谷的标志之一——在这里，他们敲敲打打，制造出了自己的第一件产品：一台音频振荡器。到20世纪50年代，惠普已经成为一家制造技术仪器的快速成长的公司。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Fortunately there was  a place nearby for entrepreneurs who had outgrown their garages. In a move that  would help transform the area into the cradle of the tech revolution, Stanford University’s dean of engineering,  Frederick Terman, created a seven-hundred-acre industrial park on university  land for private companies that could commercialize the ideas of his students.  Its first tenant was Varian Associates, where Clara Jobs worked. “Terman came  up with this great idea that did more than anything to cause the tech industry  to grow up here,” Jobs said. By the time Jobs was ten, HP had nine thousand  employees and was the blue-chip company where every engineer seeking financial  stability wanted to work.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>幸运的是，附近有一个地方为那些企业规模已经超出车库的创业者们提供了更大的发展空间。斯坦福大学的工程系主任弗雷德里克·特曼（FrederickTerman）在学校拥有的土地上开辟了一座占地700英亩的工业园区，提供给可以将学生们的创意商业化的私人企业。第一家租户便是瓦里安联合公司，也就是克拉拉·乔布斯工作的地方。“特曼的伟大计划对技术产业在此地发展壮大的推动作用，是其他任何事情都无法比拟的。”乔布斯说。在乔布斯10岁那年，惠普公司已经拥有9000名雇员，并且成为每一个渴望稳定收入的工程师都梦寐以求的一流企业。</p>

<p>The most important  technology for the region’s growth was, of course, the semiconductor. William  Shockley, who had been one of the inventors of the transistor at Bell Labs in  New Jersey, moved out to Mountain View and, in 1956, started a company to build  transistors using silicon rather than the more expensive germanium that was  then commonly used. But Shockley became increasingly erratic and abandoned his  silicon transistor project, which led eight of his engineers—most notably  Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore—to break away to form Fairchild Semiconductor.  That company grew to twelve thousand employees, but it fragmented in 1968, when  Noyce lost a power struggle to become CEO. He took Gordon Moore and founded a  company that they called Integrated Electronics Corporation, which they soon  smartly abbreviated to Intel. Their third employee was Andrew Grove, who later  would grow the company by shifting its focus from memory chips to  microprocessors. Within a few years there would be more than fifty companies in  the area making semiconductors.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>在硅谷的发展中，最重要的一项技术显然是半导体。在新泽西的贝尔实验室期间与人共同发明了晶体管的威廉·肖克利（WilliamShockley），也搬到了山景城，他在1956年创办了一家公司，用硅代替当时普遍使用的也较为昂贵的锗来制造晶体管。但随后肖克利变得越来越乖僻，他放弃了硅晶体管项目，这也导致了他麾下的8名工程师——最著名的有罗伯特·诺伊斯（RobertNoyce）和戈登·摩尔（GordonMoore）——离他而去并创办了仙童半导体公司（FairchildSemiconductor）。该公司发展到了12000人的规模，但是1968年，诺伊斯在一场争夺CEO（首席执行官）宝座的权力斗争中失败后，公司分裂了。诺伊斯带走了戈登·摩尔，创办了集成电路公司（IntegratedElectronicsCorporation）,他们巧妙地将公司简称为“英特尔”（Intel）。他们的第三名员工是安德鲁·格鲁夫（AndrewGrove），他在20世纪80年代通过将业务重心从存储器芯片转移到微处理器上而使公司发展壮大。仅仅几年的时间，这一地区就出现了超过50家生产半导体的公司。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The exponential growth  of this industry was correlated with the phenomenon famously discovered by  Moore, who in 1965 drew a graph of the speed of integrated circuits, based on  the number of transistors that could be placed on a chip, and showed that it  doubled about every two years, a <a href="#" title="美 [trə'dʒektəri]
英 [trə'dʒekt(ə)ri]
    n.轨迹
    弹道；轨道；轨线">trajectory</a> that could be expected to continue.  This was reaffirmed in 1971, when Intel was able to etch a complete central  processing unit onto one chip, the Intel 4004, which was dubbed a  “microprocessor.” Moore’s Law has held generally true to this day, and its  reliable projection of performance to price allowed two generations of young  entrepreneurs, including Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, to create cost projections  for their forward-leaning products.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>半导体产业的爆炸式发展与摩尔发现的著名现象有关，他在1965年绘制的一张图表显示，集成电路每个芯片所能容纳的晶体管数目大约每两年就会翻一番，性能也会提升一倍，而且这一趋势还会继续。这一发现在1971年得到了再一次证实，当时英特尔公司成功地将一个完整的中央处理器蚀刻到了一块芯片上——制成了英特尔4004——他们称之为“微处理器”。摩尔定律直至今日依然基本准确，它对产品性价比的可靠预测让包括史蒂夫·乔布斯和比尔·盖茨在内的两代年轻企业家可以对自己的未来产品作出成本推测。</p>

<p>The chip industry gave  the region a new name when Don Hoefler, a columnist for the weekly trade paper  Electronic News, began a series in January 1971 entitled “Silicon Valley USA.”  The forty-mile Santa Clara Valley, which stretches from South San Francisco  through Palo Alto to San Jose, has as its commercial backbone El Camino Real,  the royal road that once connected California’s twenty-one mission churches and  is now a bustling avenue that connects companies and startups accounting for a third  of the venture capital investment in the United States each year. “Growing up,  I got inspired by the history of the place,” Jobs said. “That made me want to  be a part of it.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>芯片产业赋予该地区一个全新的名字。从1971年1月起，每周发行的专业类报纸《电子新闻》（ElectronicNews）的专栏作家唐·赫夫勒（DonHoefler），开始了一组系列报道，标题为“美国眭谷”。这一綿延40英里的圣克拉拉谷，从南旧金山穿过帕洛奥图，一直延伸到圣何塞，贯穿其中的是该地区的商业主干道国王大道”（ElCaminoReal）,这条道路曾经连接着加州的21所教会，而现在，这条繁忙的道路所连接的企业和新兴公司每年吸引着全美1/3的风险投资。“成长于此，我受到了这里独特历史的启发，”乔布斯说，“这让我很想成为其中的一分子。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Like most kids, he  became infused with the passions of the grown-ups around him. “Most of the dads  in the neighborhood did really neat stuff, like photovoltaics and batteries and  radar,” Jobs recalled. “I grew up in awe of that stuff and asking people about  it.” The most important of these neighbors, Larry Lang, lived seven doors away.  “He was my model of what an HP engineer was supposed to be: a big ham radio  operator, hard-core electronics guy,” Jobs recalled. “He would bring me stuff  to play with.” As we walked up to Lang’s old house, Jobs pointed to the  driveway. “He took a carbon microphone and a battery and a speaker, and he put  it on this driveway. He had me talk into the carbon mike and it amplified out  of the speaker.” Jobs had been taught by his father that microphones always  required an electronic amplifier. “So I raced home, and I told my dad that he  was wrong.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>像大多数孩子一样，他开始受身边大人们的热情影响。“住在我周围的父亲们大都研究的是很酷的东西，比如太阳能光伏电池和雷达，”乔布斯回忆道，“我对这些东西充满了惊奇，经常向他们问这问那。”这些邻居中最重要的一个人，拉里·朗（LarryLang），跟乔布斯家隔了7户人家。“他是我心中惠普工程师的标准形象：超级无线电爱好者、铁杆电子迷，他会带东西给我玩。”当我们走到朗的老房子时，乔布斯指着车道说：“他把一个碳精话筒、一块蓄电池和一个扬声器放在车道上。他让我对着话筒说话，声音就通过扬声器放大出来了。”乔布斯的父亲曾经告诉过他，话筒一定要有电子放大器才能工作。所以我跑回家，告诉父亲他错了。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“No, it needs an  amplifier,” his father assured him. When Steve protested otherwise, his father  said he was crazy. “It can’t work without an amplifier. There’s some trick.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>“不对，肯定需要放大器。”父亲的口气很肯定。当史蒂夫提出异议时，父亲说他疯了。“没有放大器是不可能工作的，这其中是有诀窍的。”</p>

<p>“我不停地对我父亲说不是那样的，让他亲眼去看看，最终他跟我一起走到邻居家，看到了。他说：‘我还是赶紧走人吧。’”</p>

<p>Jobs recalled the  incident vividly because it was his first realization that his father did not  know everything. Then a more <a href="#" title="美 [.dɪskən'sɜrt]
英 [.dɪskən'sɜː(r)t]
    v.使不安；使困惑；使尴尬">disconcerting</a> discovery began to dawn on him: He  was smarter than his parents. He had always admired his father’s competence and  savvy. “He was not an educated man, but I had always thought he was pretty damn  smart. He didn’t read much, but he could do a lot. Almost everything  mechanical, he could figure it out.” Yet the carbon microphone incident, Jobs  said, began a <a href="#" title="美 ['dʒɑrɪŋ]
英 ['dʒɑːrɪŋ]
    n.振动；刺耳声；争执
    adj.刺耳的；不和谐的">jarring</a> process of realizing that he was in fact more clever and  quick than his parents. “It was a very big moment that’s burned into my mind.  When I realized that I was smarter than my parents, I felt tremendous shame for  having thought that. I will never forget that moment.” This discovery, he later  told friends, along with the fact that he was adopted, made him feel  apart—detached and separate—from both his family and the world.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>这件事在乔布斯的心中印象深刻，因为这是他第一次意识到父亲不是万事通。然后，他发现了一件让他更加不安的事情：自己比父母还要聪明。他一直很仰慕父亲的智慧和才能。“他没有受过良好的教育，但我以前一直认为他特别聪明。他不怎么看书，却会做很多事情。机械方面的东西他几乎样样精通。”然而碳精话筒这件事，乔布斯说，让他的想法开始动摇，他意识到自己实际上比父母更聪明、更敏捷。“这种想法出现在脑海中，对我来说是一个重大的时刻。当我意识到自己比父母更聪明时，我为自己有这样的念头而感到异常羞愧。我永远忘不了那一瞬间。”他后来告诉朋友，这个发现，再加上自己是被领养的这个事实，让他觉得自己有些孤立——与世隔绝一般——脱离了父母，也脱离了世界。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Another layer of  awareness occurred soon after. Not only did he discover that he was brighter  than his parents, but he discovered that they knew this. Paul and Clara Jobs  were loving parents, and they were willing to adapt their lives to suit a son  who was very smart—and also willful. They would go to great lengths to  accommodate him. And soon Steve discovered this fact as well. “Both my parents  got me. They felt a lot of responsibility once they sensed that I was special.  They found ways to keep feeding me stuff and putting me in better schools. They  were willing to defer to my needs.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>此后不久，他又意识到了另一件事情。他不仅发现自己比父母聪明，还发现其实父母是知道这一点的。保罗和克拉拉是一对很慈爱的父母，他们愿意改变自己的生活来适应这个非常聪明也非常任性的儿子。他们愿意竭尽全力去适应他，给他特别的对待。很快，史蒂夫也发现了这点。“父母都很了解我。他们意识到我的不同寻常之后就有了很强的责任感。他们想尽办法让我学到更多东西，送我去好学校。他们愿意满足我的需求。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So he grew up not only  with a sense of having once been abandoned, but also with a sense that he was  special. In his own mind, that was more important in the formation of his  personality.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>所以在他长大的过程中，伴随他的不仅仅是曾经被遗弃的感觉，还有一种自己不同于常人的感觉。在他心中，后者在他的个性形成中扮演的角色更为重要。

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left"><h3><a name="s3" id="s3"></a>School</h3>
<p>Even before Jobs  started elementary school, his mother had taught him how to read. This,  however, led to some problems once he got to school. “I was kind of bored for  the first few years, so I occupied myself by getting into trouble.” It also  soon became clear that Jobs, by both nature and nurture, was not disposed to  accept authority. “I encountered authority of a different kind than I had ever  encountered before, and I did not like it. And they really almost got me. They  came close to really beating any curiosity out of me.”</p></div>
<div class="right"><h3>学校</h3>
<p>在乔布斯上小学之前，母亲就已经教他阅读了。但这反而造成了一些麻烦。“在学校的最初几年我觉得很无聊，所以我就不断惹麻烦。”很快大家就发现，不论是从天性还是他接受的教育上，乔布斯都不是一个愿意接受权威的孩子。“我遭遇的是自己从未遇到过的另一种形式的权威，而且我不喜欢它。他们几乎都要制服我了。差一点儿他们就把我身上所有的好奇心都赶走了。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His school, Monta Loma  Elementary, was a series of low-slung 1950s buildings four blocks from his  house. He countered his boredom by playing pranks. “I had a good friend named  Rick Ferrentino, and we’d get into all sorts of trouble,” he recalled. “Like we  made little posters announcing ‘Bring Your Pet to School Day.’ It was crazy,  with dogs chasing cats all over, and the teachers were beside themselves.”  Another time they convinced some kids to tell them the combination numbers for  their bike locks. “Then we went outside and switched all of the locks, and  nobody could get their bikes. It took them until late that night to straighten  things out.” When he was in third grade, the pranks became a bit more  dangerous. “One time we set off an explosive under the chair of our teacher,  Mrs. Thurman. We gave her a nervous twitch.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>他就读的学校，蒙塔·洛马小学，在他家四条街之外，是由一群20世纪50年代的低矮建筑组成的。他靠玩恶作剧来打发自己的无聊。“我有个叫里克·费伦蒂诺（RickFerrentino）的好朋友，我们会惹上各种各样的麻烦，”他回忆说，“比如我们会制作小海报，上面写着‘带宠物上学日’。那太疯狂了，到处都能看到狗撵猫。老师们都气疯了。”还有一次，他们设法让别的孩子说出了自己自行车锁的密码。“然后我们跑出去把所有的锁都调换了位置，没人能骑走自己的车。他们直到那天晚上才解决了问题。”到他三年级的时候，恶作剧开始有了一点儿危险的成分。“有一次，我们在老师瑟曼夫人（Mrs.Thurman）的椅子下面点燃了炸药。她吓得都抽搐了。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Not surprisingly, he  was sent home two or three times before he finished third grade. By then,  however, his father had begun to treat him as special, and in his calm but firm  manner he made it clear that he expected the school to do the same. “Look, it’s  not his fault,” Paul Jobs told the teachers, his son recalled. “If you can’t  keep him interested, it’s your fault.” His parents never punished him for his  transgressions at school. “My father’s father was an alcoholic and whipped him  with a belt, but I’m not sure if I ever got spanked.” Both of his parents, he  added, “knew the school was at fault for trying to make me memorize stupid  stuff rather than stimulating me.” He was already starting to show the  admixture of sensitivity and insensitivity, bristliness and detachment, that  would mark him for the rest of his life.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>不出意料，乔布斯在读完三年级之前被送回家两三次。不过父亲当时已经把他当做特殊的孩子来对待了，他以平静但有力的态度向学校阐明，他希望学校也能这么对待自己的孩子。“听着，这不是他的错，”乔布斯回忆当时父亲是这么对老师说的，“如果你提不起他的兴趣，那是你的错。”乔布斯的记忆中，父母从来没有因为他在学校犯错而惩罚过他。“我父亲的父亲是个酒鬼，还会用皮带抽他，但是我连一巴掌都没有挨过。”他又补充说，他的父母“都知道责任在学校，学校没有激发我学习的兴趣，而是让我去背一些没用的东西”。他开始展现出性格中的多面性，敏感又偶尔迟钝，易怒而又超然，这也是他以后生活中的状态。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When it came time for  him to go into fourth grade, the school decided it was best to put Jobs and  Ferrentino into separate classes. The teacher for the advanced class was a  spunky woman named Imogene Hill, known as “Teddy,” and she became, Jobs said,  “one of the saints of my life.” After watching him for a couple of weeks, she  figured that the best way to handle him was to bribe him. “After school one  day, she gave me this workbook with math problems in it, and she said, ‘I want  you to take it home and do this.’ And I thought, ‘Are you nuts?’ And then she  pulled out one of these giant lollipops that seemed as big as the world. And  she said, ‘When you’re done with it, if you get it mostly right, I will give  you this and five dollars.’ And I handed it back within two days.” After a few  months, he no longer required the bribes. “I just wanted to learn and to please  her.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>等到他即将进入四年级的时候，校方认为最好将乔布斯和费伦蒂诺放到不同的班级里。教高级课程的是一名干劲十足的女教师伊莫金·希尔（ImogeneHill）,人称“泰迪”，用乔布斯的话说，她成为了“我生命中的圣人之一”。在观察了乔布斯几个星期后，她意识到对付他最好的方法就是收买他。“有一天放学后，她给了我一本练习簿，上面都是数学题，她说要我带回家把题目解出来。我心想：‘你是不是疯了？’这时她拿出一只超大的棒棒糖，在我看来地球也不过这么大吧。她说，你把题目做完之后，如果大多数都做对了，我就把这个给你，再送你5美元。我用了不到两天就做完交给她了。”几个月之后，他不想再要奖励了。“我只想学习和让她髙兴。”</p>

<p>She reciprocated by  getting him a hobby kit for grinding a lens and making a camera. “I learned  more from her than any other teacher, and if it hadn’t been for her I’m sure I  would have gone to jail.” It reinforced, once again, the idea that he was  special. “In my class, it was just me she cared about. She saw something in  me.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>她会帮他弄到一些小工具，让他可以做些打磨镜头、制作相机之类的事情。“我从她身上学到的东西比从其他任何老师那儿学到的都要多，如果没有她的话，我一定会坐牢的。”这再一次印证了乔布斯是个特殊的孩子。“在我们班，她只关心我一个人。她在我身上看到了一些东西。”</p>

</div></div>

<p>It was not merely  intelligence that she saw. Years later she liked to show off a picture of that  year’s class on Hawaii Day. Jobs had shown up without the suggested Hawaiian  shirt, but in the picture he is front and center wearing one. He had,  literally, been able to talk the shirt off another kid’s back.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>她看到的不仅是乔布斯的智慧。多年后，她很喜欢展示当年的班级在“夏威夷日”拍的一张照片。那天乔布斯出现的时候没有按要求穿夏威夷衫，但在照片中，他穿着一件夏威夷衫坐在前排中央。原来，他成功说服另一个孩子把自己的衣服脱下来给了他。</p>

<p>Near the end of fourth  grade, Mrs. Hill had Jobs tested. “I scored at the high school sophomore  level,” he recalled. Now that it was clear, not only to himself and his parents  but also to his teachers, that he was intellectually special, the school made  the remarkable proposal that he skip two grades and go right into seventh; it  would be the easiest way to keep him challenged and stimulated. His parents  decided, more sensibly, to have him skip only one grade.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>四年级快结束时，希尔夫人给乔布斯作了测试。“我的得分是髙中二年级水平。”他回忆说。不光是他自己和他的父母，连老师们也发现了，他在智力上真的是非常特别，学校允许他连跳两级，直接升入七年级。这也是可以让他挑战自我并受到激励最简单的方法了。他的父母明智地决定让他只跳一级。</p>


</div></div>

<p>The transition was  wrenching. He was a socially awkward loner who found himself with kids a year  older. Worse yet, the sixth grade was in a different school, Crittenden Middle.  It was only eight blocks from Monta Loma Elementary, but in many ways it was a  world apart, located in a neighborhood filled with ethnic gangs. “Fights were a  daily occurrence; as were shakedowns in bathrooms,” wrote the Silicon Valley  journalist Michael S. Malone. “Knives were regularly brought to school as a  show of macho.” Around the time that Jobs arrived, a group of students were  jailed for a gang rape, and the bus of a neighboring school was destroyed after  its team beat Crittenden’s in a wrestling match.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>这样一种过渡有些突然。这个有点儿社交障碍的不合群的孩子发现自己身处一群比自己大一岁的人中间。更糟糕的是，他读六年级的地方是另一所学校：克里滕登中学。这所学校离原来的蒙塔·洛马小学不过八条街之隔，但在很多方面这里就像另一个世界，这所学校地处一个充斥着少数族裔帮派的社区。“打架几乎天天发生，厕所里的敲诈也是如此，”硅谷记者迈克尔·S·马隆（MichaelS.Malone）这样写道，“学生们经常把刀带到学校来展现自己的男子气概。”乔布斯到这里的时候，一群学生刚因为轮奸而被监禁，隔壁学校因为在一场摔跤比赛中打败了克里滕登而导致己方的校车被毁。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was often  bullied, and in the middle of seventh grade he gave his parents an ultimatum.  “I insisted they put me in a different school,” he recalled. Financially this  was a tough demand. His parents were barely making ends meet, but by this point  there was little doubt that they would eventually bend to his will. “When they  resisted, I told them I would just quit going to school if I had to go back to  Crittenden. So they researched where the best schools were and scraped together  every dime and bought a house for $21,000   in a nicer district.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯经常被欺负，到七年级上到一半的时候，他给父母下达了最后通牒。“我坚持要他们送我去别的学校。”他回忆说。这在经济上对他的父母来说是个艰难的挑战。当时他们家勉强能够收支平衡。但那样的时刻，毫无疑问，父母最终一定会满足他的意愿。“他们一开始反对，我就告诉他们，如果要我回到克里滕登的话，我就再也不上学了。所以他们就调查了一下最好的学校在哪里，然后倾尽所有，在一个更好的地区，花21000美元买下了一座房子。”</p>

<p>The move was only  three miles to the south, to a former apricot orchard in Los Altos that had  been turned into a subdivision of cookie-cutter tract homes. Their house, at  2066 Crist Drive, was one story with three bedrooms and an all-important  attached garage with a roll-down door facing the street. There Paul Jobs could  tinker with cars and his son with electronics.</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>这趟搬家仅仅是向南移了3英里，来到了南洛斯阿尔托斯（SouthLosAltos）一处由杏树果园改造成的毫无特色的居民区。他们的新家位于克莱斯特路2066号，是一栋平房，有三间卧室，以及一个面朝马路、带卷帘门、设施齐全的车库。在车库里，保罗·乔布斯可以修汽车，而他儿子可以玩他的电子设备。</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Its other significant  attribute was that it was just over the line inside what was then the  Cupertino-Sunnyvale School District, one of the safest and best in the valley.  “When I moved here, these corners were still orchards,” Jobs pointed out as we  walked in front of his old house. “The guy who lived right there taught me how  to be a good organic gardener and to compost. He grew everything to perfection.  I never had better food in my life. That’s when I began to appreciate organic  fruits and vegetables.”</p></div>
<div class="right">
<p>这栋房子的另一个意义重大之处就是它正好处在库比蒂诺-森尼韦尔学区内，这是硅谷最安全也是最好的学区之一。“我搬来这儿时，这些角落里都还是杏树，”我们走过他家的老屋前，乔布斯指给我看。“住在那里的那个家伙教我怎么做一名有机作物园丁，以及如何制作堆肥。他不管种植什么东西都要追求完美。我一生中再没吃过比那儿更好的食物了。也就是从那时候起，我喜欢上了有机水果和蔬菜。”</p>

<p>Even though they were  not fervent about their faith, Jobs’s parents wanted him to have a religious  upbringing, so they took him to the Lutheran church most Sundays. That came to  an end when he was thirteen. In July 1968 Life magazine published a shocking  cover showing a pair of starving children in Biafra. Jobs took it to Sunday  school and confronted the church’s pastor. “If I raise my finger, will God know  which one I’m going to raise even before I do it?”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>尽管乔布斯的父母对于宗教信仰并不是十分狂热，但他们还是希望自己的孩子能受一点儿宗教教育，所以大多数的星期天他们都会带他去路德教堂（theLutheranChurch）。这一活动在他13岁那年鐘束了。乔布斯一家订阅了《生活》杂志，1968年该杂志在封面上刊登了一张令人震惊的照片，照片上是比亚法拉的一对饥饿的儿童。乔布斯把杂志带到教堂，质问牧师：“如果我举起我的手指头，上帝在我举之前就知道我要举哪一根吗？”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The pastor answered,  “Yes, God knows everything.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>牧师回答说：“是的，上帝无所不知。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs then pulled out  the Life cover and asked, “Well, does God know about this and what’s going to  happen to those children?”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯于是拿出那期《生活》杂志的封面，问道：“那么，上帝知道这些吗？他知道这些孩子身上会发生什么事情吗？”</p>

<p>Jobs announced that he  didn’t want to have anything to do with worshipping such a God, and he never  went back to church. He did, however, spend years studying and trying to  practice the tenets of Zen Buddhism. Reflecting years later on his spiritual  feelings, he said that religion was at its best when it emphasized spiritual  experiences rather than received dogma. “The juice goes out of Christianity  when it becomes too based on faith rather than on living like Jesus or seeing  the world as Jesus saw it,” he told me. “I think different religions are  different doors to the same house. Sometimes I think the house exists, and  sometimes I don’t. It’s the great mystery.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯宣布，他再也不想崇敬这样一位上帝，他也再没有去过教堂。不过，他倒是花了好几年时间研究并尝试实践佛教禅宗的教义。几年后，他反思自己的精神感受时说，宗教应该更多地强调精神体验，而不是一味遵守教条。“当基督教太过基于信仰，而忽略了以耶稣的方式生活或者从耶稣的角度看世界时，它的精髓就消失了，”他告诉我，“我觉得不同的宗教就好比通往同一栋房子的不同的门。有时候我觉得这栋房子存在，有时候我又觉得它不存在。这是最神秘的。”</p>

<p>Paul Jobs was then  working at Spectra-Physics, a company in nearby Santa Clara that made lasers  for electronics and medical products. As a machinist, he crafted the prototypes  of products that the engineers were devising. His son was fascinated by the  need for perfection. “Lasers require precision alignment,” Jobs said. “The  really sophisticated ones, for airborne applications or medical, had very  precise features. They would tell my dad something like, ‘This is what we want,  and we want it out of one piece of metal so that the coefficients of expansion  are all the same.’ And he had to figure out how to do it.” Most pieces had to  be made from scratch, which meant that Paul had to create custom tools and  dies. His son was impressed, but he rarely went to the machine shop. “It would  have been fun if he had gotten to teach me how to use a mill and lathe. But  unfortunately I never went, because I was more interested in electronics.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯的父亲当时在光谱物理公司（Spectra-Kiysics）工作，该公司坐落在旁边的圣克拉拉，为电子设备和医疗产品生产激光器件。作为一名机械师，他为工程师们设计的产品制作样机。他的儿子被那种对完美的追求所深深吸引。“激光仪器要求极其精准的调校，”乔布斯说，“真正尖端的激光仪器，比如飞机上使用的或者用于医疗的，都非常精密。工程师们会对我爸爸说，‘这就是我们想要的，我们还想要用一整块金属板一体成型来保证膨胀系数的一致’然后爸爸就要想办法怎么实现。”大多数样机都是从零开始制作的，这就意味着保罗·乔布斯必须定制各种工具和模他的儿子被此深深吸引，却很少去车间看看。“要是他能教我用铣和车床的话，一定会很有意思的，但遗憾的是，我从没去过他的车间，因为我对电子的东西更感兴趣。”</p>

<p>One summer Paul took  Steve to Wisconsin to visit the family’s dairy farm. Rural life did not appeal  to Steve, but one image stuck with him. He saw a calf being born, and he was  amazed when the tiny animal struggled up within minutes and began to walk. “It  was not something she had learned, but it was instead hardwired into her,” he  recalled. “A human baby couldn’t do that. I found it remarkable, even though no  one else did.” He put it in hardware-software terms: “It was as if something in  the animal’s body and in its brain had been engineered to work together  instantly rather than being learned.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>一年夏天，保罗·乔布斯带着史蒂夫去威斯康星州参观他们家的奶牛场。乡村生活对史蒂夫毫无吸引力，但有一幅画面却深深刻在了他心上。他看到了一只小牛犊的出生，让他惊讶的是，这只小动物才落地几分钟就挣扎着站起来开始走路。“这不是它通过学习获得的技能，而是与生俱来的，”他回忆说，“人类的婴儿就没有这种能力。我觉得这很了不起，虽然别人都不这么想。”他用软硬件的术语来形容这个现象：“就好像是设计好的一样，动物身体里的某些东西和它大脑里的某些东西在它出生后立刻始协同作用，而不需要它去学习。”</p>

<p>In ninth grade Jobs  went to Homestead High, which had a sprawling campus of two-story cinderblock  buildings painted pink that served two thousand students. “It was designed by a  famous prison architect,” Jobs recalled. “They wanted to make it  indestructible.” He had developed a love of walking, and he walked the fifteen  blocks to school by himself each day.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>到了九年级，乔布斯去了家园髙中（HomesteadHigh）,这所学校的校园有些杂乱，由几栋两层楼的砖砌建筑构成，建筑都被刷成了粉色，当时有2000名学生。“学校是由一个著名的监狱建筑师设计的，”乔布斯回忆说，“他们想把学校建得坚不可摧。”乔布斯那时候爱上了走路，他每天都独自走过15条街去上学。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He had few friends his  own age, but he got to know some seniors who were immersed in the  counterculture of the late 1960s. It was a time when the geek and hippie worlds  were beginning to show some overlap. “My friends were the really smart kids,”  he said. “I was interested in math and science and electronics. They were too,  and also into LSD and the whole counterculture trip.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>他没什么同龄的朋友，却认识几个沉浸在20世纪60年代晚期反主流文化浪潮中的高年级学生。那时候，极客和嬉皮士的世界开始显现出一些重叠了。“我的朋友们都很聪明，”他说，“我对数学、科学和电子学感兴趣，他们也是，而且大家都喜欢迷幻药和反主流文化。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His pranks by then  typically involved electronics. At one point he wired his house with speakers.  But since speakers can also be used as microphones, he built a control room in  his closet, where he could listen in on what was happening in other rooms. One  night, when he had his headphones on and was listening in on his parents’  bedroom, his father caught him and angrily demanded that he dismantle the  system. He spent many evenings visiting the garage of Larry Lang, the engineer  who lived down the street from his old house. Lang eventually gave Jobs the  carbon microphone that had fascinated him, and he turned him on to Heathkits,  those assemble-it-yourself kits for making ham radios and other electronic gear  that were beloved by the soldering set back then. “Heathkits came with all the  boards and parts color-coded, but the manual also explained the theory of how  it operated,” Jobs recalled. “It made you realize you could build and  understand anything. Once you built a couple of radios, you’d see a TV in the  catalogue and say, ‘I can build that as well,’ even if you didn’t. I was very  lucky, because when I was a kid both my dad and the Heathkits made me believe I  could build anything.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>那时候，他的恶作剧一般都会用到电子设备。有一次，他在家中连接了几个扬声器。杨声器也可以用做麦克风，他在自己的衣柜里建了一个控制室，这样就可以偷听其他房间的声音了。有天晚上，他正戴着耳机偷听父母房间的声音，父亲逮到了他，愤怒地要求他拆除整套系统。很多晚上他都会造访他以前的工程师邻居拉里·朗的车库。朗最终把那只令乔布斯魂牵梦萦的碳精麦克风送给了他，还让他迷上了希斯工具盒（Heathkits）一一当时广受欢迎的用来制作无线电设备或其他电子装备，但需要自己组装的工具套装。“希斯工具盒里面有各种各样用不同颜色编号的插件板和零部件，还有解释其使用原理的操作手册。”乔布斯回忆，“它让你意识到你能组装并搞懂任何东西。你做完几个无线电装置后，就会在目录里看到电视机，你会说，这个我也能做，目卩便你并不会真的去做。我很幸运，因为当我还是个孩子的时候，我的父亲，还有希斯工具盒都让我相信，我能做出任何东西。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Lang also got him into  the Hewlett-Packard Explorers Club, a group of fifteen or so students who met  in the company cafeteria on Tuesday nights. “They would get an engineer from  one of the labs to come and talk about what he was working on,” Jobs recalled.  “My dad would drive me there. I was in heaven. HP was a pioneer of  light-emitting diodes. So we talked about what to do with them.” Because his  father now worked for a laser company, that topic particularly interested him.  One night he cornered one of HP’s laser engineers after a talk and got a tour  of the holography lab. But the most lasting impression came from seeing the  small computers the company was developing. “I saw my first desktop computer  there. It was called the 9100A,  and it was a glorified calculator but also really the first desktop computer.  It was huge, maybe forty pounds, but it was a beauty of a thing. I fell in love  with it.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>朗还让乔布斯加入了惠普探索者俱乐部，这是一个每周一次的聚会，每周二晚在公司餐厅进行，有大概15个学生参加。“他们会从实验室里请来一个工程师，给我们讲讲他正在研究的东西，”乔布斯回忆，“我爸爸会开车送我去。我感觉那儿就是我的天堂。惠普当时是发光二极管（LED）行业的先锋，所以我们就会讨论发光二极管的一些问题。”因为当时父亲为一家激光公司工作，所以乔布斯对发光二极管特别感兴趣。有一天晚上，聚会结束之后，他拦住了惠普的一名激光工程师，获得了参观他们全息摄影实验室的机会。但最让他印象深刻的还是见到了当时惠普正在开发的小型计算机。“我在那里第一次见到了台式计算机，它被称为9100A,是一台被神化了的计算器，但也确实是第一台台式计算机。它身形巨大，大概有40磅重，但它真的很美，我爱上了它。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The kids in the  Explorers Club were encouraged to do projects, and Jobs decided to build a  frequency counter, which measures the number of pulses per second in an  electronic signal. He needed some parts that HP made, so he picked up the phone  and called the CEO. “Back then, people didn’t have unlisted numbers. So I  looked up Bill Hewlett in Palo Alto and called him at home. And he answered and  chatted with me for twenty minutes. He got me the parts, but he also got me a  job in the plant where they made frequency counters.” Jobs worked there the  summer after his freshman year at Homestead High. “My dad would drive me in the  morning and pick me up in the evening.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>探索者俱乐部的孩子们被鼓励做一些项目，乔布斯决定做一台频率计数器，这是用来测量一个电子信号中每秒钟的脉冲数量的。他需要一些惠普制造的零件，所以他拿起电话打给了惠普的CEO：“那个时候，所有的电话号码都是登记在册的，所以我在电话簿上寻找住在帕洛奥图的比尔·休利特，然后打到了他家。他接了电话并和我聊了20分钟，之后他给了我那些零件，也给了我一份工作，就在他们制造频率计数器的工厂。”乔布斯髙中第一年的暑假就在那里工作。“我爸爸早上幵车送我去，晚上再把我接回家。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His work mainly  consisted of “just putting nuts and bolts on things” on an assembly line. There  was some resentment among his fellow line workers toward the pushy kid who had  talked his way in by calling the CEO. “I remember telling one of the supervisors,  ‘I love this stuff, I love this stuff,’ and then I asked him what he liked to  do best. And he said, ‘To fuck, to fuck.’” Jobs had an easier time ingratiating  himself with the engineers who worked one floor above. “They served doughnuts  and coffee every morning at ten. So I’d go upstairs and hang out with them.”</p></div>
<div class="right">


<p>他的工作主要就是在一条流水线上“安装基本元件”。一部分工友对这个爱出风头的孩子有些不满，因为他是通过给CEO打电话才得到了这份工作的。“我记得我告诉一个监督员：‘我喜欢这玩意儿，我喜欢这玩意儿。’然后我问他最喜欢做什么，他回答说：‘我喜欢鬼混，我喜欢鬼混。’”乔布斯与在楼上工作的工程师们相处甚欢。“每天早上10点，他们15儿都会供应甜甜圈和咖啡。我会跑上楼跟他们混在一起。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs liked to work. He  also had a newspaper route—his father would drive him when it was raining—and  during his sophomore year spent weekends and the summer as a stock clerk at a  cavernous electronics store, Haltek. It was to electronics what his father’s  junkyards were to auto parts: a scavenger’s paradise sprawling over an entire  city block with new, used, salvaged, and surplus components crammed onto  warrens of shelves, dumped unsorted into bins, and piled in an outdoor yard.  “Out in the back, near the bay, they had a fenced-in area with things like  Polaris submarine interiors that had been ripped and sold for salvage,” he  recalled. “All the controls and buttons were right there. The colors were  military greens and grays, but they had these switches and bulb covers of amber  and red. There were these big old lever switches that, when you flipped them,  it was awesome, like you were blowing up Chicago.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯喜欢工作。他曾经送过报纸——下雨的时候父亲会开丰送他——在他高中第二年的时候，周末和暑假他都在一家巨大的电子器材商店哈尔泰克（Haltek）做仓库管理员。如同他父亲那个堆满汽车零件的废品站一样，这家到处都是电子设备的商店也是拾荒者的天堂。这家商店延伸了一整个街区，那些新的、旧的、回收的、过剩的部件塞满了架子，未经分类就扔进了箱子，还有的就堆在户外的院子里。“在仓库后面靠近海湾的地方，他们用栅栏围起了一块区域，里面放着北极星潜艇的内部元件，都是从潜艇上扒下来当做废品卖掉的，”他回忆说，“所有的操纵装置和按钮都在。它们都是军绿色或灰色的，但是开关和螺栓盖是琥珀色和红色的。那些开关都是老式的大型的手柄式开关，当你打开开关的时候，那种感觉太棒了，就好像你要炸了芝加哥一样。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>At the wooden counters  up front, laden with thick catalogues in tattered binders, people would haggle  for switches, resistors, capacitors, and sometimes the latest memory chips. His  father used to do that for auto parts, and he succeeded because he knew the  value of each better than the clerks. Jobs followed suit. He developed a  knowledge of electronic parts that was honed by his love of negotiating and  turning a profit. He would go to electronic flea markets, such as the San Jose  swap meet, haggle for a used circuit board that contained some valuable chips  or components, and then sell those to his manager at Haltek.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>在店里堆满了厚厚目录的木制柜台前，人们会为了开关、电阻、电容和最新的存储芯片讨价还价。乔布斯的父亲以前也曾为汽车部件做过这样的事情，因为他比店员还清楚零件的价格，所以每次都能还价成功。乔布斯在这点上学习了父亲。他热衷于谈判并中获得实惠，这也让他对电子零件有了更充分的了解。他会去电子产品的跳蚤市场，比如圣何塞交换大会，为了一块带有值钱芯片的电路板跟人讨价还价，然后把那些芯片卖给哈尔泰克商店的经理。</p>

<div class="layout">

<p>Jobs was able to get  his first car, with his father’s help, when he was fifteen. It was a two-tone  Nash Metropolitan that his father had fitted out with an MG engine. Jobs didn’t  really like it, but he did not want to tell his father that, or miss out on the  chance to have his own car. “In retrospect, a Nash Metropolitan might seem like  the most wickedly cool car,” he later said. “But at the time it was the most  uncool car in the world. Still, it was a car, so that was great.” Within a year  he had saved up enough from his various jobs that he could trade up to a red  Fiat 850 coupe with an Abarth engine. “My dad helped me buy and inspect it. The  satisfaction of getting paid and saving up for something, that was very  exciting.”</p></div>
<div class="right">



<p>15岁那年，在父亲的帮助下，乔布斯拥有了自己的第一辆汽车。那是一辆双拼色的纳什大都会轿车（Nash Metropolitan），他父亲为之配备了一台英国MG公司生产的发动机。乔布斯并不怎么喜欢这辆车，但他不想让父亲知道，更不想错过拥有自己汽车的机会。“现在回想起来，纳什大都会看起来是最酷的车了，”他后来说，“但当时它是全世界最烂的车。不过，不管怎么样它也是一辆车，这就很好了。”不到一年，他通过各种各样的工作攒够了钱，可以换一辆带阿巴斯（Abarth）发动机的红色菲亚特850轿跑车了。“我爸爸帮我买车并检査了车况。把挣的钱攒起来去买东西的那种满足感太让人兴奋了。”</p>

</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That same summer,  between his sophomore and junior years at Homestead, Jobs began smoking  marijuana. “I got stoned for the first time that summer. I was fifteen, and  then began using pot regularly.” At one point his father found some dope in his  son’s Fiat. “What’s this?” he asked. Jobs coolly replied, “That’s marijuana.”  It was one of the few times in his life that he faced his father’s anger. “That  was the only real fight I ever got in with my dad,” he said. But his father  again bent to his will. “He wanted me to promise that I’d never use pot again,  but I wouldn’t promise.” In fact by his senior year he was also dabbling in LSD  and hash as well as exploring the mind-bending effects of sleep deprivation. “I  was starting to get stoned a bit more. We would also drop acid occasionally,  usually in fields or in cars.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>也是在那一年夏天，在他结束髙二即将升入高三的时候，乔布斯开始抽大麻。“那年夏天我第一次抽大麻，当时我15岁，之后就经常抽了。”有一次他父亲在他的菲亚特车上发现了一些大麻。“这是什么？”他问。乔布斯平静地回答说：“大麻。”这是他一生中为数不多的一次直面父亲的愤怒。“那是我唯一一次真的和爸爸发生争执。”他说。但他父亲又一次屈从于他的意愿。“他要我保证以后再也不抽大麻了，但我不愿意保证。”实际上，到了高中第四年，他已经同时使用迷幻药和大麻了，并且还在探索睡眠剥夺的致幻效果。“我开始加大吸食大麻的剂量。我们偶尔也会用迷幻药，通常是在旷野中或是在车里。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He also flowered  intellectually during his last two years in high school and found himself at  the intersection, as he had begun to see it, of those who were geekily immersed  in electronics and those who were into literature and creative endeavors. “I  started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of  just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear.” His other  favorites included Moby-Dick and the poems of Dylan Thomas. I asked him why he  related to King Lear and Captain Ahab, two of the most willful and driven  characters in literature, but he didn’t respond to the connection I was making,  so I let it drop. “When I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class.  The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of  us snowshoeing in Yosemite.”</p></div>

<p>髙中的最后两年，乔布斯的心智也快速发展，他发现自己既沉浸在极客的电子世界中，又喜欢文学和创造性的尝试。“我开始听很多音乐，阅读科技以外的书，例如莎士比亚、柏拉图的作品。我爱看《李尔王》。”他最爱的还包括《白鲸》和迪兰·托马斯（DylanThomas）的诗作。我问他为什么喜欢李尔王和阿哈船长，这两个是文学作品中最固执、最执著的角色，但他没有回答我，我也没有再提。“我髙中第四年的时候上的大学英语预修课非常棒，老师是个长得很像欧内斯特·海明威的人。他会带我们一大帮人去优山美地国家公园（Yosemite）踏雪。”</p>

<p>One course that Jobs  took would become part of Silicon Valley lore: the electronics class taught by  John McCollum, a former Navy pilot who had a showman’s flair for exciting his  students with such tricks as firing up a Tesla coil. His little stockroom, to  which he would lend the key to pet students, was crammed with transistors and  other components he had scored.</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯听的一门课日后成为了硅谷传奇的一部分，这就是约翰·麦科勒姆（JohnMcCollum）教授的电子学。约翰以前是海军飞行员，他像个杂耍艺人般，通过各种小把戏来激起学生的兴趣，比如让特斯拉线圈产生电火花。他会把自己储藏室的钥匙借给他宠爱的学生，这个小储藏室堆满了晶体管之类的零部件。他有一种奇普先生（Mr.Chips）般的魔力，可以给学生解释清楚电子学原理，并把原理联系到实际应用中，例如怎样将电阻和电容串联和并联，然后用这些知识来制作放大器或者无线电设备。</p>

<p>McCollum’s classroom  was in a shed-like building on the edge of the campus, next to the parking lot.  “This is where it was,” Jobs recalled as he peered in the window, “and here,  next door, is where the auto shop class used to be.” The juxtaposition  highlighted the shift from the interests of his father’s generation. “Mr.  McCollum felt that electronics class was the new auto shop.”</p></div>
<div class="right">

<p>麦科勒姆的教室在校园边缘一座厂房模样的建筑里，紧邻着停车场。“就在这儿，”乔布斯凝视着教室的窗户说，“隔壁就是以前的汽车修理课教室。”这样一种空间上的并列关系也突出了他们这一代与父辈那一代在兴趣上发生的转变。“麦科勒姆先生觉得电子学就是新的汽车维修。”</p>

<p>McCollum believed in  military discipline and respect for authority. Jobs didn’t. His aversion to  authority was something he no longer tried to hide, and he affected an attitude  that combined wiry and weird intensity with aloof rebelliousness. McCollum  later said, “He was usually off in a corner doing something on his own and  really didn’t want to have much of anything to do with either me or the rest of  the class.” He never trusted Jobs with a key to the stockroom. One day Jobs  needed a part that was not available, so he made a collect call to the  manufacturer, Burroughs in Detroit, and said he was designing a new product and  wanted to test out the part. It arrived by air freight a few days later. When  McCollum asked how he had gotten it, Jobs described—with defiant pride—the  collect call and the tale he had told. “I was furious,” McCollum said. “That  was not the way I wanted my students to behave.” Jobs’s response was, “I don’t  have the money for the phone call. They’ve got plenty of money.”</p></div>

<p>麦科勒姆信奉军事化的戒律以及对杈威的尊重，乔布斯则不然。他已经不再隐藏自己对权威的厌恶，他的态度结合了怪异而顽固的激情和超然的叛逆。“他经常一个人在角落里做自己的事情，压根不想跟我或者班上的其他人有任何交流。”麦科勒姆后来说。他从来没有放心地把储藏室的钥匙给过乔布斯。有一次乔布斯需要一样市面上找不到的零件，他就给制造商——底特律的伯勒斯公司（Burroughs）——打了一个对方付费电话，告诉他们自己正在设计一个新产品，想要测试一下那个部件。几天之后，这个部件通过航空包裹寄到了乔布斯手上。当麦科勒姆问他从哪儿弄来的时候，乔布斯带着一种旁若无人的骄傲讲述了事情的经过——他是怎样打对方付费电话并且编故事的。“我很愤怒，”麦科勒姆说，“我不希望我的学生做这样的事情。”乔布斯的反应则是：“我没钱打电话，而那家公司很有钱。”</p>

<p>Jobs took McCollum’s  class for only one year, rather than the three that it was offered. For one of  his projects, he made a device with a photocell that would switch on a circuit  when exposed to light, something any high school science student could have  done. He was far more interested in playing with lasers, something he learned  from his father. With a few friends, he created light shows for parties by  bouncing lasers off mirrors that were attached to the speakers of his stereo  system.</p>

  <div class="right">  <p>麦科勒姆的课程是三年，但乔布斯只上了一年。在一个项目中，他制造了一台带有光感器的装置，光感器遇到光后就会开启电路。任何一个学过科学课的高中生都能做出这样的装置。他更感兴趣的是硏究激光——他从父亲那儿学到的东西。乔布斯和几个朋友一起，通过使用安装在扬声器上的镜面反射激光，实现了用于各种派对的音乐灯光表演。</div></div>
