        <strong>FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE BESTSELLING BIOGRAPHIES OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND  ALBERT EINSTEIN, THIS IS THE EXCLUSIVE BIOGRAPHY OF STEVE JOBS.</strong></p>
    <p>Based on more than  forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years—as well as interviews with  more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and  colleagues—Walter Isaacson has written a <a href="#" title="美 ['rɪvɪtɪŋ]
英 ['rɪvɪtɪŋ]
    adj.吸引人的；引人入胜的">riveting</a> story of the roller-coaster  life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion  for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal  computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital  publishing.</p>

<p>At a time when America  is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate  icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to  create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with  technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined  with remarkable feats of engineering.</p>

<p>Although Jobs  cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor  even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing <a href="#" title="adj.不准进入的；禁止入内的；不许谈论的；禁止探讨的
n.禁止入内(地区)">offlimits</a>. He  encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly,  sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against.  His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions,  perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, <a href="#" title="英 ['dev(ə)lri]
    n.恶劣行为；妖术；恶作剧；胡作非为">devilry</a>, and compulsion for control that  shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.</p>

<p>Driven by demons, Jobs  could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and  products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be,  as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary,  filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.<br />
