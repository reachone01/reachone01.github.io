<h3>Chrisann Brennan</h3>

<p>Toward the end of his  senior year at Homestead, in the spring of 1972, Jobs started going out with a  girl named Chrisann Brennan, who was about his age but still a junior. With her  light brown hair, green eyes, high cheekbones, and fragile aura, she was very  attractive. She was also enduring the breakup of her parents’ marriage, which  made her vulnerable. “We worked together on an animated movie, then started  going out, and she became my first real girlfriend,” Jobs recalled. As Brennan  later said, “Steve was kind of crazy. That’s why I was attracted to him.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>克里斯安·布伦南</h3>


<p>1972年春天,乔布斯高中即将毕业时，开始与一位叫做克里斯安·布伦南的女孩儿交往。这个嬉皮士风格的女孩超凡脱俗，品与乔布斯同龄，但比他低一年级。她有一头浅褐色的秀发，绿眼睛，高颧骨，有些柔弱，十分迷人。她承受着父母婚姻破裂带来的痛苦，变得十分脆弱。“我们一起制作一部动画片，然后开始交往，她成了我第一任正式女友。”乔布斯回忆说。布伦南后来说：“史蒂夫很疯狂，这也正是他吸引我的地方。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s craziness was  of the cultivated sort. He had begun his lifelong experiments with compulsive  diets, eating only fruits and vegetables, so he was as lean and tight as a  whippet. He learned to stare at people without blinking, and he perfected long  silences punctuated by <a href="#" title="美 [-toʊ]
英 [stə'kɑ:təʊ]
    adj.断音的；断奏的；发不连贯爆发性声音的；短促刺耳的
    n.断奏；断续的一段音乐；不连贯的东西(如说话,发动机的声音等)
    adv.断奏地
    网络思加图；断弓；断奏的节奏">staccato</a> bursts of fast talking. This odd mix of  intensity and aloofness, combined with his shoulder-length hair and scraggly  beard, gave him the aura of a crazed shaman. He oscillated between charismatic  and creepy. “He shuffled around and looked half-mad,” recalled Brennan. “He had  a lot of angst. It was like a big darkness around him.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯的疯狂是以一种有教养的方式体现的。他开始了伴随他一生的强制性饮食实践——仅仅食用水果和蔬菜——所以他又瘦又结实，就像惠比特犬一样。他学会了眼睛一眨不眨地盯着别人，他喜欢在长时间的沉默中断断续续地加入语速极快的讲话。这样一种激情和冷漠的奇怪组合，再加上他那一头及肩长发和稀疏的胡茬儿，让他看上去就像个疯癫的萨满巫师。他时而展现超凡魅力，时而让人毛骨悚然。“他不断变化形象，看起来有点儿半疯，”布伦南回忆说，“他经常焦虑不安，好像有无尽的黑暗包围着他。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs had begun to drop  acid by then, and he turned Brennan on to it as well, in a wheat field just  outside Sunnyvale. “It was great,” he recalled. “I had been listening to a lot  of Bach. All of a sudden the wheat field was playing Bach. It was the most  wonderful feeling of my life up to that point. I felt like the conductor of  this symphony with Bach coming through the wheat.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>
乔布斯当时已经开始服用迷幻药了，在森尼韦尔郊外的一处麦田里，他让布伦南也加入了其中。“感觉很好，”他回忆说，“那段时间我听了很多巴赫的音乐。就在一瞬间，整个麦田似乎都在演奏巴赫。那是我到那时为止人生中最美妙的感触。我觉得自己就是交响乐的指挥，巴赫也好像出现在了麦田里。”
</p>
</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That summer of 1972,  after his graduation, he and Brennan moved to a cabin in the hills above Los  Altos. “I’m going to go live in a cabin with Chrisann,” he announced to his  parents one day. His father was furious. “No you’re not,” he said. “Over my  dead body.” They had recently fought about marijuana, and once again the  younger Jobs was willful. He just said good-bye and walked out.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>1972年夏天，乔布斯毕业之后，他和布伦南搬到了洛斯阿尔托斯一座山上的小屋里。“我要去小屋里和克里斯安同居了。”有一天他如此向父母宣告。他父亲怒不可遏。“不准去，”他说，“除非我死了。”他们最近刚刚因为大麻的事情争吵过，但这一次小乔布斯还是非常顽固。他说了声再见就走出了家门。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Brennan spent a lot of  her time that summer painting; she was talented, and she did a picture of a  clown for Jobs that he kept on the wall. Jobs wrote poetry and played guitar.  He could be brutally cold and rude to her at times, but he was also entrancing  and able to impose his will. “He was an enlightened being who was cruel,” she  recalled. “That’s a strange combination.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>那年夏天，布伦南用了很多时间画画。她非常有才华，画了一幅小丑的画送给乔布斯，他一直把它挂在墙上。乔布斯平时就写写诗，玩玩吉他。他有时候会对布伦南非常冷血和粗鲁，但有时候又十分迷人，可以轻易说服别人接受自己的意愿。“他很开明，又很残酷，”她回忆说，“真是奇怪的组合。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Midway through the  summer, Jobs was almost killed when his red Fiat caught fire. He was driving on  Skyline Boulevard in the Santa Cruz Mountains with a high school friend, Tim  Brown, who looked back, saw flames coming from the engine, and casually said to  Jobs, “Pull over, your car is on fire.” Jobs did. His father, despite their  arguments, drove out to the hills to tow the Fiat home.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>暑假中间，有一次乔布斯的红色菲亚特着火了，他差点儿因此丧命。当时他正行驶在圣克鲁兹山区的天际线大道上，与他同行的是一个高中朋友，蒂姆·布朗（TimBrown）。蒂姆朝后看了一眼，发现引擎在往外冒火花，于是他平静地对乔布斯说：“靠边停车，你的车着火了。”乔布斯照做了。他父亲尽管与他发生了争执，还是驱车来到山区，把菲亚特拖回了家。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In order to find a way  to make money for a new car, Jobs got Wozniak to drive him to De Anza College  to look on the help-wanted bulletin board. They discovered that the Westgate  Shopping Center in San Jose was seeking college students who could dress up in  costumes and amuse the kids. So for $3 an hour, Jobs, Wozniak, and Brennan  donned heavy full-body costumes and headgear to play Alice in Wonderland, the  Mad Hatter, and the White Rabbit. Wozniak, in his earnest and sweet way, found  it fun. “I said, ‘I want to do it, it’s my chance, because I love children.’ I  think Steve looked at it as a <a href="#" title="美 ['laʊzi]
英 ['laʊzi]
    adj.非常糟的；极坏的；恶劣的
    网络差劲；糟糕的；差劲的">lousy</a> job, but I looked at it as a fun  adventure.” Jobs did indeed find it a pain. “It was hot, the costumes were  heavy, and after a while I felt like I wanted to smack some of the kids.”  Patience was never one of his virtues. </p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>为了想办法赚钱买一辆新车，乔布斯让沃兹尼亚克开车带他去了迪安扎学院，到那里的公告板上寻找招工启事。他们发现，圣何塞的西门购物中心（WestgateShoppingCenter）正在招募大学生，要他们穿上戏服逗小孩子玩。为了3美元一小时的报酬，乔布斯和沃兹尼亚克以及布伦南穿上厚厚的全套戏服，戴上帽子，扮演梦游仙境的爱丽丝、疯帽子和白兔子。真诚又亲切的沃兹尼亚克，觉得这一切十分有趣。“我说：‘我想做这个，这是我的机会，因为我喜欢小孩子。’我从惠普请了假。我想史蒂夫觉得这是个烂工作，但我把它当做一次愉快的经历。”乔布斯确实做得很痛苦：“太热了，那些服装又很重，只要在里面待上一会儿我就会产生揍那些小孩儿的冲动。”“耐心”这个词，从来就与乔布斯沽不上边儿。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<h3><a name="s2" id="s2"></a>Reed College </h3>

<p>Seventeen years  earlier, Jobs’s parents had made a pledge when they adopted him: He would go to  college. So they had worked hard and saved dutifully for his college fund,  which was modest but adequate by the time he graduated. But Jobs, becoming ever  more willful, did not make it easy. At first he toyed with not going to college  at all. “I think I might have headed to New York if I didn’t go to college,” he  recalled, musing on how different his world—and perhaps all of ours—might have  been if he had chosen that path. When his parents pushed him to go to college,  he responded in a passive-aggressive way. He did not consider state schools,  such as Berkeley, where Woz then was, despite the fact that they were more  affordable. Nor did he look at Stanford, just up the road and likely to offer a  scholarship. “The kids who went to Stanford, they already knew what they wanted  to do,” he said. “They weren’t really artistic. I wanted something that was  more artistic and interesting.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>里德学院</h3>

<p>17年前，乔布斯的父母领养他的时候曾经作过保证：他一定会上大学。所以他们一直努力工作，为他的大学专款省吃俭用，等到乔布斯高中毕业时，这笔专款虽不多，但也足够他上大学的费用了。但越来越任性的乔布斯把这件事变得很艰难。一开始，他根本就不想读大学。“如果我没有读大学的话，我应该会直接去纽约。”他回忆说，一边思考着如果当年选择了那条道路，自己的世界——也许是我们所有人的世界——会有怎样的不同。当他的父母坚持要他上大学时，他以一种被动而富有侵略性的态度进行了回应。他不考虑州立学，比如当时沃兹就读的伯克利，尽管州立大学的学费更加亲民。他也不想去斯坦福，尽管就在家旁边，而且可能会给他提供奖学金。“去念斯坦福的人，他们已经知道自己想要什么了，”他说，“他们一点儿艺术性都没有。我想要上的是更富有艺术性的、更有趣的学校。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Instead he insisted on  applying only to Reed College, a private liberal arts school in Portland,  Oregon, that was one of the most expensive in the nation. He was visiting Woz  at Berkeley when his father called to say an acceptance letter had arrived from  Reed, and he tried to talk Steve out of going there. So did his mother. It was  far more than they could afford, they said. But their son responded with an  ultimatum: If he couldn’t go to Reed, he wouldn’t go anywhere. They relented,  as usual.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>他坚持唯一的一个选项是里德学院，位于俄勒閃州波特兰市的一所私立文理学院，也是全美最贵的大学之一。他在伯克利看望沃兹的时候接到了父亲的电话，被告知里德学院的录取通知书到了，同时父亲还试图劝说史蒂夫不要去那里，母亲也劝他。他们说，里德的学费太高了，根本不是他们所能承受的。但他们的儿子下了最后通牒：如果他不能去里德学院的话，那么他就哪儿都不去。如往常一样，父母又一次妥协了。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Reed had only one  thousand students, half the number at Homestead High. It was known for its  free-spirited hippie lifestyle, which combined somewhat uneasily with its  rigorous academic standards and core curriculum. Five years earlier Timothy  Leary, the guru of psychedelic enlightenment, had sat cross-legged at the Reed  College commons while on his League for Spiritual Discovery (LSD) college tour,  during which he exhorted his listeners, “Like every great religion of the past  we seek to find the divinity within. . . . These ancient goals we define in the  metaphor of the present—turn on, tune in, drop out.” Many of Reed’s students  took all three of those injunctions seriously; the dropout rate during the  1970s was more than one-third.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>里德的在校生只有1000人，规模只有家园高中的一半。学校以自由精神及嬉皮士生活方式著称，与这样一种生活方式并存的是学校严格的学术准及核心课程。5年前，迷幻启蒙运动的领袖蒂莫西·利里（TimothyLeary）在他的“精神探索联盟”高校之旅中，曾经盘腿坐在里德学院的草地上，大声呼喊：“就如同过去所有我们在其中寻找神性的伟大宗教一样……那些古老的目标都隐喻着现在——打开心扉、自问心源、脱离尘世（Turnon,tunein,dropout）。”许多里德学院的学生把这三条吿诫奉为座右铭，学校在20世纪70年代的退学率超过了1/3。</p>

<p>When it came time for  Jobs to <a href="#" title="美 [mə'trɪkjə.leɪt]
英 [mə'trɪkjʊleɪt]
    v.（正式）被大学录取；注册入大学；（从学校）毕业
    n.被许入学者">matriculate</a> in the fall of 1972, his parents drove him up to Portland,  but in another small act of rebellion he refused to let them come on campus. In  fact he refrained from even saying good-bye or thanks. He recounted the moment  later with uncharacteristic regret:</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>1972年，乔布斯要开学了，他的父母开车带他来到了波特兰。但他又做出了叛逆的举动：拒绝父母送他进校园。事实上，他甚至连“再见”和“谢谢”都没有说。后来他回想这件事的时候，充满了愧疚：</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It’s one of the things  in life I really feel ashamed about. I was not very sensitive, and I hurt their  feelings. I shouldn’t have. They had done so much to make sure I could go  there, but I just didn’t want them around. I didn’t want anyone to know I had  parents. I wanted to be like an orphan who had bummed around the country on  trains and just arrived out of nowhere, with no roots, no connections, no  background. </p>




<p>In late 1972, there  was a fundamental shift happening in American campus life. The nation’s  involvement in the Vietnam War, and the draft that accompanied it, was winding  down. Political activism at colleges receded and in many late-night dorm  conversations was replaced by an interest in pathways to personal fulfillment.  Jobs found himself deeply influenced by a variety of books on spirituality and  enlightenment, most notably Be Here Now, a guide to meditation and the wonders  of psychedelic drugs by Baba Ram Dass, born Richard Alpert. “It was profound,”  Jobs said. “It transformed me and many of my friends.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这是一生中真正让我觉得羞愧的一件事。我当时不够体贴，伤害了他们的感情。我不该那么做的。他们为了能让我去那儿读书竭尽全力，但我就是不愿意他们在我身边。我不想让任何人知道我有父母。我就想像个搭火车四处流浪的孤儿一样，突然出现在校园，没有根，没有与外界的联系，也没有背景故事。</p>

<p>1972年下半年，乔布斯来到里德学院的时候，美国的校园生活发生了根本性的转变。美国对越南的战争，以及随之而来的征兵热潮，都在逐渐平息。校园中的政治激进主义渐渐消退，许多宿舍的卧谈会主题都已换成对自我实现的兴趣。乔布斯深受一系列关于精神和启蒙的书籍影响，尤其是《此时此地》（BeHereNow），这是一本介绍冥想及致幻剂的美妙之处的书，作者是拉姆·达斯导师（BabaRamDass），本名叫理查德·阿尔拍特（RichardAlpert）。“这本书意义深远，”乔布斯说，“它改造了我和很多朋友。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The closest of those  friends was another wispy-bearded freshman named Daniel Kottke, who met Jobs a  week after they arrived at Reed and shared his interest in Zen, Dylan, and  acid. Kottke, from a wealthy New York suburb, was smart but low-<a href="#" title="美 ['ɑk.teɪn]

    v.避免
    网络避开；戒绝；躲避">eschew</a> material possessions, but he was  nonetheless impressed by Jobs’s tape deck. “Steve had a TEAC reel-to-reel and  massive quantities of Dylan bootlegs,” Kottke recalled. “He was both really  cool and high-tech.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这帮朋友里和乔布斯最亲密的是一个留着稀疏胡子的大一新生：丹尼尔·科特基（DanielKottke），他是在抵达里德学院一周后见到乔布斯的，和乔布斯一样喜欢佛教禅宗、迪伦和迷幻药。来自纽约一个富人区的科特基聪明又温和，对佛教的兴趣让他那花童一般的行为举止显得更加柔和。精神上的探索让他不再追求物质享受，尽管如此，他还是对乔布斯的录音座印象深刻。“史蒂夫有一台TEAC牌双卷盘录音设备，还有大量迪伦的录音带，”科特基回忆说，“他真的很酷，又科技感十足。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs started spending  much of his time with Kottke and his girlfriend, Elizabeth Holmes, even after  he insulted her at their first meeting by grilling her about how much money it  would take to get her to have sex with another man. They hitchhiked to the  coast together, engaged in the typical dorm raps about the meaning of life,  attended the love festivals at the local Hare Krishna temple, and went to the  Zen center for free vegetarian meals. “It was a lot of fun,” said Kottke, “but  also philosophical, and we took Zen very seriously.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯开始经常和科特基及他的女友伊丽莎白·霍姆斯（ElizabethHolmes）混在一起，尽管第一次见面时他就羞辱了伊丽莎白，他不停追问要多少钱才能让她跟另一个男人上床。他们会一起搭便车去海边玩，参加宿舍里关于生命意义的说唱，去当地的哈雷·克里希纳寺庙参加爱心活动（lovefestivals），还会去禅宗中心吃免费的素食。“这些很有意思，”科特基说，“也极具哲学层面的意义，对于禅宗我们是非常严肃的。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs began sharing  with Kottke other books, including Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind by Shunryu Suzuki,  Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda, and <a href="#" title="    v.洞穿
    网络穿过；直通式；穿透">Cutting Through</a> Spiritual  Materialism by Chogyam Trungpa. They created a meditation room in the attic  <a href="#" title="v.爬；爬行；匍匐行进；（昆虫）爬行

</div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯开始去图书馆，并跟科特基分享其他关于禅宗的书，包括铃木俊隆（ShunryuSuzuki）的《禅者的初心》（ZenMind,Beginner-sMind）,帕拉宏撒·尤迦南达（ParamahansaYogananda）的《一个瑜伽行者的自传》（AutobiographyofaYogi），理查德·莫里斯·比克（RichardMauriceBucke）的《宇宙的意识》（CosmicConsciousness）,以及丘扬创巴（ChGgyamTrungpa）的《突破精神唯物主义》（CuttingThroughSpiritualMaterialism）。他们在霍姆斯房间屋顶阁楼的狭小空间里开辟了一间冥想室，在里面布置了印度花布、一块手纺纱棉毯、蜡烛、熏香还有冥想坐垫。“天花板上有一扇小门，是通向阁楼的，那里空间很大，”他说，“我们有时候在那里服用迷幻药，但大多数时候我们只是在里面冥想而已。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s engagement with  Eastern spirituality, and especially Zen Buddhism, was not just some passing  fancy or youthful dabbling. He embraced it with his typical intensity, and it  became deeply ingrained in his personality. “Steve is very much Zen,” said  Kottke. “It was a deep influence. You see it in his whole approach of <a href="#" title="adv.赤裸；一丝不挂
adj.了无修饰的；荒凉的；粗陋的；严酷的">stark</a>,  minimalist aesthetics, intense focus.” Jobs also became deeply influenced by  the emphasis that Buddhism places on intuition. “I began to realize that an  intuitive understanding and consciousness was more significant than abstract  thinking and intellectual logical analysis,” he later said. His intensity,  however, made it difficult for him to achieve inner peace; his Zen awareness  was not accompanied by an excess of calm, peace of mind, or interpersonal  mellowness.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯对东方精神，尤其是佛教禅宗的信奉，并不是心血来潮或年轻人的一时冲动。他投入了他特有的那种激情，这些东西也在他的性格中根深蒂固。“史蒂夫是个十足的禅宗信徒，”科特基说，“禅宗对他的影响非常深。这一点你可以从他极简主义的美学观点和执著的个性上看出来。”佛教对直觉的强调也深深影响了乔布斯。“我开始意识到，基于直觉的理解和意识，比抽象思维和逻辑分析更为重要。”他后来说。然而，他的激情让他很难实现真正的涅槃；内在的平静、内心的平和或者说为人的圆润这些禅修者的特质，并未在他身上有所显现。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He and Kottke enjoyed  playing a nineteenth-century German variant of chess called Kriegspiel, in  which the players sit back-to-back; each has his own board and pieces and  cannot see those of his opponent. A moderator informs them if a move they want  to make is legal or illegal, and they have to try to figure out where their  opponent’s pieces are. “The wildest game I played with them was during a  <a href="#" title="n.大量；（作为惩罚的）鞭打；笞刑；捆绑用的绳索">lashing</a> rainstorm sitting by the fireside,” recalled Holmes, who served as  moderator. “They were tripping on acid. They were moving so fast I could barely  keep up with them.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>他和科特基还喜欢玩一种源于19世纪德国的变种象棋——克里斯皮尔棋（Kriegspiel）,游戏中两名玩家背靠背坐着，每个人都有自己的棋盘和棋子，但无法看到对手的情况。旁边会有一名仲裁员告知他们走的每一步棋是否违反规则，他们则必须想办法弄清楚对手的棋子分布情况。“最疯狂的一盘棋，是有一次下暴雨的时候，他们俩坐在壁炉旁，”当时作为仲裁员的霍姆斯回忆说，“他们两个服了迷幻药后开始下棋，下得非常快，我几乎都跟不上他们。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Another book that  deeply influenced Jobs during his freshman year was Diet for a Small <a href="#" title="planet

    网络星球；普莱德；地球的小行星">Planet</a> by  Frances Moore Lappé, which extolled the personal and planetary benefits of  vegetarianism. “That’s when I swore off meat pretty much for good,” he  recalled. But the book also reinforced his tendency to embrace extreme diets,  which included purges, fasts, or eating only one or two foods, such as carrots  or apples, for weeks on end.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>还有一本书在乔布斯大一那年深深影响了他——也许影晌得有点儿过分——就是《一座小行星的新饮食方式》（DietforaSmallPlaneth）作者是弗朗西丝·摩尔·拉佩（FrancesMooreLappé），书中颂扬了素食主义对个人以及对我们整个星球的益处。“我就是那时候发誓不再吃肉的，为了自己也为了地球。”乔布斯回忆道。但这本书也进一步将他推向了极端的饮食习惯，包括催吐、禁食，或者连续几个星期都只吃固定的一两样食物，比如胡萝卜或苹果。</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs and Kottke became  serious vegetarians during their freshman year. “Steve got into it even more  than I did,” said Kottke. “He was <a href="#" title="    na.住在…之外；以…为生

There is a story about Steve turning orange from  eating so many carrots, and there is some truth to that.” Friends remember him  having, at times, a sunset-like orange hue.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯和科特基在大一这年成为了严格的素食主义者。“史蒂夫比我还深陷其中，”科特基说，“他完全靠吃麦片生存。”他们会去一个农民合作社买东西，乔布斯会买一盒麦片，吃上一个星期，再买点儿散装的健康食品。“他会买一些椰枣和杏仁，还有许多胡萝卜，他有一台冠军牌榨汁机，我们会做胡萝卜汁和胡萝卜沙拉。曾经有个故事说史蒂夫吃了太多的胡萝卜，皮肤都变成橘黄色了，这个故事可不完全是瞎编的。”朋友们都记得，史蒂夫的皮肤有时候会呈现出一种日落时分太阳般的橘黄色。</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs’s dietary habits  became even more obsessive when he read Mucusless Diet Healing System by Arnold  Ehret, an early twentieth-century German-born nutrition fanatic. He believed in  eating nothing but fruits and starchless vegetables, which he said prevented  the body from forming harmful mucus, and he advocated cleansing the body  regularly through prolonged fasts. That meant the end of even Roman Meal  cereal—or any bread, grains, or milk. Jobs began warning friends of the mucus  dangers lurking in their bagels. “I got into it in my typical nutso way,” he  said. At one point he and Kottke went for an entire week eating only apples,  and then Jobs began to try even purer fasts. He started with two-day fasts, and  eventually tried to stretch them to a week or more, breaking them carefully  with large amounts of water and leafy vegetables. “After a week you start to  feel fantastic,” he said. “You get a ton of vitality from not having to digest  all this food. I was in great shape. I felt I could get up and walk to San  Francisco anytime I wanted.”</p>

<p>乔布斯在读过20世纪初出生在德国的营养学狂热者阿诺德·埃雷特（ArnoldEhret）所著的《非黏液饮食治疗学》（MucuslessDietHealingSystem）一书后，饮食习惯变得更加怪异。埃雷特坚信饮食中只应该包括水果和不含淀粉的蔬菜，这样的话就可以防止身体产生有害的黏液；他还提倡定期通过长时间的绝食来清理身体。这就意味着，即使是麦片也不能再吃了一一还有所有的米饭、面包、谷类以及牛奶。乔布斯开始提醒朋友们，他们的百吉饼中也隐藏着黏液的危险。“我以我惯有的方式疯狂陷入其中。”他说。有一次，他和科特基整个星期都只吃苹果，之后乔布斯开始尝试更加纯粹的绝食。一开始先是两天不吃东西，最终发展到一周甚至更长的时间，然后通过摄入大量的水和多叶蔬菜来结束绝食。“一周过后，你就会有很美妙的感觉了，”他说，“不用消化食物,可以让你获得很多活力。我当时状态很好，我觉得自己随时可以走路去旧金山。”（埃雷特56岁那年因在步行时摔倒撞击到头部而丧生。）</p>

<p>Vegetarianism and Zen  Buddhism, meditation and spirituality, acid and rock—Jobs rolled together, in  an amped-up way, the multiple impulses that were hallmarks of the  enlightenment-seeking campus subculture of the era. And even though he barely  indulged it at Reed, there was still an undercurrent of electronic geekiness in  his soul that would someday combine surprisingly well with the rest of the mix. </p>



</div>
<div class="right">


<p>素食主义与佛教禅宗，冥想与灵性，迷幻药与摇滚乐——那个时代寻求自我启迪的校园文化中，这几样标志性的行为，被乔布斯以一种近乎疯狂的方式集于一身。尽管如此，他骨子里电子极客的唷流仍在涌动，并在将来的某一天与他身上的其他特质完美地结合。</p>

<p>In order to raise some  cash one day, Jobs decided to sell his IBM Selectric typewriter. He walked into  the room of the student who had offered to buy it only to discover that he was  having sex with his girlfriend. Jobs started to leave, but the student invited  him to take a seat and wait while they finished. “I thought, ‘This is kind of  far out,’” Jobs later recalled. And thus began his relationship with Robert  Friedland, one of the few people in Jobs’s life who were able to mesmerize him.  He adopted some of Friedland’s charismatic traits and for a few years treated  him almost like a guru—until he began to see him as a charlatan.</p>

<h4>罗伯特·弗里德兰</h4>


<p>有一次，为了筹集一些现金，乔布斯决定卖掉自己的IBM电动打字机。他走进之前答应要买的那个学生的宿舍，发现对方正在和女友云雨。乔布斯准备离开，但那个学生请他坐下，等他们结束。“我当时想：‘这太离谱了吧。’”乔布斯后来回忆说。他和罗伯特·弗里德兰（RobertFriedland）的友谊也从此开始。罗伯特是乔布斯一生中少有的能以自己的魅力蛊惑他的人。乔布斯吸收了罗伯特身上一些独具魅力的特质，有几年的时间甚至将他视为自己的精神导师——直到后来把他看做吹牛欺诈的髙手。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Friedland was four  years older than Jobs, but still an undergraduate. The son of an Auschwitz  survivor who became a prosperous Chicago architect, he had originally gone to  Bowdoin, a liberal arts college in Maine. But while a sophomore, he was  arrested for possession of 24,000 tablets of LSD worth $125,000. The local  newspaper pictured him with shoulder-length wavy blond hair smiling at the  photographers as he was led away. He was sentenced to two years at a federal  prison in Virginia, from which he was paroled in 1972. That fall he headed off  to Reed, where he immediately ran for student body president, saying that he  needed to clear his name from the “miscarriage of justice” he had suffered. He  won.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>弗里德兰比乔布斯大了4岁，但还在读本科。他的父亲是奥斯维辛集中营的幸存者，后来在芝加哥成为了一名成功的建筑师。弗里德兰原本是在缅因州的鲍登文理学院读书的。但是读大二的时候，他因为身上携带了价值125000美元的24000片迷幻药而被捕。当地报纸拍到了他被带走时的现场照片：一头及肩的波浪金发，正冲着摄影师微笑。他被判在弗吉尼亚州的一座联邦监狱服刑两年，于1972年被假释。那年秋天他来到了里德学院，立刻开始竞选学生会主席，他宣称需要洗刷“司法不公”强加给自己的罪名。他赢得了选举。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Friedland had heard  Baba Ram Dass, the author of Be Here Now, give a speech in Boston, and like  Jobs and Kottke had gotten deeply into Eastern spirituality. During the summer  of 1973, he traveled to India to meet Ram Dass’s Hindu guru, Neem Karoli Baba,  famously known to his many followers as Maharaj-ji. When he returned that fall,  Friedland had taken a spiritual name and walked around in sandals and flowing  Indian robes. He had a room off campus, above a garage, and Jobs would go there  many afternoons to seek him out. He was entranced by the apparent intensity of  Friedland’s conviction that a state of enlightenment truly existed and could be  attained. “He turned me on to a different level of consciousness,” Jobs said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>弗里德兰曾经听过《此时此地》的作者拉姆·达斯导师在波士顿的一次演讲，他和乔布斯、科特基一样深深迷恋着东方精神。1973年的夏天，弗里德兰去印度拜访了拉姆·达斯的印度教导师——尼姆·卡罗里大师（NeemKaroliBaba）,也就是信众们所熟知的马哈拉杰-吉（Maharaj-ji）。弗里德兰那年秋天从印度回来后，已经起了一个宗教名字，走到哪里都是一双凉鞋和一身飘逸的印度长袍。他在校园外租了一个房间，就在一个车库顶上，很多个下午，乔布斯都会去那里找他。弗里德兰确信自我启蒙的状态确实存在，并且可以通过努力而获得，这让乔布斯十分着迷。“他让我达到了一个全新层次的觉悟。”乔布斯说。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Friedland found Jobs  fascinating as well. “He was always walking around barefoot,” he later told a  reporter. “The thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever he was  interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme.” Jobs had  honed his trick of using stares and silences to master other people. “One of  his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to. He would stare into  their fucking eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without  the other person averting their eyes.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>弗里德兰也觉得乔布斯十分有魅力。“他总是赤着脚走来走去，”他后来回忆说，“让我感到震撼的是他的激情。他只要对一样东西感兴趣，就会把这种兴趣发挥到非理性的极致状态。”乔布斯熟练掌握了利用凝视和沉默来征服别人的技巧。“他的招数之一就是死死盯着正在和他讲话的人。他会一直注视着对方的眼球，然后问一个问题，要对方在不回避他目光的情况下回答。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>According to Kottke,  some of Jobs’s personality traits—including a few that lasted throughout his  career—were borrowed from Friedland. “Friedland taught Steve the reality  distortion field,” said Kottke. “He was charismatic and a bit of a con man and  could bend situations to his very strong will. He was mercurial, sure of  himself, a little dictatorial. Steve admired that, and he became more like that  after spending time with Robert.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>据科特基说，乔布斯的一些性格特质——包括一些伴随他职业生涯的特质——都是吸收自弗里德兰。“弗里德兰教给了史蒂夫现实扭曲力场，”科特基说，“他极富魅力，也会骗人，可以让事态屈从于他的超强意志。他很机智，充满自信，还有一点儿独断专行。史蒂夫很钦佩这些，他和罗伯特待在一起的时间久了之后，也变成了这个样子。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also absorbed how  Friedland made himself the center of attention. “Robert was very much an  outgoing, charismatic guy, a real salesman,” Kottke recalled. “When I first met  Steve he was shy and self-effacing, a very private guy. I think Robert taught  him a lot about selling, about coming out of his shell, of opening up and  taking charge of a situation.” Friedland projected a high-wattage aura. “He  would walk into a room and you would instantly notice him. Steve was the  absolute opposite when he came to Reed. After he spent time with Robert, some  of it started to rub off.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>乔布斯也从弗里德兰身上学会了怎样让自己成为焦点。“罗伯特是个非常善于交际也非常有魅力的人，一个真正的推销员，”科特基回忆说，“我第一次见到史蒂夫的时候，他羞涩又谦逊，非常内敛。我想是罗伯特教会了他怎样销售产品，怎样与别人交往，怎样展现自我，怎样控制局面。”弗里德兰身上的气场很强。“他走进一个房间，别人立刻就会注意到他。史蒂夫刚刚来到里德学院的时候则恰恰相反。他跟罗伯特相处一段时间后，身上的羞涩开始逐渐褪去。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On Sunday evenings  Jobs and Friedland would go to the Hare Krishna temple on the western edge of  Portland, often with Kottke and Holmes in tow. They would dance and sing songs  at the top of their lungs. “We would work ourselves into an ecstatic frenzy,”  Holmes recalled. “Robert would go insane and dance like crazy. Steve was more  subdued, as if he was embarrassed to let loose.” Then they would be treated to  paper plates piled high with vegetarian food.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>星期天的晚上，乔布斯和弗里德兰会去波特兰西边的哈雷·克里希纳寺，通常科特基和霍姆斯也会去。他们会用尽一切力气唱歌跳舞。“我们会让自己进入一种癫狂的状态，”霍姆斯回忆说，“罗伯特会失去理智一般疯狂地跳舞。史蒂夫则平静很多，完全释放自己似乎会让他觉得尷尬。”之后就会有人给他们奉上堆满了素食的纸盘子。</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Friedland had stewardship  of a 220-acre apple farm, about forty miles southwest of Portland, that was  owned by an eccentric millionaire uncle from Switzerland named Marcel Müller.  After Friedland became involved with Eastern spirituality, he turned it into a  commune called the All One Farm, and Jobs would spend weekends there with  Kottke, Holmes, and like-minded seekers of enlightenment. The farm had a main  house, a large barn, and a garden shed, where Kottke and Holmes slept. Jobs  took on the task of pruning the Gravenstein apple trees. “Steve ran the apple  orchard,” said Friedland. “We were in the organic cider business. Steve’s job  was to lead a crew of freaks to prune the orchard and whip it back into shape.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>弗里德兰管理着波特兰西南40英里处一家220英亩的苹果园，果园的主人是他一位来自瑞士的古怪的百万富翁叔叔，名叫马塞尔·穆勒（MarcelMilller），他靠垄断当时罗德西亚①的公制螺纹构件市场而发了财。弗里德兰在迷恋上东方宗教后，把这处果园改造成了一个公社，叫做团结农场（AllOneFarm），乔布斯、科特基和霍姆斯，以及其他一些寻求精神启蒙的人会在那里过周末。农场里有一座主楼，一座大仓库和一间花园小屋，科特基和霍姆斯就睡在花园小屋里。乔布斯和另一个公社成员格雷格·卡尔霍恩负责给格拉文施泰因苹果树剪枝。“史蒂夫管理着苹果园，”弗里德兰说，“我们当时在做有机苹果汁生意。史蒂夫的工作就是带领一群怪人给果树剪枝，然后把果园打扫干净。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Monks and disciples  from the Hare Krishna temple would come and prepare vegetarian feasts redolent  of cumin, coriander, and turmeric. “Steve would be starving when he arrived,  and he would stuff himself,” Holmes recalled. “Then he would go and purge. For  years I thought he was bulimic. It was very upsetting, because we had gone to  all that trouble of creating these feasts, and he couldn’t hold it down.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>哈雷·克里希纳寺的僧人和信徒们也会来农场，帮着准备素食盛宴，莳萝、香菜和姜黄的香味四处飘散。“史蒂夫来的时候总是很饿，于是就猛吃一通，”霍姆斯回忆说，“然后他就要去吐掉。很多年我都以为他有贪食症。这让我们非常苦恼，因为我们费尽周折才弄好一顿饭，但他却留不住食物。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs was also  beginning to have a little trouble stomaching Friedland’s cult leader style.  “Perhaps he saw a little bit too much of Robert in himself,” said Kottke. Although  the commune was supposed to be a refuge from materialism, Friedland began  operating it more as a business; his followers were told to chop and sell  firewood, make apple presses and wood stoves, and engage in other commercial  endeavors for which they were not paid. One night Jobs slept under the table in  the kitchen and was amused to notice that people kept coming in and stealing  each other’s food from the refrigerator. Communal economics were not for him.  “It started to get very materialistic,” Jobs recalled. “Everybody got the idea  they were working very hard for Robert’s farm, and one by one they started to  leave. I got pretty sick of it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>乔布斯开始有点儿无法忍受弗里德兰宗教领袖般的行事风格了。“也许他看到了太多弗里德兰的本质。”科特基如是说。尽管这个公社最初的目的是成为逃避物质主义的庇护所，但弗里德兰开始像做买卖一样管理公社。他的信徒们被要求砍柴然后出售柴火，生产苹果榨汁机和柴火炉子，参加各种商业活动但得不到报酬。有一天晚上，乔布斯睡在厨房的桌子下面，看着人们进进出出，从冰箱里偷别人的食物，他都被逗乐了。他不喜欢公社经济。“事情开始变得非常物质主义，”乔布斯回忆说，“每个人都了解到自己在为罗伯特的农场拼命工作，于是大家一个接一个地离开了。这一切让我觉得恶心。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Many years later,  after Friedland had become a billionaire copper and gold mining  executive—working out of Vancouver, Singapore, and Mongolia—I met him for  drinks in New York. That evening I emailed Jobs and mentioned my encounter. He  telephoned me from California within an hour and warned me against listening to  Friedland. He said that when Friedland was in trouble because of environmental  abuses committed by some of his mines, he had tried to contact Jobs to  intervene with Bill Clinton, but Jobs had not responded. “Robert always  portrayed himself as a spiritual person, but he crossed the line from being  charismatic to being a con man,” Jobs said. “It was a strange thing to have one  of the spiritual people in your young life turn out to be, symbolically and in  reality, a gold miner.” </p>



</div>
<div class="right">


<p>很多年以后，弗里德兰已经成为了一名亿万富翁，管理着铜矿和金矿——产业遍及温哥华、新加坡和蒙古——我在纽约与他相约小饮。那天晚上我给乔布斯发了电子邮件，提到了这次相遇。不到一个小时，他就从加州给我打电话，提醒我不要听信弗里德兰的话。他说，弗里德兰因为旗下的几处矿产破坏环境而陷入了麻烦，曾经打电话联系他，请求他与比尔·克林顿交涉，但乔布斯没有回应他。“罗伯特总是标榜自己是个精神至上的人，但他越过了从魅力到欺骗的界限，”乔布斯说，“你年轻的时候认识的某个号称精神至上的人最后变成了彻头彻尾的淘金者，这真是件非常奇怪的事情。”——</p>

<h3><a name="s4" id="s4"></a>...Drop Out </h3>

<p>Jobs quickly became  bored with college. He liked being at Reed, just not taking the required  classes. In fact he was surprised when he found out that, for all of its hippie  aura, there were strict course requirements. When Wozniak came to visit, Jobs  waved his schedule at him and complained, “They are making me take all these  courses.” Woz replied, “Yes, that’s what they do in college.” Jobs refused to  go to the classes he was assigned and instead went to the ones he wanted, such  as a dance class where he could enjoy both the creativity and the chance to  meet girls. “I would never have refused to take the courses you were supposed  to, that’s a difference in our personality,” Wozniak marveled.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<h3>退学</h3>

<p>乔布斯很快厌倦了大学生活。他喜欢待在里德学院，只是不想去上那些必修课。实际上，他惊讶地发现，尽管里德学院有着嬉皮士的氛围，但也有非常严格的课程要求，学生需要阅读《伊利亚特》这样的作品，还要研究伯罗奔尼撒战争史。沃兹来访的时候，乔布斯挥舞着自己的课程表抱怨说：“学校强迫我上这么多课程。”沃兹回答：“是的，大学就是这样的，他们会给你指定一些课程。”乔布斯拒绝去上那些必修课，而是去上自己感兴趣的课，比如舞蹈课，在那里他既可以享受艺术，还有机会见到女孩子。“我绝不会不去上必修课，这就是我们性格上的差异。”沃兹尼亚克感到十分诧异。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Jobs also began to  feel guilty, he later said, about spending so much of his parents’ money on an  education that did not seem worthwhile. “All of my working-class parents’  savings were being spent on my college tuition,” he recounted in a famous  commencement address at Stanford. “I had no idea what I wanted to do with my  life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was  spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided  to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">



<p>乔布斯后来说，把父母的钱花在了根本不值那么多钱的教育上，他也开始有负罪感。“我那工薪阶层的父母省下来的钱全花在学费上了，”他在那场著名的斯坦福大学毕业典礼演讲中提到，“我不知道自己想要千什么，也不知道大学能如何帮我搞清楚自己的人生目标。但我却在花着父母的毕生积蓄。所以我决定退学，我也相信，一切都会顺利。”</p>


</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He didn’t actually  want to leave Reed; he just wanted to quit paying tuition and taking classes  that didn’t interest him. Remarkably, Reed tolerated that. “He had a very  inquiring mind that was enormously attractive,” said the dean of students, Jack  Dudman. “He refused to accept automatically received truths, and he wanted to  examine everything himself.” Dudman allowed Jobs to audit classes and stay with  friends in the dorms even after he stopped paying tuition.</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>他并不是真的想离开里德学院，他只是不想再付学费，也不想再去上那些提不起他兴趣的课程了。惊人的是，校方竟然容忍了这一切。“他有一颗渴求知识的心，这很让人感兴趣，”教导主任杰克·达德曼（JackDixdman）说，“他拒绝不动脑筋地接受事实，任何事情他都要亲自检验。”即使在乔布斯停止交学费之后，达德曼还是允许他旁听课程，并且可以继续待在宿舍和朋友们在一起。</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“The minute I dropped  out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin  dropping in on the ones that looked interesting,” he said. Among them was a  calligraphy class that appealed to him after he saw posters on campus that were  beautifully drawn. “I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about  varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes  great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a  way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">


<p>“我一退学，就不用去上那些我不感兴趣的必修课了，我可以去上那些看起来有意思的课。”他说。这其中有一门书法课非常吸引他，因为他注意到校园里的大多数海报都画得很漂亮。“我学到了衬线字体和无衬线字体，怎样在不同的字母组合间调整其间距，以及怎样作出完美的版面设计。这其中所蕴涵的美、历史意味和艺术精妙之处是科学无法捕捉的，这让我陶醉。”</p>



</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was yet another  example of Jobs consciously positioning himself at the intersection of the arts  and technology. In all of his products, technology would be married to great  design, elegance, human touches, and even romance. He would be in the fore of  pushing friendly graphical user interfaces. The calligraphy course would become  iconic in that regard. “If I had never dropped in on that single course in  college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally  spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no  personal computer would have them.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right">

<p>这也再一次证明，乔布斯总是有意识地将自己置身于艺术与科技的交汇处。在他所有的产品中，科技必定与完美的设计、外观、手感、精致、人性化甚至是浪漫结合在一起。他是追求友好图形用户界面的先锋。在这一方面，那门书法课程是意义非凡的。“如果我大学的时候从没有上过那门课，麦金塔计算机里绝不会有那么多种字形以及间距安排合理的字体。既然是Windows抄袭了Mac，那么很有可能所有个人电脑上也不会有这些。”</p>




</div></div>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In the meantime Jobs  eked out a bohemian existence on the fringes of Reed. He went barefoot most of  the time, wearing sandals when it snowed. Elizabeth Holmes made meals for him,  trying to keep up with his obsessive diets. He returned soda bottles for spare  change, continued his treks to the free Sunday dinners at the Hare Krishna  temple, and wore a down jacket in the heatless garage apartment he rented for $20 a month. When he needed money, he  found work at the psychology department lab maintaining the electronic  equipment that was used for animal behavior experiments. Occasionally Chrisann  Brennan would come to visit. Their relationship sputtered along erratically.  But mostly he tended to the stirrings of his own soul and personal quest for  enlightenment.</p>
<p>“I  came of age at a magical time,” he reflected later. “Our consciousness was  raised by Zen, and also by LSD.” Even later in life he would credit psychedelic  drugs for making him more enlightened. “Taking LSD was a profound experience,  one of the most important things in my life. LSD shows you that there’s another  side to the coin, and you can’t remember it when it wears off, but you know it.  It reinforced my sense of what was important—creating great things instead of  making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human  consciousness as much as I could.”</div>
<div class="right">


<p>在此期间，乔布斯在里德学院作为一名边缘人物，过着放荡不羁的生活。他大多数时间都光脚走路，下雪天的时候穿着凉鞋。伊丽莎白·霍姆斯为他做饭，努力照顾到他过分的饮食习惯。他会拿汽水瓶去换零钱，继续每个周日去哈雷·克里希纳寺吃免费的素食，穿着羽绒服住在他以每月20美元的价格祖下的没有供暧的车库房间里。他需要钱的时候，就去心理学系的实验室，维护那些用于动物行为实验的电子设备。克里斯安·布伦南也会偶尔来访，他们的关系时好时坏。但他的主要精力还是放在自己的心灵以及对个人觉悟的追求上了。</p>
<p>“我当时身处一个神奇的时代，”他后来回忆说，“提升我们觉悟的是禅宗，还有迷幻药。”即便是后来，他依然赞扬致幻剂让自己得到了更多启发：“使用迷幻药是一段意义非凡的经历，也是我一生中最重要的事情之一。迷幻药让你看到硬币的另一面，当药效退去之后你就记不清楚了，但你知道有这么一回事。它让我更清楚什么是重要的——创造伟大的发明，而不是赚钱。应该尽我所能，将此生放回历史和人类思想的长河。”</p>
