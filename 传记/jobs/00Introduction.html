<div class="left">
<p>In the early summer of 2004, I got a phone call from Steve Jobs.  He had been scattershot friendly to me over the years, with occasional bursts of intensity, especially when he was launching a new product that he wanted on the cover of <em>Time</em> or featured on CNN, places where I'd worked.  But now that I was no longer at either of those places, I handn't heard from him much. We talked a bit about the Aspen Institute, which I had recently joined, and I invited him to speak at our summer campus in Colorado. He'd be happy to come, he said, but not to be onstage, He wanted instead to take a walk so that we could talk. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">

<p>2004年的初夏，我接到史蒂夫·乔布斯（SteveJobs）打来的电话。多年来，他对我还算友好，偶尔还会感情骤增一下，特别是当他希望即将推出的新产品能上《时代》杂志封面或者CNN（美国有线电视新闻网）专题报道的时候，而这两处恰好都是我曾工作过的地方。在我离开这两家媒体之后，就没有太多他的消息了。电话里我们谈论了一些关于我刚刚加入的阿斯彭研究所（AspenInstitute）的情况，我遨请他来科罗拉多的校园演讲。他说他很乐意，但不想登台讲话，而是想和我散散步、聊聊天。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That seemed a bit odd.  I didn't yet know that taking a long walk was his preferred way to have a serious conversation.  It turned out that he wanted me to write a biography of him. I had recently published one on Benjamin Franklin and was writing one about Albert Einstein, and my initial reaction was to wonder, half jokingly, whether he saw himself as the natural successor in that sequence. Because I assumed that he was still in the middle of an oscillating career that had many more ups and downs left, I demurred. Not now, I said. Maybe in a decade or two, when you retire. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>这番话听上去有点奇怪，因为当时我还不知道他喜欢在散步的过程中进行严肃的对话。后来我才知道，他是想让我写一本关于他的传记。我刚刚出版了本杰明·富兰克林（BenjaminFranMin）的传记, 正在着手完成阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦（AlbertEinstein）的传记。因此我最初的反应是，他是不是把自己看做这些伟人的继承人了。当然这是半开玩笑的。我认为他还处在事业的波动期，等待他的还有诸多跌宕起伏，所以我拒绝了他的请求。现在还不是时候，我说，再等个十年二十年，等你退休了。</p>
</div>

<p>I had known him since 1984, when he came to Manhattan to have lunch with <em>Time</em>'s editors and extol his new macintosh. He was petulant even then, attacking a <em>Time</em> correspondent for having wounded him with a story that was too revealing. But talking to him afterward, I found myself rather captivated, as so many others have been over the years, by his engaging intensity. We stayed in touch, even after he was ousted from Apple. When he had something to pitch, such as a NeXT computer or Pixar movie, the beam of his charm would suddenly refocus on me, and he would take me to a sushi restaurant in Lower Manhattan to tell me that whatever he was <a href="#" title="tout
美 [taʊt] 英 [taʊt] v. 兜售；吹捧；推销；标榜
n. （音乐会、体育比赛等的）卖高价票的人
">touting</a> was the best thing he had ever produced. I liked him. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="right">
<p>我认识他是在1984年，当时他来曼哈顿的时代-生活大厦（Time-LifeBuilding）与编辑们共进午餐，顺带夸耀他的麦金塔电脑（Macintosh）。那个时候他的脾气就不太好，他攻击《时代》杂志的一名记者，因为对方报道的一个故事暴露了太多事实而让他觉得受到了伤害。但后来，通过与他的对话，我发现自己被他的强烈情感所吸引，就如同其他很多人多年来受到的吸引一样。自那以后，我们就一直保持联系，即便在他被迫离开苹果公司时也未中断。当他需要推销某样产品时，比如一台NeXT电脑或者一部皮克斯（Pixar）出品的电影，他的个人魅力就会突然间再次聚焦到我的身上，他会带我去曼哈顿下城的一家寿司餐厅，告诉我他正在兜售的东西是他制造出的最棒的产品。我喜欢这个家伙。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When he was restored to the throne at Apple, we put him on the cover of <em>Time</em>, and soon thereafter he began offering me this ideas for a series we were doing on the most influential people of the century. He had launched his "Think Different" campaign, featuring iconic photos of some of the same people we were considering, and he found the endeavor of assessing historic influence fascinating. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>乔布斯重新执掌苹果公司之后，我们将他搬上了《时代》杂志的封面，此后不久，他就开始给我们正在做的20世纪最有影响力人物系列专题出谋划策。当时他已经展开了“非同凡想”（ThinkDifferent）的宣传活动，在他的电视广告片里出现的众多历史人物中，有一些也正是我们在考虑的，而乔布斯发现，评估人物的历史影响力很有意思。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>After I had deflected his suggestion that I write a biography of him, I heard from him every now and then. At one point I emailed to ask if it was true, as my daughter had told me, that the Apple logo was an homage to Alan Turing, the British computer pioneer who broke the German wartime codes and then committed suicide by biting into a cyanide-laced apple. He replied that he wished he had thought of that, but hadn't. That started an exchange about the early history of Apple, and I found myself gathering string on the subject, just in case I ever decided to do such a book. When my Einstein biography came out, he came to a book event in Palo Alto and pulled me aside to suggest, again, that he would make a good subject. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>在拒绝了帮他写传记的建议后，我还是时不时收到一些他的消息。有一次，我发电子邮件询问他，苹果公司的标识是不是如同我女儿告诉我的一样，是在向伟大的英国计算机先驱阿兰·图灵（AlanTuring）致敬。图灵破译了战争时期德国的电码，最后却食用浸过氰化物的苹果自杀了。乔布斯回复我说，他希望自己曾经考虑过这一点，但实际上并没有。从这件事起，我开始逐渐了解苹果公司的早期历史，并一点一点搜集这方面的资料，没准儿哪天我想写一本这方面的书呢。我的爱因斯坦传记出版后，有一次，在帕洛奥图的一个新书活动上，乔布斯把我拉到一边，再一次提出，以他为主题的书肯定很有意思。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His persistence baffled me. He was known to guard his privacy, and I had no reason to believe he'd ever read any of my books. Maybe someday, I continued to say. But in 2009 his wife, Laurene powell, said bluntly, "If you're ever going to do a book on Steve, you'd better do it now. "He had just taken a second medical leave. I confessed to her that when he had first raised the idea, I hadn't known he was sick. Almost nobody knew, she said. He had called me right before he was going to be operated on for cancer, and he was still keeping it a secret, she explained. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>他的坚持让我很为难。众所周知他非常注意保护自己的隐私，而我想他应该从来没有看过我写的书。也许将来的某个时候吧，我还是这么说。但是，到了2009年，他的妻子劳伦·鲍威尔（LaurenePowell）对我直言不讳地说：“如果你真的打算写一本关于史蒂夫的书，最好现在就开始。”他当时刚刚第二次因病休假。我向劳伦坦承，当乔布斯第一次提出这个想法时，我并不知道他病了。几乎没有人知道，她说。他是在接受癌症手术之前给我打的电话，直到今天他还将此事作为一个秘密，她这么解释道。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>I decided then to write this book. Jobs surprised me by readily acknowledging that he would have no control over it or even the right to see it in advance. "It's your book, "he said. "I won't even read it. "But later that fall he seemed to have second thoughts about cooperating and, though I didn't know it, was hit by another round of cancer complications. He stopped returning my calls, and I put the project aside for a while. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>就在那个时候，我决定要写这本书了。让我惊喜的是，乔布斯欣然允诺，他不会干涉这本书的写作过程，甚至不会提前阅读它。“这是你的书，”他说，“我不会看的。”但那年秋天的晚些时候，他似乎对于合作有了犹豫，而我不知道的是，他被又一轮癌症并发症侵袭了。他不再回我的电话，我也把这个项目放到了一边。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Then, unexpectedly, he phoned me late on the afternoon of New Year's Eve 2009. He was at home in Palo Alto with only his siter, the writer Mona Simpson. His wife and their three children had taken a quick trip to go skiing, but he was not healthy enough to join them. He was in a reflective mood, and we talked for more than an hour. He began by recalling that he had wanted to build a frequency counter when he was twelve, and he was able to look up Bill Hewlett, the founder of HP, in the phone book and call him to get parts. Jobs said that the past twelve years of his life, since his return to Apple, had been his most productive in terms of creating new products. But his more important goal, he said, was to do what Hewlett and his friend David Packard had done, which was create a company that was so imbued with innovative creativity that it would outlive them. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>之后，很出人意料的，他在2009年末新年前夜的傍晚给我打来了电话。他在帕洛奥图的家中，陪伴他的只有他的妹妹，作家莫娜·辛普森（MonaSimpson）。妻子劳伦和三个孩子去滑雪了，身体状况让他未能成行。他追思往事，跟我聊了一个多小时。他先是回忆自己12岁的时候曾经想要做一个频率计数器，当时他在电话簿上查到了惠普的创始人比尔·休利特（BillHewlett）的号码，并给他打电话，想要得到一些零部件。乔布斯说，他重新回到苹果公司的这12年，从创造新产品的角度来说，是他最髙产的一个阶段。但他还有一个更重要的目标，他说，就是像休利特和戴维·帕卡德（DavidPackard）—样，建立一家充满了革命性创造力的公司，而且这家公司要比惠普更能经受岁月长河的涤荡。</p>
</div>

<p>"I always thought of myslef as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked eletronics, "he said. "Then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do. "It was as if he were suggesting themes for his biography(and in this instance, at least, the theme turned out to be valid). The creativity that can occur when a feel for both the humanities and the sciences combine in one strong personality was the topic that most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating innovative economies in the twenty-first century. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>“我小的时候，一直都以为自己是个适合人文学科的人，但我喜欢电子设备，”他说，“然后我看到了我的偶像之一，宝丽来创始人埃德温·兰德（EdwinLand）说的一些话，是关于既揎长人文又能驾驭科学的人的重要性的，于是我决定，我要成为这样的人。”这好像是他在向我暗示这本传记的主题（这一次，这个主题至少是合理的）。在我写的富兰克林以及爱因斯坦的传记中，最让我感兴趣的话题就是，一个具有强烈个性的人身上集合了人文和科学的天赋后所能产生的那种创造力，我相信这种创造力也是在21世纪建立创新型经济的关键因素。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>I asked Jobs why he wanted me be the one to write his biography. "I think you're good at getting people to talk, "he replied. That was an unexpected answer. I knew that I would have to interview scores of people he had fired, abused, abandoned, or otherwise infuriated, and I feared he would not be comfortable with my getting them to talk. And indeed he did turn out to be <a href="#" title="美 ['skɪtɪʃ] 英 ['skɪtɪʃ] adj. 易惊而难以驾驭的；轻浮的；易变的；反复无常的

">skittish</a> when word trickled back to him of people that I was interviewing. But after a couple of months, he began encouraging people to talk to me, even foes and former girlfriends. Nor did he try to put anythins off-limits. "I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when I was twenty-three and the way I handled that, "he said. "But I don't have any skeletons in my closet that can't be allowed out. "
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>我问乔布斯为什么希望我担任这本传记的作者。“我觉得你很擅长让别人开口说话。”他这么回答。这个答案有些出乎我的意料。我知道我必须采访很多人，这些人要么被他炒过鱿鱼，要么被他伤害过、遗弃过，抑或被他以其他方式激怒过，我以为我跟这些人交谈会让乔布斯不舒服。的确，当我的一些采访对象的言论传到乔布斯耳中时，他表现得有些愤怒。但几个月后，他开始鼓励人们跟我交流，这其中甚至包括他的敌人和前女友。他也没有对任何事情作出限制。“我做过很多并不值得自豪的事情，比如23岁时让我的女友怀了孕，以及我处理此事的方式，”他说，“但我没有什么不能对外袒露的。”</p>

<p>He didn't seek any control over what I wrote, or even ask to read it in advance. His only involvement came when my publisher was choosing the cover art. When he saw an early version of a proposed cover treatment, he disliked it so much that he asked to have input in designing a new version. I was both amused and willing, so i readily assented. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">

<div class="left">
<p>I ended up having more than forty interviews and conversations with him. Some were formal ones in his Palo Alto living room, others were done during long walks and drives or by telephone. During my two years of visites, he became inreasingly intimate and revealing, though at times I witnessed what his veteran colleagues at Apple used to call his "reality distortion field. "Sometimes it was the <a href="#" title="美 [ˌɪnədˈvərtənt] 英 [ˌɪnəd'vɜ:tənt] adj. 疏忽的；漫不经心的；出于无心的

</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>我总共与他进行了差不多40次会面。其中一些是很正式的谈话，在他位于帕洛奥图的住所的客厅里进行，还有一些是在长途散步或者驱车行进的过程中完成的，或者是通过电话。在我18个月的访问中，他与我越来越亲近，也越来越愿意向我吐露心声，但是有时候我还是可以感受到他身上那种被苹果的老同事们称为“现实扭曲力场”（realitydistortionfield）的力量。有时，这是我们每个人都会有的因疏忽引起的记忆错误，但有些时候，乔布斯则是在向我也向自己，编织现实在他头脑中的印象。为了验证并充实他的故事，我采访了100多人，包括他的朋友、亲戚、对手、敌人以及同事。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">

<p>His wife also did not request any restrictions or control, nor did she ask to see in advance what I would publish. In fact she strongly encouraged me to be honest about his failings as well as his strengths. She is one of the smartest and most grounded people I have ever met. "There are parts of his life and personality that are extremely messy, and that's truth, "She told me early on. "You shouldn't whitewash it. He's good at spin, but he also has a remarkable story, and I'd like to see that it's all told truthfully. "
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>他的妻子劳伦不仅促成了本书，而且希望我的写作不受约束或控制，也没有要求提前看到书的内容。事实上，她还鼓励我坦率地描述乔布斯的全部：他的优点以及他的缺点。她是我见过的最聪明也是最理性的人之一。“他的生活以及性格中，有一部分是非常糟糕的，这是事实她早先告诉我，“你不用为他掩饰。他很擅长讲故事，但他的故事本身也非常精彩，我希望看到整个故事都被如实地叙述。”</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>I leave it to the reader to assess whether I have succeeded in this mission. I'm sure there are players in this drama who will remember some of the events differently or think that I sometimes got trapped in Jobs's distortion field. As happened when I wrote a book about Henry Kissinger, which in some ways was good preparation for this project, I found that people had such strong positive and negative emotions about Jobs that the Rashomon effect was often evident. But I've done the best I can to balance conflicting accounts fairly and be transparant about the sources I used. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>这项使命完成得怎样，我交给读者们判断。我确信会有一些人的记忆有别于书中所述，或者有人认为我陷入了他的扭曲力场之中。在我写一本关于亨利·基辛格（HenryKissinger）的书时也有类似的经历，那本书在某种程度上为本书提供了有益的借鉴。我发现人们对于乔布斯有着十分强烈的肯定或否定的情感，罗生门效应十分明显。但我已尽自己所能公正地去平衡不同意见，并对信息来源做到透明。</p>

<p>Tis is a book about the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrpreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. You might even adds seventh, retail stores, which Jobs did not quite revolutionize but did reimagine. In addition, he opened the way for a new market for digital content based on apps rather than just websites. Along the way he produced not only transforming products but also, on his second try, a lasting company, endowed with his DNA, that is filled with creative designers and daredevil engineers who could carry forward his vision. In August 2011, right before he stepped down as CEO, the enterprise he started in his parents' garage became the world's most valuable company. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>这是一本关于一个富有创造力的企业家的书，关于他过山车一般的人生，关于他炽热强烈的个性。他对完美的狂热以及积极的追求彻底变革了六大产业：个人电脑、动画电影、音乐、移动电话、平板电脑和数字出版。你可能还会想到第七个产业：连锁商店。对于零售连锁产业他算不上彻底变革，但的确重新描绘了这个产业的画面。此外，他通过开发应用程序，为数字内容开辟了一个全新的市场，而不再像以前一样只能依赖网站。随着时间的推移，他不仅制造出革命性的产品，还在自己的第二次努力下成就了一家充满生命力的公司，这家公司继承了他的基因，集中了一群极富想象力的设计师和大胆创新的工程师，他们能够将他的设想发扬光大。</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>This is also, I hope, a book about innovation. At a time when the United States is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build creative digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness, imagination, and sustained innovation. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology, so he built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. He and his colleagues at Apple were able to think differently:They developed not merely modest product advances based on focus groups, but whole new devices and services that consumers did not yet know they needed. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>我希望这也能是一本关于创新的书。如今，美国正在寻找方法保持自身的创新优势，全世界都在努力建设创造性的数字时代经济，乔布斯成为了创造力、想象力以及持续创新的终极标志。他深知21世纪创造价值的最佳途径就是将创造力与科技结合起来，所以他创建了一家公司，在这里，想象力的跳跃与高超的工程学技术被结合到一起。他和他的同事们能够以全新的方式思考：他们开发的并非是针对目标人群的普通产品改进，而是消费者还没有意识到其需求的全新设备和服务。</p>

<p>He was not a model boss or human being, tidily packaged for emulation. Driven by demons, he could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and passions and products were all inter-related, just as Apple's hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is thus both instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. 
</p>
</div>
  <div class="right">
<p>他不是众人尽可效仿的模范老板，或是人类楷模。他就像被恶魔驱使一样，可以让身边的人狂怒和绝望。但他的个性、激情与他的产品之间是相互关联的，就好像苹果的硬件和软件一样，各为整体系统的一部分。因此，他的故事既有启发性，也有告诫意义，其中充满了创新、品质、领导力和价值观方面的经验。</p>
