<div class='layout'><p> (1966–74   AGE 72–80)</p><p>1966～1974 年    72～80 岁</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>IN AUGUST 1966, Mao toppled Liu Shao-chi. On the 5th, after Liu met a delegation from Zambia in his capacity as president, Mao had Chou En-lai telephone Liu and tell him to stop meeting foreigners, or appearing in public, unless told to do so. That day, Mao wrote a tirade against Liu which he himself read out to the Central Committee two days later, in Liu's presence, breaking the news of Liu's downfall (the general population was not told). Just before this, on the 6th, Mao had had Lin Biao specially fetched to Peking to lend him weight, in case there was unmanageable opposition. Lin Biao formally replaced Liu as Mao's No. 2.</p><p>一九六六年八月五日，在刘少奇以国家主席身分会见了赞比亚代表团之后，毛泽东通过周恩来打电话给刘，要刘不要再见外国人，也不要再公开露面。同一天，毛写了针对刘的“大字报”：《炮打司令部》。两天后当着刘的面把这篇文章印发给中央全会，向中共高层公开了刘的倒台。毛散发文章之前，特意把不爱开会的林彪接来会场，给他撑腰壮声势。林彪紧接着正式取代刘当上了中国的第二号人物。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao's persecution of the man he hated most could now begin. He started with Liu's wife, Wang Guang-mei. Mao knew that the two were devoted to each other, and that making Guang-mei suffer would hurt Liu greatly.</p><p>毛开始收拾他最痛恨的人了。他从整王光美入手。毛知道刘俩口子是恩爱夫妻，整在王光美身上会痛在刘少奇心上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Guang-mei came from a distinguished cosmopolitan family: her father had been a government minister and diplomat, and her mother a well-known figure in education. Guang-mei had graduated in physics from an American missionary university, and had been about to take up an offer from Michigan University to study in America in 1946 when she decided to join the Communists, under the influence of her radical mother. People remembered how at dancing parties in the Communist base in those civil war days, Liu would cross the threshing-ground that served as a dance floor with his characteristic sure steps and, bowing, ask for a dance, in a manner unusual for a Party leader. Guang-mei had elegance and style, and Liu was smitten. They were married in 1948, and the marriage was an exceptionally happy one, particularly for Liu, who had had a string of unsuccessful relationships (and one wife executed by the Nationalists).</p><p>王光美出身官宦家庭，父亲在民国时代曾任中国农商部代理总长，母亲是着名的教育家。一九二一年父亲在华盛顿开会时王光美出世，取名“光美”以作纪念。光美毕业于美国教会办的辅仁大学物理系，一九四六年，她本来准备接受密西根大学的奖学金，由于亲共的母亲的影响，决定不去美国了，参加了共产党。在中共根据地，人们记得打麦场上的跳舞会里，她穿着白衬衣、蓝色工装裤，秀丽而洋气。刘少奇迈着稳稳的步子，穿过舞场，走到她面前，微微一鞠躬，请她跳舞。这个举动在当时很特出，一般是女孩子们主动过来请首长跳舞。有过几次不幸婚姻的刘少奇，爱上了优雅而有大家风范的王光美。他们于一九四八年结婚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From the moment it was clear that Mao was coming after Liu, from the Conference of the Seven Thousand in January 1962, Guang-mei encouraged her husband to stand up to Mao. This was in vivid contrast to the behavior of many leaders' wives, who urged their spouses to kowtow. In the ensuing years, she helped Liu to entrench his position. In June 1966, when Mao was fomenting violence in schools and universities, Liu made a last-ditch attempt to curb the mayhem by sending in “work teams,” and Guang-mei became a member of the one sent to Qinghua University in Peking. There she came into collision with a twenty-year-old militant called Kuai Da-fu. Kuai's original interest in politics had been sparked by a sense of justice: as a boy of thirteen in a village during the famine, he had petitioned Peking about grassroots officials ill-treating peasants. But when, in summer 1966, the Cultural Revolution was presented by the media as a “struggle for power,” Kuai developed an appetite for power and led riotous actions to “seize power from the work team.” He was put under dormitory arrest by the work team for eighteen days, which Liu authorized.</p><p>在七千人大会上，刘捋了毛的虎须。面对临头大祸，王光美没有像有的夫人那样劝丈夫向毛磕头请罪，反而与丈夫配合默契，协助丈夫巩固地位，使毛难以对他下手。* 一九六六年六月，毛在学校挑起暴力时，刘想制止混乱，派“工作组”進校管理。王光美成了清华大学工作组的成员。在清华，她同二十岁的激進学生蒯大富发生了冲突。蒯大富对政治的兴趣最初出于正义感，十三岁时他给北京写信状告基层干部腐败、欺压老百姓。文革开始后，《人民日报》把文革称为“争夺领导权的斗争”， 蒯开始有了权力欲。在一次工作组召开的大会上，他跟一帮学生把工作组轰下台，向工作组夺权。根据刘少奇的指示，蒯大富被工作组关了十八天。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>* 就是在这个背景下她被卷進了“四清”，搞了个“桃园经验”。桃园的打击对象是大队党支部书记吴臣，原因是吴“胡作非为，敲诈勒索，贪赃枉法”，大饥荒中打人，“有人证的，是三十一个人，三十九次”。吴臣被撤职。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the small hours of 1 August, Kuai was woken up by cars screeching to a halt to find before him none other than Chou En-lai. Kuai was completely overwhelmed. He could not make himself sit properly on the sofa, but perched on the edge. Suavely putting him at his ease, Chou told him he had come on behalf of Mao, and quizzed him about the work team—and the role of Mme Liu. Even though he had a stenographer with him, Chou took notes himself. The session lasted three hours, until after 5:00 AM, when Chou invited Kuai to come to the Great Hall of the People that evening. There they talked for another three hours. Mao used Kuai's complaints as ammunition, and from now on Kuai was Mao's point man against the Lius.</p><p>七月三十一日晚，蒯大富接到通知，到清华招待所去，有人要见他。他等到凌晨两点钟，在沙发上睡着了。有人摇醒了他，门外是汽车煞车的声音。突然，周恩来走進来。蒯大富说，他当时“特别吃惊，做梦也想不到周恩来会到跟前来”。他站起来，“有受宠若惊的感觉”。周恩来请他坐，他“根本连坐也不敢坐，屁股挨着沙发那么一点”。周恩来“很轻松”地、“非常有魅力”地、“很容易沟通”地让他放松下来，接着说自己来是“受主席的委托，向你了解清华的文化大革命的情况”。周恩来的问题是关于工作组的，当然也关于王光美。尽管周带来一个速记员，他自己也做笔记。蒯一直讲了三个小时，到太阳升起。周说他还有工作要先回去，约晚上派车来接蒯，到人民大会堂再继续谈。晚上他们又谈了近三个小时。由于蒯大富对刘少奇夫妇的不满，他成了毛手头上整刘的利器。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On 25 December, the eve of Mao's seventy-third birthday, on the orders of the Small Group, Kuai led 5,000 students in a parade through Peking with trucks fitted with loudspeakers blaring “Down with Liu Shao-chi!” This unusual demonstration was a step towards preparing people for the fact that the president of China was about to become an enemy, and even though it was not announced in the media, it made Liu's fall known to the nation. Kuai and his “demonstration” also enabled Mao to make it seem that Liu's downfall was by some sort of popular demand.</p><p>十二月二十五日，毛七十三岁生日前夕，在“中央文革”指示下，蒯率领五千名造反派学生在北京游行，散传单，呼口号，卡车上安装的高音喇叭大喊：“打倒刘少奇！”国家主席垮台的消息便以这种方式向全国公开，报纸上仍只字不提。利用蒯大富，毛装作打倒刘是“造反派的要求”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From here on, the Lius were tormented in countless ways. At dawn on New Year's Day 1967, Mao sent New Year greetings to his old colleague by getting staff in Zhongnanhai to daub giant insults inside the Lius' house. Similar menaces followed, all choreographed—except one.</p><p>一九六七年元旦，毛对刘的“新年问候”是派中南海造反派到刘家，在屋里屋外写满侮辱刘的大标语。过了两天，又一群人闯進刘家，围攻刘少奇夫妇，“勒令”他们做这做那。这类事接二连三，都是精心策划的 -- 只除了一件事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This was on 6 January, when Kuai's group seized the Lius' teenage daughter, Ping-ping, and then telephoned Guang-mei to tell her that the girl had been hit by a car and was in a hospital, which needed consent to perform an amputation. Both parents raced to the hospital, which discomfited the Rebels. Kuai recounted:</p><p>那是一月六日，蒯大富的手下把刘的孩子平平扣起来，然后给刘家打电话说平平出了车祸，被汽车轧断了腿，现在医院里，需要家长来签字后动手术截肢。刘少奇夫妇焦急万分，一同跔去医院。造反派本来只是想把王光美骗出来斗争一番取乐，没想到刘少奇也来了，吓了一跳。蒯大富说：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The students never thought Liu Shao-chi would come, and they were all frightened. They knew they couldn't touch Liu Shao-chi … the Centre had given no instructions [about handling Liu in person]. We dared not be rash … We knew this kind of “Down with” in politics could well turn to “Up with” … Without clear and specific instructions from the Centre, when it came to blame, we would have had it. So my pals asked Liu to go back, and kept Wang Guang-mei.</p><p>“同学们根本没想到刘少奇也会来，吓着了，也知道不敢动刘少奇。前几天，十二月二十五日，我们喊打倒刘少奇。刘少奇真在跟前时，还不敢喊。中央没有指示，不敢贸然行动，怕犯大错误。这种打倒，我们心里也是有数的，政治上的打倒，走马灯似的来回转，你也说不清什么时候就变。没有得到中央明确指示，将来追究责任，你负担不起的。所以我们同学就说：刘少奇你回去，王光美留下。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This is a good self-confession of how the Rebels really worked; they were tools, and cowards, and they knew it.</p><p>这番自白道出了造反派的自知之明，他们不是真正的造反者，只是工具。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> As this stunt had not been centrally orchestrated, soldiers descended on the hospital within minutes. The students scurried nervously through the motions of denouncing Guang-mei in just half an hour. While this was going on, Kuai was called to the phone, which, he remembered, gave me a big fright when the voice on the line said. “This is Chou En-lai.” Chou told me to release Wang Guang-mei: “No beating, no humiliation. Do you understand?” I said: “I understand” … He hung up. Less than a minute later, another call came. It was from Jiang Qing—my only call ever from her. As I took the phone, I heard her giggling. She said: “You got Wang Guang-mei. What's all this? Are you fooling around? Don't beat her, don't humiliate her.” She repeated Chou En-lai's words and said: “The premier is anxious, and asked me to telephone you. As soon as you finish denouncing Wang Guang-mei, send her back.”</p><p>因为这场戏不是上面安排的，中央警卫团的一个排降临了，带走了刘少奇。学生们紧张地草草斗争了王光美半个小时。这时电话响了，蒯大富说：“我拿起电话，把我吓了一跳，对方说：“我是周恩来。孙岳同志[周的秘书]到了你那里？”我说到了。他说：“王光美你不是也斗了吗？”我说斗了。他问：“斗完没有？”我说斗完了。他说：“那叫孙岳同志带回来，不准打，不准侮辱，听见没有？”我说听到了，我没有打，没有侮辱。我说放心，马上让孙岳带过去。他就把电话挂了。一分钟不到，又来电话，这次是江青来的电话。我唯一的一次接江青的电话。我一拿起电话就听江青在电话里哈哈笑。她说：“你们把王光美弄过去了，你们干嘛，瞎闹呀？你们不要打，不要侮辱。”她重复周恩来的话，说：“总理不放心，他要我打电话给你，你们斗完了赶快把王光美送回来。””</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So ended the only spontaneous move by the Rebels against the Lius. Chou's order to spare Guang-mei was not made out of the kindness of his heart. Kuai's action was unauthorized, and did not fit in with Mao's timetable.</p><p>蒯大富要江青放心。针对刘少奇夫妇的唯一一场自发行动就此告终。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao's next step was to have Liu brought to Suite 118 in the Great Hall for a tête-à-tête in the middle of the night on 13 January. Mao showed he was well aware of the hoax played on the Lius by inquiring: “How are Ping-ping's legs?” He then advised Liu to “read some books,” mentioning two titles both having the word “mechanical” in them, which Mao claimed were by Heidegger and Diderot. This was a way of advising Liu to be less stiff-necked, meaning he should do some kowtowing. Liu did not grovel, but repeated the offer he had made many times: to resign and go and work as a peasant. He asked Mao to stop the Cultural Revolution and punish only him, and not to harm anybody else. Mao waxed non-committal, and merely asked Liu to look after his health. With this he saw Liu, his closest colleague for nearly three decades, to the door for the last time—and to a slow and agonizing death.</p><p>周恩来这样关切是因为毛整刘有他的步骤。一月十三日夜里，毛把刘用车接到人民大会堂一一八厅，同刘進行了一次单独谈话。造反派的那场闹剧毛完全知道，明知故问：“平平的腿好了没有？”他建议刘读几本书，特别提到《机械唯物主义》和《机械人》，说是海德格(Martin Heidegger)和狄德罗(Denis Diderot)写的。从书名可以看出，毛是要刘少奇不要太“机械”，太死板，要刘违心地认罪。刘没有照毛说的办，而是向毛再次要求辞去一切职务，下乡当农民种地。他要求毛结束文革，只惩罚他一个人，不要整其他干部，不要让国家再受损失。毛不置可否，只向刘告别，要刘保重身体。就这样，毛把跟他共事将近三十年的副手送到门口，送上死路。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>WITHIN DAYS THE Lius' telephones were cut off. House arrest was now total, with the walls covered with enormous insulting posters and slogans. On 1 April, Mao made Liu's purge official to the general public by having him condemned as “the biggest capitalist-roader” in People's Daily. Right after this, Kuai organized a rally 300,000 strong to humiliate and abuse Guang-mei. Chou discussed the details with Kuai beforehand, and on the day itself Chou's office kept in constant contact by phone with Kuai's group. </p><p>几天后，刘的电话被强行拆除，他的家成了与世隔绝、墙壁地上满是侮辱性标语的牢房。四月一日，毛通过“中央文革”的戚本禹在《人民日报》发表文章，不点名地宣布刘是“党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派”。紧接着，由周恩来批准，蒯大富组织了一场有三十万人参加的对王光美的批斗会。会前，周同蒯详细讨论了议程。开会时，周恩来办公室同蒯的组织保持着密切的电话联系。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mme Mao added her personal touch by telling Kuai: “When Wang Guang-mei was in Indonesia, she lost all face for the Chinese. She even wore a necklace!” Mme Mao also accused Guang-mei of wearing traditional Chinese dresses “to make herself a whore with Sukarno in Indonesia,” and told Kuai: “You must find those things and make her wear them.” Mme Mao had been bitterly jealous of Guang-mei being able to wear glamorous clothes when she went abroad as the president's wife, while she herself was cooped up in China, where these things were not allowed.</p><p>一向嫉妒王光美的江青乘机报了私仇。王光美以国家主席夫人身分陪刘少奇出国，穿着漂亮的衣服，戴着首饰，而江青待在中国哪里也去不了，这些美丽的东西可望而不可即。她对蒯大富说：“王光美当时在印尼丢尽了中国人的脸，还戴项链！”“穿那些衣服与苏加诺吊膀子”。她叫蒯大富“把那些东西找出来，给她戴上穿上！” </p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kuai recalled that Mme Mao “was telling me explicitly, in effect, to humiliate Wang Guang-mei … </p><p>蒯回忆道：“江青是暗示--而且是明示 -- 就是要羞辱王光美，我们怎么批都行。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We could insult her any way we wanted.” So a traditional Chinese tight dress was forced on to Guang-mei, over her padded clothing, making her body appear bulging and ugly. A string of ping-pong balls was hung around her neck to signify a pearl necklace. The whole rally was filmed by cameramen, undoubtedly for Mao, as it could not have been done without his authorization.</p><p>于是蒯的人把一件中国旗袍罩在王光美身上。因为天冷，光美穿着毛衣，紧身的旗袍被硬套在上面，绷得鼓鼓囊囊的。脖子上给她挂了一串乒乓球，表示珍珠项链。整个大会都拍了新闻纪录片，蒯大富事后看了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the Maos failed to break Guang-mei. During the pre-rally interrogation, she showed extraordinary fearlessness—and a quick wit—and defended her husband eloquently. When she was hauled onto the stage to face the crowd's blood-curdling screams and upthrust fists, her interrogators asked her: “Aren't you scared?” Her calm answer impressed them: “No, I am not.”</p><p>要是毛本人也看了，他能看到，王光美没有屈服。在批斗会前的审问中，她针锋相对地为自己、为丈夫答辩，表现出出众的勇气和机智。审问者要她“交代”刘少奇的“罪行”，她说：“刘少奇没有罪，叫我交代什么？” 审问者刚说：“三反分子的臭老婆，我们早定你--”，王光美打断他们的话说：“中国的妇女，中国的女共产党员是独立的。”在她就要被带上台去面对几十万人狂呼“打倒”口号、似乎要把她撕成碎片的场面时，审问者问她：“王光美，你怕不怕？”她平静地说：“我怕什么。我不怕。” 她带来了毛巾，牙刷，准备好从这里就進监狱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Decades later, Kuai spoke with admiration about Guang-mei: “She was very strong … She stood straight, and refused to bow her head when ordered to. The students went at her with force, great force. She was pushed down to her knees … but instantly she stood up straight. Wang Guang-mei would not be cowed. She was full of bitterness against Mao Tse-tung, only she could not say it straight out.” Afterwards, she wrote to Mao to protest.</p><p>几十年后，蒯大富带着敬意谈起王光美：“她很坚强。叫她低头她不肯，当时同学一定要叫她低，使力强压，硬按，一下把她压得跪下了。她立刻又爬起来。王光美她是不服气，她那个时候对毛泽东很有意见，但是不敢说。戚本禹的文章她就公开反驳，说我没有讲过那些话，为什么叫我检查，这不是无产阶级革命家所做的事。她还是很坚强的。”事后，王光美给毛泽东写信抗议。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Liu did likewise, again and again. Mao's response was to ratchet up the punishment, leaving detailed instructions with the Small Group before he left Peking on 13 July. The moment he was gone, several hundred thousand Rebels were summoned to camp outside Zhongnanhai, blasting insults like “pile of dog shit” at the Lius through scores of loudspeakers. Liu's subordinates were dragged outside the walls of Zhongnanhai to be denounced in a sort of grotesque road show.</p><p>刘少奇也给毛写信抗议，还不止一次，毛的答覆是惩罚升级。七月十三日，毛离开北京去外地，临走时让戚本禹代理中央办公厅主任，负责整刘少奇等人。毛一走，几十万造反派就奉命在中南海墙外安营扎寨，架设了上百个高音喇叭，日夜不停地冲着中南海内声嘶力竭地咒骂刘少奇，什么“把你这条老狗揪出中南海”，什么“你这不齿于人类的狗屎堆”。刘的下级被人群牵来引去，在墙外轮番批斗。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At the height of this, Liu was presented with a demand to “bow your head obediently and admit your crimes to Chairman Mao.” This was purportedly in the name of some Rebels, to pretend that it had come from “the masses.” But it was presented to Liu by Mao's chamberlain and chief of the Praetorian Guard, Wang Dong-xing, which left no doubt who was the puppeteer. Liu turned the demand down flat. Anticipating the worst after this defiance, Guang-mei held up a bottle of sleeping pills in front of her husband, offering to commit suicide with him. Neither spoke a word for fear of bugging, which would almost certainly have led to the pills being confiscated. Liu shook his head.</p><p>在这场闹剧的高潮中，刘收到“勒令”， 要他写检讨，“老老实实向毛主席低头认罪”。“勒令”表面出自北京某学院的造反派，给人印象好像这是“群众要求”。但通知刘按“勒令”调子写检讨的，却是毛的大总管汪东兴。显而易见，这是毛一手操纵的。刘断然拒绝了毛的要求。王光美拿起安眠药瓶子朝刘晃晃，意思是她愿与刘一同自尽。刘对她摇了摇头。他们俩都没出声，知道有窃听器，怕安眠药被没收。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Knowing how much Liu's strength had come from his wife, Mao ordered the couple separated. On 18 July, they were told they would be denounced at separate meetings that evening. More than three decades later Guang-mei wrote about the moment:</p><p>毛明白刘少奇的勇气很大程度来自他的妻子，下令把两人分开。七月十八日，刘少奇夫妇接到通知，说两人当晚将被分别批斗。他们预感到这将是生离死别，三十多年后，王光美回忆起那一时刻：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I said: “It looks as if it really is goodbye this time!” I just couldn't stop my tears falling …</p><p>此时，我只对他说了一句：“这回真要和你分别了！”就怎么也忍不住，眼泪流了下来……</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> … For the only time in our lives, Shao-chi did my packing for me, and he folded my clothes neatly. In the last few minutes, we sat gazing at each other … Then he who rarely cracked a joke said: “This is like waiting for a sedan-chair to come and carry you off [to be married]!” … We burst out laughing.</p><p>傍晚，我完全平静下来，等着来人揪斗了。少奇生平唯一的一次为我打点行装，拿出我的衣服放好，整整齐齐。在最后的几分钟，我们面对面地坐着……这时，一向不爱说笑的他，却说：倒像是等着上花轿的样子。我也跟着他笑起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After brutal denunciation meetings, the Lius were put in separate virtual solitary confinement. They met again only once, when they were dragged in front of a kangaroo court as a couple, on 5 August, the first anniversary of Mao's written tirade against Liu. Mao's point man Kuai had prepared a big event at Tiananmen Square, where a stage had been specially constructed for the Lius to be paraded in front of an organized crowd of hundreds of thousands. In the end, Mao vetoed the idea. He could not risk this being seen by foreigners. If they were to witness the savagery towards his former closest colleague, here in the heart of Peking, i.e., clearly backed by him, the whole charade could easily backfire. Not least, this could affect foreign Maoists, many of whom had already been alienated by Mao's Purge.* Nor could Mao risk the Lius speaking. Mao could count on the Lius to produce sharp rebuttals, as they had done in letters to himself and in their retorts to Rebels. Mao did not dare risk a Stalin-type show trial. So the Lius ended up receiving their salvo of abuse only inside Zhongnanhai, from Praetorian Guards dressed in mufti and from Zhongnanhai staff.</p><p>批斗会结束后，他们被分开看管。他们最后又见了一面，那是八月五日，毛《炮打司令部》一文问世一周年。蒯大富计划大搞一场批斗会，组织几十万人，“把刘少奇揪到天安门广场，搭一个大平台，把他们抓出来斗。江青支持我们的意见，她把意见整个地原封不动地转给中央。”蒯大富连台子都搭好了。可是毛掂量再三，否决了这个做法。他一直对外国人声称野蛮低劣的批斗方式和语言都是红卫兵搞的。如果出现在天安门广场，外国人无疑会认为这是毛的支使，对他“世界革命领袖”形象将十分不利。外国“毛主义者”们许多已经对毛的大清洗非常反感了。西欧毛派中最老资格的共产党人、比利时的杰克格瑞巴(Jacques Grippa)，自己曾在纳粹集中营里受过刑，知道受折磨的滋味。他写信给刘少奇表示支持。信寄到中南海，被退回来，上面写着：“查无此人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>毛还有一怕，怕刘少奇夫妇开口。迄今的批斗已使他领教了他们锐利的反驳。斯大林在清洗政敌时曾搞过假模假样的公开审判，因为他的政敌事前已乖乖就范。毛不敢对拒绝就范的刘少奇夫妇搞这套把戏。他只得决定在中南海内部由中央警卫团的战士穿着便衣，跟中南海工作人员一道批斗他们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On that day, 5 August, the “capitalist-roaders” Nos. 2 and 3, Deng Xiao-ping and Tao Zhu (Liu was the “No. 1”), were denounced outside their own houses too. They had both fallen into disgrace, like many other old Mao favorites, because they had declined to cooperate with Mao's Great Purge. But as Mao did not hate them as much as he did Liu, they were treated less fiercely. Tao Zhu's wife, Zeng Zhi, was an old friend of Mao's, and was spared. She recounted a telling episode which reveals how precise Mao's control was. While her husband was being beaten up, she was allowed to sit down. A militant woman was about to set upon her when Zeng Zhi noticed a man in the audience shaking his head at the woman, who promptly backed off.</p><p>八月五日那天，中国第二、第三号最大“走资派”邓小平、陶铸，也在中南海自家的院子里同时挨斗。毛要打倒他们，是因为他们不愿同毛合作搞文革。毛仇恨他们的程度远不如像对刘少奇，对他们的批斗也就温和了不少。陶铸夫人曾志是毛早期的朋友，毛对她格外开恩。批斗会上，当她丈夫被揪着“坐喷气式”， 挨打受骂时，她还可以坐着。曾志看见人群里有个女人跳起来要抓她，这时有人朝那女人摇摇头，女人马上就放开了手。曾志明白，这是毛在保她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Zeng Zhi knew that Mao's “friendship” and protection could vanish as soon as she did anything that displeased the Great Helmsman. Later, when her terminally ill husband was sent into internal exile, she was given the option of accompanying him. Both she and her husband knew that if she did so she would lose Mao's goodwill, which would ruin her and their only daughter. So the couple decided she should not go with him, and he died in exile alone.</p><p>她也清楚，毛的保护是有条件的。当患癌症的陶铸被流放外地时，汪东兴问她要不要陪陶铸去。大家都明白，曾志要是去了，就会惹恼毛，她和唯一的女儿也就完了。于是，她和丈夫商量后决定不去。陶铸孤单地死在合肥。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At the kangaroo court inside Zhongnanhai on 5 August 1967, Liu stood his ground and gave succinct answers; but as soon as he tried to say more, Little Red Books rained down on his head, and he was shouted down by the crowd yelling mindless slogans. The Lius were punched, kicked, “jet-planed,” and had their hair pulled ferociously back to expose their faces for photographers and a film crew. At one moment, the meeting was adjourned and an order was given by a Mao point man to make it more ferocious for the cameras. The film shows Liu then being trampled on the ground. </p><p>刘少奇在中南海批斗会上，沉着有条理地对冲着他咆哮的人群進行答辩，但很快就被震耳欲聋的口号声打断，小红书向他劈头盖脸地打去。他和妻子被乱扯乱拉，头发狠狠地揪向后面，让他们扭曲的脸对着照相机和电影摄影机。这些镜头是给毛看的。操纵批斗会的中办代主任戚本禹的秘书，担心斗得不够狠，怕拍到镜头里“气氛不够”一度宣布休会，重新布置。批斗会再开始时，从电影里可以看到，刘少奇被打倒在地，一堆人对他又踩又踢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In a supreme act of sadism, the Lius' six-year-old daughter and their other children were brought to watch their parents being assaulted. The whole vile episode was also attended by Mao's special observer—his own daughter Li Na.</p><p>刘的孩子们，包括六岁的小女儿，被带到会场看父母挨打受辱。毛的女儿李讷也在场，做毛的特别观察员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao may have derived satisfaction from the Lius' ordeal, but he can hardly have failed to register that they were not crushed. At one point, Guang-mei tore free and clung to a corner of her husband's clothes. For a few minutes, under a rain of kicks and punches, the couple held each other's hands tight, struggling to stand up straight.</p><p>毛也许很解气。但他不可能看不出，他打不垮刘少奇夫妇的意志。批斗会上有一刻，王光美突然挣脱扭住她的人，扑到丈夫身边，一把紧紧抓住他的衣角。在拳脚交加下，他们俩挣扎着死死地手拉着手，挺直身子互相对视。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Guang-mei was to pay a hefty price for her courage. A little over a month later, she was charged with spying for America—plus, for good measure, Japan and Chiang Kai-shek. For twelve years, until after Mao's death, she was locked up in the top-security prison, Qincheng, where for long periods she was not allowed even to walk, so that years later she still could not stand up straight. She remained undaunted. Her case team called for her execution. Mao said “No.” He did not want her put out of her misery so soon.</p><p>王光美为她的无畏加倍付出了代价。一个月后，她被正式逮捕，罪名是“美国特务”，外加“国民党特务”和“日本特务”。她在秦城监狱度过了十二个春秋。有相当长时间，她只许坐在铺板上，不许走路，一年半没有放过风，致使她多年腰不能直。专案组建议枪毙她，被毛泽东否决，毛要让王光美生不如死。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Guang-mei's siblings were incarcerated, as was her septuagenarian mother, who died in prison a few years later. The Lius' children became homeless, and were subjected to beatings and imprisonment. One son of Liu's from a previous marriage committed suicide. Meanwhile, Liu's house, a short walk from Mao's, was turned into a uniquely Maoist slow-death cell.</p><p>王光美的亲属也受到牵连。七十多岁的母亲被多次揪斗并关進监狱，几年后死在里面。刘的孩子被赶出家门，有的被批斗，有的被关押，一个被逼得卧轨自杀。至于刘少奇本人，他备受煎熬的囚室，就是他在中南海的住处，离毛的房子不过一箭之遥。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>LIU WAS NEARLY seventy, and his health deteriorated fast. One leg became paralyzed, and he was in a state of permanent sleep deprivation, as the sleeping pills on which he had been dependent were now withheld. He was kept alive, barely. </p><p>刘这时快七十岁了，与妻子诀别后不到几个月，身体就完全垮了。他多年来靠安眠药睡觉，现在药量被大大减少，同时又强迫他改变多年来为了与毛的作息时间同步而形成的白天睡觉夜里工作的习惯，白天不准他睡觉。这使刘永远处于一种无法睡眠、神思恍惚的状态。他多次晕厥，一条腿拖拉着抬不起来，吃饭由卧室到餐厅，二十几公尺远，要走半个小时到四十分钟。吃饭时，手嘴不能配合。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On 20 December 1967, his jailers recorded that they were “only keeping him alive, just short of starvation.” “Tea has been stopped …” His life-threatening ailments, pneumonia and diabetes, were treated, although, in a further Maoist turn of the screw, the doctors would curse him while patching him up. But his mental health was deliberately allowed to collapse. On 19 May 1968, his jailers reported that he “brushed his teeth with a comb and soap, put his socks on over his shoes and his underpants outside his trousers …” And in the cruel style that was the order of the day, they wrote that Liu “plays the idiot, and makes one disgusting fool of himself after another.”</p><p> 一九六七年十二月二十日，有关部门的报告说，原则是让刘半死地活着：“能保证刘吃饱，饿不死就行。”致命的病，像肺炎、糖尿病，给治，医生来诊病时先骂刘一通。对刘神经病变引起的神志不清，大小便失禁等，则听之任之，让病况一天天严重。一九六八年五月十九日的（刘少奇情况反映），用毛泽东时代的典型语言写道：“[刘]装糊涂的事越来越多。比如用梳子、肥皂刷牙，袜子穿在鞋上，短裤穿在长裤外面，有时把两条腿穿在一个裤腿里，装疯卖傻，尽出丑态。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That summer, Mao twice gave orders through Wang Dong-xing to the doctors and the guards that they must “keep him [Liu] alive until after the 9th Congress,” when Mao planned to have Liu expelled from the Party. If Liu was dead, this rigmarole would not provide Mao with the same satisfaction. Once the congress was over, the clear implication was that Liu should be left to die.</p><p>这年夏天，毛两次通过汪东兴对医护、看守人员说，对刘“要把他拖到“九大”， 留个活靶子供批判。”治病不是为了救人，而是为了“保护活证据，向“九大”献礼。” 毛想在“九大”上把刘开除出党。要是那时刘已经不在人世，这幕戏就会失掉光彩。“九大”一过，就可以任“活靶子”死去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By October 1968, Liu had to be drip-fed through the nose, and it seemed he might die any minute. Mao was not ready for the congress, so the Central Committee—in fact, a rump minority which contained only 47 percent of the original members, the rest having been purged—was hastily convened to expel Liu from the Party. It also removed him from the presidency, an act that did not even pretend to follow constitutional procedure.</p><p>到十月，刘少奇已是靠鼻胃管灌食维持生命，随时都可能死亡。开“九大”的时机对毛还不成熟，毛只得匆忙召开了个中央全会，把刘开除出党。“全会”不全，出席者只占中央委员的百分之四十七，其他的都被清洗掉了。全会还撤销了刘的党外职务--国家主席，连“人大”的过场也不走。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Liu's case team had signally failed to come up with a case. Mao had told it he wanted a spy charge, which was a way of avoiding any policy issues, and of steering the investigators away from Liu's links with himself. In fact, Mao was so nervous about Liu speaking to anyone that the team investigating Liu was forbidden even to set eyes on him, let alone ask him any questions. Instead, a large number of other people were imprisoned and interrogated, to try to turn up evidence against him. It was partly to accommodate key detainees in the Liu case that Qincheng, the prison for the “elite,” which had been built with the help of Russian advisers in the 1950s, was expanded by 50 percent. Its first inmate in the Cultural Revolution was Shi Zhe, who had interpreted for Liu with Stalin and who was pressed to say that Liu was a Russian spy. Also imprisoned here was the American Sidney Rittenberg, who had known Mme Liu in the 1940s. Pressure was put on him to say that he had recruited her, and Liu, for American intelligence. (Rittenberg observed that the interrogators, while going through the required frenzied motions, did not seem to believe their own case.) Attempts were also made to get former Nationalist intelligence chiefs to say that Guang-mei had spied for them.</p><p>毛给刘定罪的调子是把刘打成“特务”。这样既可以置刘于死地，又避免涉及到毛。毛怕人向刘提问，怕刘开口回答问题，连刘的专案组也不许审讯刘，甚至见刘也不准。这在办案上恐怕还是件新鲜事。为了找“罪证”，专案组大肆抓人，五十年代由苏联设计的“中国第一政治监狱”秦城，在文革初期扩建一倍半，关的不少是跟刘有关的人。一九六六年第一名囚犯，代号“六六0一”， 就是曾在刘少奇与斯大林之间做过翻译的师哲，逼他交代的问题有“斯大林是怎样发展刘少奇当特务的？”同时关在这里的还有美国人李敦白，四十年代他与王光美有过一面之交，现在逼他承认是他把王光美，甚至刘少奇，发展为美国情报部门的特务。李敦白看得出来，审讯他的人尽管歇斯底里地叫喊，自己也不相信这一指控。被关押的国民党特务头子沈醉也反覆被审，要他说王光美是军统特务。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Most of those detained and called upon to tell blatant lies tried their hardest not to comply. Among those who paid dearly for sticking to their guns were two former Party chiefs, Li Li-san and Lo Fu. Their families were thrown into prison, and the two men themselves were both to meet their deaths. Li-san's Russian wife, who had stood by him through the purges in Russia in the 1930s when he had been imprisoned there for two years, now spent eight years in Mao's prison.</p><p>被审的人大都尽了最大努力不撒谎。坚持说真话的人中有两位是前中共领导李立三、张闻天。为此，他们和家庭都遭到监禁，两人也过早地辞世。李立三夫人李莎是俄罗斯人，三十年代李立三在苏联大肃反中坐牢时，曾共过患难。这位为爱情付出巨大牺牲的女性，如今在毛泽东的铁窗后度过了漫长的八年。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even some of the members of the Lius' case team declined to fabricate evidence. As a result, the team itself had to be purged three times, and two of its three chiefs ended up in prison. It found itself in a Catch-22 situation, as concocting evidence could be as dangerous as failing to unearth it. On one occasion, the team claimed that Liu had wanted American troops to invade China in 1946, and that Liu had wanted to see President Truman about this. “Making such a claim,” Mao said, “is … to treat us like fools. America sending in troops en masse: even the Nationalists did not want that.” In the end, the team just piled up a list of assertions, one being that Liu “married the American spy Wang Guang-mei who had been sent to Yenan by the American Strategic Intelligence.” Its report, which was delivered to the Central Committee by Mao's faithful slave, Chou En-lai, called Liu a “traitor, enemy agent and scab,” and recommended the death sentence. But Mao rejected it, as he did for Mme Liu.</p><p>刘少奇专案组的成员也有不愿造假证据的，专案组因此三次换人，两名负责人锒铛入狱。当然，捏造证据跟拿不出证据一样危险。毛在一九六八年五月八日说：“整出来的刘少奇的材料，也不能全信。比如说他一九四六年冬季和美国勾结，组织反共同盟军，要美国大规模出兵打共产党，并且要沈其震经过司徒雷登介绍去见杜鲁门、艾奇逊。有的材料是故弄玄虚，是骗我们的，耍我们的。美国大批出兵，当时国民党都还不愿意呢。”最后专案组只好罗列一串莫须有的罪名，说刘少奇是“叛徒、内奸、工贼”。这份《审查报告》由周恩来在中央全会上宣读。专案组曾建议对刘处以极刑，毛不同意。要刘死他有别的法子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao was kept fully informed about Liu's last sufferings. Photographs were taken showing Liu in such agony that he had squeezed two hard plastic bottles right out of shape. In April 1969, when the 9th Congress convened at last, Mao announced in a voice devoid of even a show of pity, that Liu was at death's door.</p><p>刘死前的痛苦毛一清二楚。不仅有呈送给他的报告，还有为他拍摄的照片。从其中两张可以看到，刘在极度难受中紧紧握住两个硬塑胶瓶子，瓶子被他揑得变了形，成了两个“小葫芦”。“九大”开幕时，毛用完全无动于衷，连假慈悲也不屑于装的声音宣布：刘快死了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In his lucid hours, Liu had maintained his dignity. On 11 February 1968 he had written a last self-defense, in which he even had a go at Mao about his dictatorial style from back in the early 1920s. After that, Liu went totally silent. Mao's whole modus operandi depended on breaking people, but he had failed to make Liu crawl.</p><p>刘少奇到死也保持着尊严。一九六八年二月十一日，他曾为自己写了最后一份答辩，中间提到毛早年就是个专制者，二十年代初期他在毛那里开会时就“根本无法发言，最后，总是照毛主席的意见办理。”为了这些话，江青等人气急败坏，批示说刘“恶毒的攻击了伟大领袖毛主席”，“反革命放毒要批臭”等等。任这些人去暴跳如雷，刘少奇从此一个字不写，一句话不说，用沉默表示他独特的抗议。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On a cold October night, half-naked under a quilt, Liu was put on a plane to the city of Kaifeng. There, local doctors' requests for an X-ray or hospitalization were denied. Death came within weeks, on 12 November 1969. Altogether, Liu had endured three years of physical suffering and mental anguish. He was cremated under a pseudonym, his face wrapped in white cloth. The crematorium staff had been told to vacate the premises, on the grounds that the corpse had a deadly infectious disease.</p><p>一九六九年十月一个寒冷的夜晚，刘在一床被子下，半裸着身体，被抬上飞机送往开封。当地医生要求给刘透视诊病，上面不准。在刘病危时要求送医院或会诊抢救，也被拒绝。死亡在十一月十二日到来。在一个夜深人静的时刻，刘的尸体被秘密运往火葬场火化，脸用白布包着。火葬场的人接到通知说死者患有急性传染病，要他们全部离开，只留两名工人看炉点火。火葬单上填的是假名字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The extraordinary coda to Liu's story is that his death was never made public during Mao's lifetime. This seemingly anomalous behavior (most dictators like to dance on their enemies' graves) was an indication of how insecure Mao felt. He was afraid that if the news got out, it would arouse sympathy for the dead man. In fact, the vilification of Liu continued for the rest of Mao's life, with never a hint to the public that Liu was dead. Mao had got his revenge by making Liu die a painful and lingering death. But it cannot have tasted very sweet.</p><p>刘少奇的死极端保密，毛直到咽气也没敢对中国人民公布。权势熏天的人在除掉政敌后往往喜欢张扬庆祝。毛却怕人知道，怕刘的死讯传出会激起人们对刘的同情。刘死后的这些年，毛不断在媒体上批刘，给人印象刘还活着。毛虽然报了仇，但心虚已极。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>NOR DID MAO emerge a victor vis-à-vis his second-biggest hate, Marshal Peng De-huai. The first Rebel leader sent to Sichuan in December 1966 to haul Peng back to detention in Peking was so moved by Peng after he talked to him that he started to appeal on Peng's behalf. The Rebel ended up in prison, but said he had no regrets for having stuck his neck out. Another Rebel leader who manhandled Peng expressed deep remorse later for what he had done. There is no question where people's feelings lay when they knew what Peng stood for, or met him.</p><p>除了刘，毛最恨的人要数彭德怀了。毛让他也吃够了苫头，结果是同样的不能令他称心如意。文革开始后，毛派北京地质学院造反派到四川把彭抓来北京。造反派领袖朱成昭，在回京的火车上同彭德怀长谈，彭把庐山会议的大致情况讲给他听他幡然醒悟，佩服彭德怀，不仅一路保护彭，回北京后还给毛写信，说整彭整错了。信寄出后，朱成昭从几十万人的指挥转眼变成阶下囚。牢狱多年，他仍不后悔。另外一个造反派首领，北京航空学院的韩爱晶，在批斗彭时打过彭。后来韩对自己的行为非常后悔。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In Peking, Peng was dragged to scores of denunciation meetings, on Mao's orders, at each one of which he was kicked by Rebels wearing heavy leather boots and beaten ferociously with staves. His ribs were broken, and he passed out repeatedly.</p><p>在北京，彭被几十个单位轮番批斗，被大皮鞋当胸踢，被木棍打断骨头，在批斗台上昏过去、醒过来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Unlike Liu, Peng was interrogated, some 260 times, as Mao genuinely feared he might have had some connection with Khrushchev. In solitary, Peng's mind began to crack, but his redoubtable core never did. He wrote a lucid account of his life, refuting Mao's accusations. The ending, written in September 1970, proclaimed: “I will still lift my head and shout a hundred times: my conscience is clear!”</p><p>由于毛怀疑他曾跟赫鲁晓夫商讨过倒毛，他被提审二百六十余次，最后精神出现错乱。在监狱里，他写下一生的经历，对毛的指控做出坚决的反驳。一九七0年九月完成的自述结尾写道：“我仍然挺起胸脯，大喊百声，问心无愧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Peng was a man of rugged constitution, and his ordeal lasted even longer than Liu's—eight years, until 29 November 1974, when he was finally felled by cancer of the rectum. Like Liu, he was cremated under a pseudonym, and his death, too, was never announced while Mao remained alive.</p><p>彭体魄强壮，他受的磨难也就比刘少奇长久 -- 一直持续了八年，直到一九七四年十一月二十九日，他终于倒在直肠癌下。像刘一样，他的火化也在极端保密的状况下進行，用的是假名字。像刘一样，他的死在毛生前也没有敢公布。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>*The Belgian Communist Jacques Grippa, the most senior Maoist in Western Europe and a man who had himself been tortured in a Nazi camp, now wrote to Liu, as president, in Zhongnanhai. The letter was returned marked “Does not live at this address.”</p><p></p></div>
