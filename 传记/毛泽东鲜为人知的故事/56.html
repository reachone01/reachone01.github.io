<div class='layout'><p> 56 MME MAO IN THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION</p><p>56 江青在文革中</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> (1966–75   AGE 72–81)</p><p>1966～1975 年    72～81 岁</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MAO'S LAST WIFE, Jiang Qing, is often thought of as the evil woman who manipulated Mao. Evil she was, but she never originated policy, and she was always Mao's obedient servant, from the time of their marriage in 1938. Their relationship was aptly described by herself after Mao died: “I was Chairman Mao's dog. Whoever Chairman Mao asked me to bite, I bit.” In the first few years of the Great Purge, she headed the Small Group, Mao's office that dealt with the Purge, and afterwards she was a member of the Politburo. In these posts, she played a big part in ruining the lives of tens of millions of people. She also helped Mao to destroy Chinese culture and keep China a cultural desert.</p><p>江青至今被说成是文革的罪魁祸首，是蒙蔽毛的邪恶女人。其实，中国的任何政策，都不是她制定的，她执行毛的意志，她在毛死后这样形容自己：“我是主席的一条狗，主席叫我咬谁我就晈谁。”她先为毛执掌中央文革小组，后任政治局委员。文革浩劫，她有一份责任。她是毛毁灭中华文化的主要帮凶。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The only individual initiative that she took in the Purge was to use her position to engage in personal vendettas. One was against an actress called Wang Ying, who decades before had won a theatrical role Mme Mao herself had coveted, and who then spent glamorous years in America, even performing in the White House for the Roosevelts. Wang Ying died in prison.</p><p>她利用文革为自己干了不少坏事。受害者之一是演员王莹。几十年前，王莹主演了一个江青想扮演的戏剧角色，以后又同丈夫双双赴美，在白宫为罗斯福总统夫妇演出，大出风头。王莹死在狱中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mme Mao had one vulnerable spot, her Shanghai past. She lived in constant dread that her scandals, and her behavior in prison under the Nationalists, would be exposed. So former colleagues, friends, a lover, lovers' friends, and even a maid who had been devoted to her, were thrown into prison, many of them never to emerge alive.</p><p>江青有一怕，怕她年轻时在上海的绯闻，以及在国民党监狱里不清不白的事暴露出来。她把早年的同事、朋友、情人，乃至对她忠心耿耿的保姆，都投入监狱，有的就死在里面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Another obsession was to retrieve a letter she had once written after a row with Mao, back in 1958. In a fit of frenzy she had dashed off a letter to an old friend, a film director, asking for the address of a former husband, Tang Na, who was living in Paris. The potentially fatal consequences of this rash act had been nagging at her ever since. Eight years later, as soon as she had the power, she had the hapless film director and several other former mutual friends arrested and their houses ransacked. The director died from torture, pleading in vain that he had destroyed her letter.</p><p>一九五八年，由于毛发表了一首思念前妻杨开慧的词，江青和毛大吵一架。气头上她给电影导演郑君里写信，问前夫唐纳在巴黎的地址。这一轻率举动，多年来一直是江青的心病。文革有了权，她马上把郑君里和别的几个朋友抓起来，把他们的家翻了个底朝天，搜寻那封信。郑君里说信早已烧掉了，但江青不信，把他在狱中折磨至死。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With so much blood on her hands, Mme Mao was haunted by the specter of assassins. At the peak of her power, she developed an intense fear of strangers coming near her, as well as of unexpected sounds, just as Mao had on the eve of conquering China. When a new secretary joined her staff in 1967, his predecessor greeted him by saying: “Comrade Jiang Qing is not very well … She is particularly afraid of sounds, and of strangers. As soon as she hears a noise or sees a stranger, she … starts to sweat and flies into a temper. Whatever we do in this building—talking, walking, opening and closing windows and doors—we must take special care to be noiseless. Please do be very, very careful. Don't see her for a while, and try your best to stay out of her way. If the worst comes to the worst and you can't hide, don't try to run …”</p><p> 当江青的权力达到顶峰时，就像毛在征服中国的前夕见到生人会发抖一样，她也产生了对生人的恐惧。她的秘书杨银禄记录了一九六七年上任时前任对他说的话：江青“特别怕声音，还怕见生人，一听到声音，见到生人，就精神紧张，出虚汗，发脾气。”“你在短时间之内先别见她，尽量躲着她，如果实在躲不开，你也不能跑，一跑就坏了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her nurse also advised the new secretary that “she is particularly frightened of seeing strangers. If she sets eyes on you now, there will be big trouble.” For more than three months, the secretary lurked in his office. Then his predecessor left—in fact for prison. Next day, the new man was summoned: </p><p>杨秘书在屋里憋了整整二十四小时。当他小心翼翼地走出办公室时，江青的护士走过来，轻声要他马上回去，解释说江青快要起床了，她特别怕见生人，如果你现在被她看见就麻烦了。”杨在钓鱼台十一号楼待了三个多月，成天躲在办公室里。前任走后(進了监狱)，一天，江青打钤叫秘书。杨写道：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I went into her office trembling with fear. I saw her reclining on a sofa, with her feet on a soft footstool, reading some documents in a languid manner.” After a few exchanges, “She raised her head, opened her eyes, and fixed me with a peevish, dissatisfied stare. She said: ‘You can't talk to me standing. When you talk to me, your head can't be higher than mine. I am sitting, so you should crouch down and talk to me. Didn't they even tell you this rule?' … So I crouched down …”</p><p>我胆战心惊地走進她的办公室。一進门，我看到她仰坐在沙发上，两脚和小腿搭在一个软脚垫上，在那里懒洋洋地看文件。她听到我進入她的办公室，臃肿的眼皮，都没抬一下，就问道：“你就是杨银禄同志吧？来了一段时间了吧？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After the secretary answered one or two of her questions, Mme Mao snapped: “ ‘… You speak so loud, so fast, it's like firing a machine-gun. It gives me a headache, and makes me sweat. If I fall ill because of your carelessness about the volume and rate of your speech, your responsibility will be too gigantic.' She pointed at her forehead and said in a loud voice: ‘Look, you look, I'm sweating!'</p><p>“是，我叫杨银禄，已经来了三个多月了。”我的心情虽然紧张，但还是以在部队时的习惯，干脆俐落地回答了江青的提问。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I lowered my voice and said: ‘Please forgive me. I will take care with my voice and speed.'</p><p>几句问答后，“这时，她抬起头，睁大眼睛瞪了我几眼，不高兴、不满意地说：“你不能站着跟我说话。你跟我说话的时候，你的头不能高于我的头。我坐着，你就应该蹲下来跟我说话。这点规矩他们没有告诉你？””</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Jiang Qing knitted her eyebrows … and shrieked loudly and impatiently: ‘What are you saying? I can't hear you. Now your voice is too low. If I can't hear you clearly, I will also become tense, and will also sweat …' ” The secretary was waved away.</p><p>当秘书按照江青的规矩蹲在她的右前方一公尺处，和她说话时，江青又发了一顿无名火：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>江青……很生气地说：“我今天原谅你，因为你刚来，还不了解我的习惯。以后，不允许你那样跟我说话。你说话的声音那样高，速度那样快，像放机关枪似的，使我感到头疼，使得我出汗。如果由于你说话不注意音量和音频，把我搞病了，你的责任可就大了。”说着，就指了指她的额头，大声说：“你看，你看呀，我都出汗了！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>这时，我有意压低声音说：“请你原谅，我今后一定要注意说话的声音和速度。” 江青皱着眉头，拉着长音，大声而不耐烦地问道：“你在说什么？我怎么没听清楚，你说话的声音又太小了。如果我听不清你说的是什么，心情也会紧张，也会着急出汗，你懂吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>她没有等我再说什么，就急忙说：“好好好。”摆手叫我赶快出去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Life at close quarters with Mme Mao was a nightmare, as everyone around her whom we interviewed testified. She would send servants to jail at the drop of a hat for phantom crimes. When Chou En-lai went to her place, his entourage preferred to sit in their cars and freeze rather than go into her villa, in case they bumped into her, which could land them in disaster. Chou's chief bodyguard, Cheng Yuan-gong, was in charge of security at a meeting she was coming to in 1968. Her staff asked him to have some food ready, so he invited her to eat first. He described what happened next: “She burst in on the premier and said: ‘Cheng Yuan-gong wanted to stop me from coming in. What's going on here? What sort of meeting are you having?' She yelled and screamed at the premier.” Chou had to spend hours straightening things out. Two days later she told Chou: “Cheng Yuan-gong is a scoundrel. He had a shady past. And he has always been trying to prevent me from seeing the premier …” The bodyguard had been with Chou for twenty-three years, but Chou had to get rid of him, and the man was packed off to detention, and then to a camp.</p><p>江青随时可能以莫须有的罪名把一个人送進监狱。周恩来到她那里去开会，他的随从宁可坐在冰天雪地下的车里挨冻，也不愿進她的楼里取暖，怕被她撞见祸从天降。有一次，周的卫士长成元功负责一个会议的安全保卫，江青的警卫员事先给他打电话，说江青刚起床，没有吃饭，要他准备点吃的。江青到了，成元功请她先吃饭。成回忆道：“她看了我一眼，就走了。進了会场，她找到总理，说：“成元功挡在门口不让我進，你们在搞什么，开什么会？”她跟总理大吵大闹一个多小时。” 周对她解释了又解释，把她的警卫员召来对证，她仍不依不饶，骂：“成元功，你是一条狗。”两天后又对周说：“成元功从历史上就是个坏人，长期以来限制我跟总理接触，不让我见总理。”周恩来只得把跟了他二十三年的卫士长从身边赶走，成進了准劳改营：“五七干校”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao knew what a monumental, time-consuming pain his wife was, as some people occasionally grumbled to him; and he knew that her behavior interfered with the smooth functioning of his regime. But for him it was worth it to keep everybody off balance and maintain a climate of insecurity and capriciousness, and to keep things on the paranoid track. With Mao himself, of course, she was as meek and quiet as a mouse. She feared him. Only he could do her harm.</p><p>毛不担心江青的耍泼胡闹不得人心，他就是要用她在中共高层制造一种人人提心吊胆，朝不保夕的气氛。在毛面前，江温顺得像只小猫，只有毛能够带给她灾难。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>IN 1969, WHEN Mao's reconstructed regime was set up, Mao wound up the Small Group, keeping Mme Mao on as his attack dog. She had no administrative role. While on standby for Mao, she spent a lot of time playing cards, amusing herself with her pets, including a monkey (when pets were banned for everyone else), and riding in Beihai Park in the center of Peking, formerly a public park, now closed to the public. She watched foreign films practically every night—all, naturally, prohibited for ordinary Chinese.</p><p>一九六九年“中央文革”解散后，江青没有具体的行政职务，有了闲工夫。她打牌、骑马、养宠物，甚至还养了只猴子。北京市中心的北海公园自文革以来对老百姓关了门，是她遛马的地方。她差不多每天晚上都要看外国影片，那也是几个人的特权。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her lifestyle was the acme of extravagance. One of her hobbies was photography. For this she would get warships to cruise up and down, and anti-aircraft guns to fire salvos. Her swimming pools had to be kept permanently heated, and for one of them built exclusively for her, in Canton, mineral water was channeled from dozens of kilometers away. Roads were built specially for her to scenic mountain spots, often requiring extraordinary means. In one case, because her villa was nearby, the army engineers building the road were forbidden to use dynamite in case the explosions alarmed her, and they had to break the rocks manually. Planes were kept on tap for her every whim, even to fly a particular jacket that she suddenly felt like wearing from Peking to Canton, or a favorite chaise longue. Her special train, like Mao's, would stop at will, snarling up the transport system. Far from feeling ashamed, she would say: “In order for me to have a good rest, and a good time, it is worth sacrificing some other people's interests.”</p><p>江青的生活方式极端奢侈。她爱好摄影，于是军舰在海上游弋，高射炮对空发射，博得她哈哈大笑地说：“真过瘾，今天我可抢拍了好镜头。”广州一个专为她修的游泳池，用的是几十公里外运来的矿泉水。路为她新辟，使她得以舒适地游山玩水。开路不那么容易。有的离她住处不远，工程兵不准用炸药，怕响声吓着她，只好用火烧、水激等办法来砸开石头。她一时心血来潮，可以叫专机把一件大衣从北京送到广州，也可以叫空军的大型运输机把一张卧从青岛运来北京。她的专列，像毛的一样，随时想走就走，想停就停，客货列车都要让路，运营计划也要打乱。江青非但不感到惭愧，反而说：“为了我休息好，玩得愉快，牺牲一些别人的利益是值得的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One such sacrifice was blood. Always on the lookout for methods to improve her health and looks, she learned about an unusual technique: blood transfusions from healthy young men. So scores of Praetorian Guards were put through a rigorous health check, and from a short list of four, blood was taken from two of them for her. Afterwards, she gave the two a dinner, telling them what a “glorious” deed they had done to “donate” their blood to her. “When you know your blood is circulating inside me … you must feel very proud,” she added—before warning them to keep their mouths shut. </p><p>“别人的利益”包括鲜血。江青总是在寻找养生驻容之道，林彪夫人叶群告诉她，有一个诀窍是输年轻人的血。于是中央警卫团挑了几十个警卫战士，检查身体后选了四个人，再从中间挑了两个把血输给江青。输完血后，江青请他们吃饭，对他们说：“你们为我输了血，你们的血和我的血同时在我的体内流动，你们一定会感到很自豪的吧？”接着便告诫他们：“为我输血的事，你们不要到外边去说了，你们要知道，中央领导人的身体情况是严格保密的，你们就当个无名英雄好了。甘当无名英雄也是光荣的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The transfusions did not become a routine, as she got so excited that she told Mao about them, and he advised against them on health grounds.</p><p>兴奋之余，江青报告了丈夫。毛反对说：“身体没有大的毛病，输血是不适宜的。” 她这才作罢。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In spite of her constant complaining, Mme Mao was in fact in very good health. But she was a nervous wreck. She had to down three lots of sleeping pills before she could drop off, which was usually about 4:00 AM, and she also took tranquillizers twice a day. When she was indoors in daytime, she had natural light shut out, just as Mao did, by three layers of curtains, and read by a lamp, with a black cloth draped over the shade, producing an atmosphere her secretary described as spooky.</p><p>江青的身体没什么问题，有问题的是她畸形的神经。她每天要吃三次安眠药才能在凌晨四点左右睡觉，日间也要吃两次镇静剂。白天在室内，三层窗帘全部拉得紧紧的，让阳光一丁点也透不進去。落地灯打开，灯罩上却盖着一块黑布。秘书说：“我们要是一个人在她的室内工作，还真有点害怕”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Noise bothered her to an absurd degree. In her main residence in Peking, the Imperial Fishing Villa, staff were ordered to drive away birds and cicadas—and even, at times, not to wear shoes, and to walk with their arms aloft and legs apart, to prevent their clothes from rustling. </p><p>她怕声音怕到了荒谬的地步。连细雨声，风吹草动声，鸟唱蝉鸣声，她都反感，并且叫嚷：“声音太大啦，受不了啦！”有时捂着耳朵，闭着眼睛，紧锁眉头，摇晃着脑袋，命令工作人员轰鸟、赶蝉、打树叶、砍竹子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even though her villa sat in a garden of 420,000 square meters, she ordered the park next door, Yuyuantan, one of the few public parks left in the capital, closed down. A similar thing happened in Canton, where her villa lay beside the Pearl River, so traffic on this commercially important thoroughfare was suspended during her stays, and even a distant shipyard had to stop work.</p><p>怕声音怕得最厉害的时候，工作人员走路时不准穿鞋，两条腿叉开，两只胳膊抬起来，以免发出摩擦声。工作人员在她旁边时，不准大声呼吸；嗓子痒了，也不准咳嗽。她住在北京的钓鱼台，这是一个有四十二万平方公尺的大庭园，她住的楼在园子中心。可她还抱怨说不安静，把隔壁的玉渊潭公园--北京仅有的几个对老百姓开放的公园之一 -- 也关闭了。广州的别墅“小岛”坐落在珠江畔，江青一驾到，附近的水路交通便停运，远处的一个船厂也停了工。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Heat and drafts also obsessed her. Her rooms had to be kept at exactly 21.5 degrees centigrade in winter, and 26 degrees in summer. But even when the thermostat showed that the temperature was exactly what she demanded, she would accuse her attendants: “You falsify temperature! You conspire to harm me!” Once she threw a big pair of scissors at a nurse, missing her by inches, because the nurse could not locate the source of a draft.</p><p>江青的房间温度冬天必须保持摄氏二十一点五度，夏天二十六度。她觉得温度不对时，哪怕温度表指到她要求的度数上也无济于事，她会破口大骂：“你们在你们的后台指示下，在温度表上弄虚作假。”“你们合伙来对付我，有意伤害我！”有一次，她说她房子里“有风”，护士无论如何找不到风源，她就抄起一把大剪刀狠狠地向护士扔去，护士躲闪得快才没有受伤。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“To serve me is to serve the people” was her constant refrain to her staff.</p><p>“为我服务就是为人民服务”-- 江青常常这样告诫身边工作人员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>AFTER LIN BIAO crashed to his death, and the assassination plot against Mao—and herself—surfaced in late 1971, Mme Mao became plagued by nightmares about the Lins' ghosts pursuing her. She confided to her secretary: “I have been feeling as if I am about to die any minute … as if some catastrophe is about to happen tomorrow. I feel full of terror all the time.”</p><p>一九七一年“九·一三”后，林立果暗杀毛和攻打钓鱼台的密谋曝光，江青常常做噩梦，有一次梦见林彪夫妇烧焦的尸体追赶她。她惶惶不可终日，对人说：“我总感到我快死了，活不了多久了，好像明天就会大祸临头了。老是有一种恐惧感。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her paranoia had been flipped into overdrive by an incident that occurred just before the Lins fled. She had gone to Qingdao to photograph warships (she had ordered six of them to roam about at sea to pick the best angle), and found the lavatory in the local villa wanting. So she used a spittoon instead, which, she complained, was too hard for her bottom. So her staff rigged up a seat for it, using a rubber ring from the swimming pool. She had to be supported by her nurses while she relieved herself, but she was accustomed to this. One night, however, she used the spittoon-toilet without assistance after taking three lots of sleeping pills, and fell and broke her collarbone. After the Lins fled, she insisted that this accident had been part of the assassination plot, and that her sleeping pills had been poisoned. This caused a huge commotion, with all her medicines sealed up and carted away to be tested, and her entire medical staff detained and interrogated in front of Chou En-lai and the Politburo. Chou had to talk to her for a whole night, from 9:00 PM to 7:00 AM, trying to calm her down.</p><p> 林彪出逃前，江青曾到青岛避暑，让六艘大军舰在海上转来转去供她拍照。她玩儿得很高兴，只是不满当地的厕所。坐在痰盂上大小便，又说硌得屁股疼。 于是工作人员先用充了气的游泳圈垫在痰盂上，后又做了个便凳，周围靠上软沙发，权作临时马桶，江青由护士搀扶着大小便。一天夜里她自己起来小便，由于吃了三次安眠药，她迷迷糊糊坐不稳摔倒了，折断了锁骨。林彪出逃后，江青硬说这桩事故是林彪谋杀她的阴谋的一部分，说是她的安眠药里有“内奸和特务”放的毒。她闹得天翻地覆，把所有的药封存起来，拿去化验，把医护人员关在一间屋子里，由警卫员看守，然后一一带到周恩来和政治局委员面前受审。周恩来从晚上九点一直陪她说话到凌晨七点，好歹让她安定了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Nixons' visit in February 1972 came as an enormous tonic. With them and with the subsequent stream of international visitors, she could indulge her craving to play the First Lady. There was also the chance to publicize herself to the world by having her biography written. In August that year, an American woman academic, Roxane Witke, was invited to write about her and hopefully turn her into a global celebrity, as Edgar Snow had done for Mao.</p><p>尼克松伉俪一九七二年二月的访问对江青好似一剂兴奋剂，她终于可以扮演中国第一夫人的角色了。随着各国政要的接踵而至，江青期望受到全世界的瞩目，想找个外国人来写她的传记，像当年斯诺写毛泽东一样。那年八月，美国女学者维特克(Roxane Witke)受邀前来采访她、写她。江青同维特克谈了六十个小时。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mme Mao talked to Witke for sixty hours. But her performance annoyed Mao, who had originally endorsed the project. True to form, she shot her mouth off. To the horror of her entourage, she confessed to a deep “love” and nostalgia for Shanghai in pre-Communist days, and even hummed to Witke a flirtatious song popular there in the 1930s. “My life was extremely romantic then … I had so many boyfriends, suitors who chased after me …” This was bad enough, but she nearly caused heart failure in the Chinese present by describing how an American marine had once tried to pick her up. “Perhaps he was drunk. He was staggering towards me along the Bund in Shanghai, and stood in front of me. He barred my way, clicked his heels and gave me a military salute … He put out his arms … I raised my hand and slapped him. He went on smiling, and gave me another salute, clicking his heels. He even said ‘Sorry.' You Americans are so polite …”</p><p>毛最初批准了这一做法，但江青的口无遮拦又让他生气。据陪同她的外交官张颖记载，江对维特克说：“你不是想了解我个人的生活吗？哈哈，你别看我现在领导着全国文化大革命，从前呀，我年轻的时候，可是富于感情，我个人的生活是非常罗曼蒂克的。”“我最喜欢上海，你们外国人说是冒险家的乐园，有点道理，上海的小调我都喜欢。那真是非常有味道，我还唱哩，背给你听听……”接着江青细声细气地哼起了上海小调：“我呀我的小妹妹哩，舍也舍不得离……咿呵呀呵唉……”，接着咯咯笑道：“我一到上海呀，男朋友可多去了。喏，就是追逐我的人，我都可以数出名字来，他们还使用各种手段哩。以后都成了知名人士，现在又被打倒啦，哈哈……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>在场的中国陪同人员你看我我看你，不知江青还要说出些什么“大逆不道”的东西。江青越说越来劲：“有趣的一次，是你们美国人，是一个水兵，也许是喝醉酒了，摇摇摆摆在上海外滩走着，向我迎面走来，他站在我面前，挡住我的路，向我敬了一个军礼：两脚一并，喀嚓一声。我回头想走开，那家伙嬉皮笑脸向我走近来，双手也伸过来了，哼，想占便宜！我抬手就给他一巴掌。他还是笑嘻嘻，又是喀嚓一声，敬了个军礼，还说对不起呢。你们美国人，还是懂礼貌的……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mme Mao gushed that she “worshipped” Greta Garbo, and adored Gone with the Wind, which she said she had watched some ten times: “Each time I was very moved.” “Can China produce a film like this?” she asked, as though she and her husband had nothing to do with the suppression of Chinese cinema. Her adulation of Gone with the Wind seems to have made Mao's press controller Yao Wen-yuan uneasy, as he started spouting Party clichés: “… the film has shortcomings. She [the writer] sympathized with slave-owners.” Mme Mao shut him up with a baffling observation: “But I didn't see any praise in the film for the Ku Klux Klan.”</p><p>江青滔滔不绝地说她如何崇拜美国明星嘉宝(Greta Garbo)， 如何热爱好莱坞电影《飘》 (Gone With the Wind)，说她“看过大概有十遍了，每看一遍都很感动”， 还不屑地反问道：“中国能拍出这样的电影吗？” -- 好像中国电影的凋萎跟她和她丈夫都毫无关系。江青这样歌颂《飘》，让毛的新闻总管姚文元有点不安，姚轻轻地插了一句：“从历史观点来看，内容是有缺点的。她[作者]同情奴隶主。”江青的回答有点令人摸不着头脑：“我没有看到电影中赞扬三K党(Ku Klux Klan)。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the end, on Mao's orders, only some transcripts were shipped to Witke, who published a full-length biography. </p><p>最后，按毛的意思，江青谈话的记录只有一部分给了维特克·维女士后来出版了一本江青传。其他纪录稿全部放進保险箱，上锁加封条，進了外交部保密室。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Jiang Qing continued to play the First Lady with foreigners, though her chances to do so were far fewer than she would have liked. As a result, she constantly tried to shoehorn her way in. When Danish prime minister Poul Hartling came in 1974, she accompanied him and his wife to a show, but was not included in the state banquet, so she barged in just beforehand and detained the Danes for half an hour, keeping 400 people waiting. She talked in what seemed to the Hartlings a “haughty” and “show-off” manner, and was embarrassing. When an American swimming team came, she lurked around the corner of a glass wall to eye them practising. “Oh, they were so beautiful!… such beautiful movements,” she enthused afterwards. (She herself had earlier declined to take to the water with Witke on the grounds that “the masses would become too excited” if they saw their “First Lady” swimming.)</p><p>毛没有因此禁止江青在外国人面前露面，但露面的机会远不如她渴望的那么多。丹麦首相哈特林(Poul Hartling)一九七四年访华，江青陪同他和夫人观看演出，但国宴没有她的份儿。不甘心的她，就在国宴开始前赶去，把哈特林夫妇留住，高谈阔论，让四百名出席宴会的人等了半个多小时。哈特林夫妇感到她的举止“傲慢”、“卖弄”， 他们为她感到难堪。美国游泳队来访时，没有安排她接见，她就偷偷在游泳池的玻璃墙外看他们练习，事后一叠声叹息说：“真是美呀！……游得真好，姿势很美，速度又快……”江青本人在维特克面前谢绝下水，理由是：要是“群众”看见她游泳，“会过度激动”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MME MAO'S THIRST for contact with foreigners was matched only by her yearning for feminine clothes. In her husband's China, women were only allowed shapeless jackets and trousers. Only on extremely rare occasions could she wear a dress or a skirt. In 1972, she longed to wear a dress to accompany the US president (who described her as “unpleasantly abrasive and aggressive”) and Mrs. Nixon to the ballet The Red Detachment of Women, one of her eight “model shows.” But after much agonizing, she abandoned the idea, since it would look too incongruous in front of large numbers of Chinese in the audience who, though specially invited, would all be wearing drab Mao-issue clothes. When Imelda Marcos of the Philippines visited China in September 1974 in her glorious national costume, Mme Mao had to appear in her shapeless uniform and cap, which showed her up most unfavorably next to the former beauty queen. Both the Chinese photographer and Mrs. Marcos noticed that she kept staring at Mrs. Marcos enviously out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>除了热望接触外国人，江青渴求的还有女性化的服装。在她丈夫统治下的中国，女人只有臃肿难看的衣裤可穿，江青也受到限制，只能在个别场合穿裙子。尼克松访华时，在总统眼中“粗鲁、好斗”的江青，陪总统夫妇看“样板戏” 《红色娘子军》。她为那天穿什么衣服煞费苦心，非常想穿件连衣裙，又怕在人民大会堂的众目睽睽下太显眼，最后忍痛放弃了这个念头。菲律宾的第一夫人伊梅尔达·马科斯(Imelda Marcos)穿着华丽的菲律宾国服来访，江青却只有毛式服装加军帽，与这位从前的“菲律宾小姐”相形见绌。马科斯夫人看出江青从眼角嫉妒地打量她。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mme Mao set her heart on designing a “national costume” for Chinese women. Her design was a collarless top with a three-quarter-length pleated skirt. The ensemble was so unflattering that when pictures of China's female athletes wearing it abroad were published in the newspapers, Chinese women, even though fashion starved, greeted it with universal derision. Still, although her design was a failure as fashion, Mme Mao's love of clothes helped to lift the taboo on women wearing skirts and dresses, which cautiously returned after nearly a decade in 1975.</p><p>最初正是为了跟马科斯夫人比美，江青设计了中国妇女的“国服”：无领对开襟的上衣加半长的百褶裙。当女运动员穿着它在海外参加运动会的照片发表时，女人们哪怕再向往裙装，也觉得不美而嗤之以鼻。但江青毕竟开了头，裙装不再是“违禁品”。文革剪裙子将近十年之后，或飘逸，或庄重的裙子又小心翼翼地重新出现在许多女人身上。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mme Mao tried to have her design made official “national costume.” This required a decision from the Politburo, which decided against, on budgetary grounds. A long pleated skirt would use a lot of material, and if it went into production as “national” garb, huge quantities would be needed. She tried to persuade Mao to reverse the decision by getting his favorite girlfriends to wear the dress for him. But when he heard it had come from her, he rejected it with annoyance, even disgust.</p><p>为了把她设计的衣裙由官方定为“国服”，江青颇费了一番心思。政治局反对，不愿拿钱给全国女人做耗费布料的百褶裙。江青想让毛干预，让得毛欢心的女友穿上给他看。当毛听说衣裙是江青设计的时，把脸一沉说：“快去脱下来，一点都不好，以后不要要她的东西！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MME MAO WAS now reduced to currying favor with Mao's girlfriends to gain access to her husband. Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the couple had been living in separate residences even when they were both in Peking: she in the Imperial Fishing Villa, he in Zhongnanhai. In the early years of the Cultural Revolution, when she was actively involved in running things, she could visit him freely. But as her political role grew less, he restricted her access, and often barred her from his house. The plain fact was that Mao could not stand his wife. But the more she was shunned, the more desperately she tried to get close. She could not afford to be discarded. She would beg Mao's girlfriends to put in a word for her, giving them presents like pretty material for making clothes, even a Swiss watch. On one occasion she talked her way into Mao's house, telling the guards she was there to check “hygiene.” Mao yelled at her to get out, and afterwards told the guards angrily: “Arrest her if she tries to barge in again!”</p><p>如今的江青要见毛还得讨好毛的女友。文革开始后，她跟毛分开居住。初期，她因为管“中央文革”，随时可以见到毛。后来，她的政治作用小了，见毛就不那么容易了，经常是她来到毛的住地，毛不让她進来。毛讨厌她。毛越这样，她越不顾一切地要接近毛。作为毛的妻子，却见不到毛，江青害怕，心中无底。她于是对毛的女友献殷勤，送衣料啊、毛衣啊，甚至送稀罕的瑞士手表，希冀她们在毛跟前替她求情。有一次，她以“检查卫生”为名闯入毛的住地，毛要她“滚”，事后对警卫生气地说：她要是“再闯，就抓起来！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On Mao's eighty-second (and last) birthday on 26 December 1975, his wife was admitted, bringing two of his favorite dishes. Mao acted as though she did not exist, giving her no more than a vacant glance, and not addressing one word to her. She soon left, in a forlorn state, while five young women, mostly former girlfriends, joined Mao for his birthday dinner.</p><p>一九七五年十二月二十六日是毛八十二岁生日，也是他最后一个生日。那天，江青获准来了，带来两样毛喜欢的菜。毛待她好像她不存在，视而不见，听而不闻，一句话也没有。她待了一阵子，无趣而伤心地走了。生日晚餐，毛是跟五个女孩子一道吃的，有女友，有身边工作人员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>These girlfriends were not treated like royal mistresses and showered with gifts and favors. Mao used them, as he did his wife. They provided him with sex, and served him as maids and nurses. In his final year, because he was afraid of assassination, only two people were allowed into his bedroom without his express permission; both were girlfriends-turned-nurses: Zhang Yu-feng, a former stewardess on his train, and Meng Jin-yun, a former actress from the air force song-and-dance troupe. They took turns to do all the work around Mao, on their feet for up to twenty hours a day, on standby around the clock, and usually having to sleep in their clothes. They had little family life, no holidays, no weekends. Mao refused to increase the nursing staff, as they were the only two people he trusted to be constantly near him.</p><p>做毛的女友不像皇室的王妃情妇，没有珠宝首饰，没有千娇百宠，毛用她们为自己服务。在毛最后的一两年，寝室只许两位女性随意進出：张玉凤和孟锦云。张从前是毛专列上的服务员，后来做了毛的秘书，孟是文工团的演员。她们俩做毛身边一切事情，四个小时轮换一次，日夜随叫随到，睡觉也不敢脱衣服。她们的家庭生活少得可怜，基本没有周末休息，度假就更谈不上了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Meng, the former actress, longed to leave, and asked her fellow nurse Yu-feng to put in a plea for her, saying that she was nearly thirty years old and wanted to spend some time with her husband so that she could have a child. “Wait till after I die and then she can have a child,” was Mao's reply. Yu-feng herself had a baby daughter who needed her milk (there was no baby food in China in those days). As she was unable to go home every day, she tried to feed the baby by squeezing her milk into a bottle and putting it in a fridge at Mao's, and taking it home when she had a moment to spare. But the baby became ill from the milk. She felt anxious all the time about her child. Sometimes, when she was reading to Mao in a state of utter exhaustion, she would start to mumble her daughter's name. None of this moved Mao enough to lessen her workload.</p><p>孟锦云很想离开，请张玉凤帮她在毛面前说说，说她快三十了，“真想要个小孩呢”。毛的回答是：“等我死了，她再要吧。”张玉凤本人有个女儿，中国那时没有婴儿食品，女儿得吃她的奶。可她不能每天回家，只得把奶挤在瓶子里，把瓶子放在毛的冰箱里，有机会回家时带去。婴儿吃这样的奶生了病，她焦急不堪。由于天天心里都惦记孩子，给毛读文件有时会不由自主地念起女儿的名字来。难处再大，毛也不考虑给她减少工作负担。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Few of the many women Mao had eyes for turned him down, but one does seem to have done so: his elegant English teacher and interpreter, Zhang Han-zhi. One day in late 1972, after she had been interpreting for Mao, he took her to a staff room down the corridor, and burst out in tremendous agitation: “You don't have me in your heart! You just don't have me in your heart!” Taken aback, she blurted out: “Chairman, how can I possibly not have you in my heart? Everyone in China has you in their heart.” He let her go. She continued to be his interpreter, and Mao even promoted the man she loved (and went on to marry) to be foreign minister. But Mao visited punishment on him by subjecting him to bouts of denunciation at the hands of Foreign Ministry staff.</p><p>毛看上的女人很少有拒绝他的，但他的英语翻译章含之是个例外。一九七二年底的一天，见外宾后，毛把长相秀雅的章留下，叫到工作人员的屋子里，激动地对她说：“你心里没有我！你心里就是没有我！”章巧妙地答道：“主席，这么说我担当不起，我心里怎么没有你，全中国人民心里都有你。”毛让她走了，继续用她做翻译，还把她深爱的后来与之结婚的乔冠华提拔为外交部长。但是毛也要外交部的人几度整乔。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ONE PERSON WHO did love Mao was his youngest daughter, Li Na, his only child with Jiang Qing. Born in 1940, Li Na had grown up by his side, and as a child her patter had helped to relax him. She had worshipped her father, as is clear from a letter she wrote him when she was fourteen, on 8 February 1955:</p><p>毛与江青的独生女李讷是毛最年幼的孩子，生于一九四0年，长在毛身边，年幼时的天真呢喃曾给毛带来欢乐，使他放松。李讷十四岁时给毛写过这样一封充满爱意的信。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dear Daddy,</p><p>亲爱的爸爸：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Are you asleep? You must be having a sweet, sweet sleep.</p><p>你在睡觉吗？一定睡得很香吧？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>You must be surprised why I'm writing to you all of a sudden. What happened was: when you were having your birthday, I wanted to give you a present, but before I finished embroidering a handkerchief, your birthday was gone. Also my embroidery was so bad, so I didn't give it to you. Because I know you wouldn't be angry with me, and you are my good Daddy, right? This time, Mummy's birthday is coming, so I wanted to take this chance to make it up. You might not like the thing I'm giving you, but I made it myself. It's small, but shows my feelings: I wish my dearest Little Daddy always young, kind and optimistic …</p><p>你一定奇怪，我为什么突然要写信给你。事情是这样：在你过生日的时候，我想给你送礼，一块手绢还没有绣成，你的生日就过去了。而且也绣得很不好，于是我就没有送。因为我知道你不会生气，你是我的好爸爸，对吗？这次妈妈的生日就要到了，就趁此补补吧，我送的东西也许你不喜欢，但这是我亲手做出来的。东西虽然小，但表示我的心意：我愿我最亲的小爸爸永远年轻，慈祥，乐观，你教导我怎样生活，怎样去做人，我爱你呀！小爸爸，我愿你永远活着和我们生活在一起。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was signed “Kisses, Your daughter who passionately loves you.”</p><p> 吻你 热烈爱着你的女儿</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao wanted his daughter to grow up to be useful politically, and steered her in that direction. Back in 1947, when the Communists were vacating Yenan, he insisted that she stay within earshot of the shelling and the shooting, even though she was only six years old. A tearful Mme Mao pleaded for her to be evacuated, but Mao shouted at his wife: “Get the hell out of here! The child is not going. I want her here to listen to gunfire!”</p><p>毛希望女儿长大后对他政治上有所帮助，从小便照此培养她。一九四七年中共撤离延安时，尽管她只有六岁，毛要她等国民党军迫近时再走，对她说：“看看飞机轰炸，听听炮声，也是个锻练。大人需要锻练，小孩子也需要锻练。”江青替女儿担忧，哭着要先把女儿送走，毛大怒，把饭桌猛然一掀，饭菜撒了一地，喝道：“你滚蛋！小孩子不能走，我就要她在这里听听炮声！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao started to groom her as his assistant when the Cultural Revolution started in 1966. Aged twenty-six, she had just graduated from Peking University in modern Chinese history, a subject she said she did not particularly like, but accepted, because the Party wanted more children from elite families to become Party historians. Her father assigned her to the army's main newspaper, where she started work as one of the special reporters, gathering information for him. Mao's goal was for her to take control of the paper, which she accomplished in August 1967, while the editorial and management boards were carted off to prison. A cult was then fostered around her. The paper's offices—and even staffers' homes—were covered with posters “saluting” her, and slogans shouted at rallies proclaimed that whoever opposed her was a counter-revolutionary. An exhibition room was opened at the paper to display her “great merit,” showing things like her tea mug and her bicycle, implying that it was saintly of her not to be using fine china or a limousine.</p><p>李讷上的大学是北大，学的是中国现代史。据她说她并不喜欢这个科目，但党号召干部子弟带头学，她就学了。文革开始时她刚毕业，二十六岁，毛派她去《解放军报》替他把住军队喉舌。她先做特派记者，在全国各地收集文革情况，当毛的耳目。一九六七年八月，她通过两度夺权，把军报抓在手里，原先的领导人以各种罪名打倒、关押。军报接着掀起了对她的个人崇拜。办公室乃至宿舍家庭都贴满了向她“学习”、“致敬”的标语，大会小会上，“谁反对肖力(李讷的化名)同志谁就是现行反革命”，“谁反对肖力同志就打倒谁”是必呼的口号。报社特地开辟一间“肖力丰功伟绩”展览室，展览她骑的蓝色自行车、喝水用的大白茶缸，说是表现了她“艰苦朴素的作风”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Her behavior changed at this time. Having at first seemed unpretentious, now she would scream at senior staff to stand to attention in front of her, shrieking: “I really wish I could have you shot!” She declared that she was going to impose “thug rule,” using an arcane expression that she had clearly learned from her father. Over 60 percent of the old staff at the newspaper suffered appalling persecution for allegedly opposing her. Among the many who were tortured was a former personal friend who had expressed disagreement with her over some minor matter.</p><p>李讷变了。刚来时她还挺谦虚，口口声声说：“爸爸要我来向叔叔阿姨学习。” 现在她自己坐在沙发上，让老编辑站在面前，咬牙切齿地发火：“你给我立正！”“我恨不得枪毙你！”她宣告她要在军报实行王道与霸道“王，霸杂用”的方针。认识李讷的人都说她头脑并不出众，这样的用语显然不是她想得出来的，而是她爸爸教的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>在这位人称“天上掉下的毛姑娘”的统治下，军报百分之六十以上的人以反对她的罪名受到残酷迫害，其中有她的朋友，就因为在小事上对她表示过不同意见。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Early in 1968, because Mao was shutting down his personal channels in the army in order to please Lin Biao, Li Na was taken off the paper. Her next job was no less critical: director of the Small Group's private office. The position was vacated for her by a simple expedient, typical of Mme Mao's modus operandi. Mme Mao accused the existing director of being a spy and had him clapped in jail. Li Na then took over his job until the Small Group was dissolved in 1969.</p><p>一九六八年初，毛把军队管理全部交给林彪时，李讷离开了军报。她马上接管了同样重要的职位：中央文革办事组组长。为了把这个位子空出来，她妈妈把李讷的前任送進监牢。李讷在这个位子上一直待到“九大”中央文革小组解散。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao had intended her for even higher office—controller of Peking. But in 1972 she had a nervous breakdown, and floated in and out of insanity for years, until after his death. It seems that, unlike her parents, Li Na did not thrive on persecution, and that after her early zealousness to enforce her father's orders, she was driven out of her mind by the constant victimizations she was expected to carry out. On one occasion, she picked up a pile of documents about the purge and suicide of a man she knew, and threw them out of the window, shouting: “Don't give me any more of this rubbish! I've been sick and tired of it for ages!”</p><p>毛的设想是让她管北京。但一九七二年，李讷得了精神病，此后多年时反时复，直到毛死后才渐渐痊愈。据了解她的人说，李讷不像她父母，并不以整人为赏心乐事，对无休止地迫害人的生活逐渐感到不能忍受。有一次，她认识的中央办公厅副主任王良恩自杀。当江青的秘书奉命给李讷送去批王简报时，她粗略看了一下题目，就生气地大喊：“叫我看他妈的这些干什么？！”猛一下把这叠简报从窗户扔到院子里，散落了一地，说：“以后不要再给我送这些乱七八糟的东西给我看，我早就烦透了！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She longed for affection. Her mother, who had loved her when she was a child, now, like her father, narrowed their relationship down to one based exclusively on politics, and gave her no warmth or comfort. When she was heading for a nervous breakdown, reliant for short-term relief on more and more massive amounts of sleeping pills, Li Na had no one to turn to. As a young woman, she yearned for a love relationship, but with Mao for a father, and especially with Jiang Qing for a mother, no man dared to court her, and no match-making enthusiast fancied inviting trouble. It was only when she was thirty-one, in 1971, that she herself approached a young servant. When she wrote to her father for permission to marry, he only asked the messenger a few basic questions, and then wrote on the letter simply: “Agree.” Mao's wedding present was a set of leaden tomes which he himself never read: the works of Marx and Engels.</p><p>李讷渴望温情。江青从前曾给她很多的爱，如今也像毛一样，把母女关系局限到冷酷的政治领域。李讷快精神崩溃了，靠吃大量的安眠药来求得短暂的睡眠，她没有可以交心的人。作为一个年轻女人，她自然期望爱情，但没有男人敢向她求爱，也没有媒人愿意自找麻烦来引线穿针。三十一岁那年，她主动向一个年轻服务员求婚。她写信给毛请求批准时，毛问了带信人几个简单的问题，在信上批道：“同意。” 给她的结婚礼物是毛自己也没看过的一套马克思、恩格斯全集。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Neither of her parents came to her simple wedding, which Mme Mao had only grudgingly accepted, regarding the bridegroom as beneath her daughter, since he had been a servant. For a while after the marriage, Li Na seemed to be prone to colds and high temperatures, which Mme Mao blamed on her daughter having sex with the son-in-law, and insultingly ordered him to have a physical check-up. It did not take her long to have her son-in-law banished to another city, claiming that he “looks like a spy.” The marriage collapsed, and Li Na sank into a deep depression.</p><p>婚礼父母都没有参加。江青不满意女婿，认为他是个仆人，配不上女儿。结婚后一段时间，李讷经常感冒发烧，尽管这跟“性”南辕北辙，江青怪罪到女婿身上，说他“身体有毛病”，命令他去医院检查。不久，她说女婿“有坐探的嫌疑”，把他送去石家庄。李讷的婚姻很快瓦解，精神严重地垮了下来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In May 1972, Li Na gave birth to a son, which briefly brightened up her life. But Jiang Qing disliked the baby because she despised its father, and never once held it in her arms. Mao showed zero interest in this grandson, as in his other three grandchildren.</p><p>一九七二年五月，李讷生了个男孩，给她阴郁的生活带来光明。但欢乐是短暂的。江青因为看不起女婿，也看不起这个外孙，不认他是毛家的后代，没抱过他一次。毛对孙儿、孙女没有兴趣和感情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With no love or joy in her life, Li Na lapsed into insanity. As far as Mao was concerned, she had run out of use. He saw less and less of her, and evinced no concern about her mental or physical condition.*</p><p>李讷得了精神分裂症。毛很少见她了，对她的身体、精神状况也没有多少关心的表示。文革后，李讷重新结了婚，过着正常人的日子。对文革中发生的许多事，她“全忘了”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MAO HAD SIMILARLY lost interest in his other daughter, Chiao-chiao, who had no political flair. Years before, when she returned from Russia as a pretty twelve-year-old, exotic in her Russian wool skirt and leather shoes, with Russian manners, and speaking Russian, Mao had showered her with affection, and shown her off, calling her “my little foreigner.” And she had been deliriously happy. But when she lost the entertainment value she had had as a child, and turned out politically worthless as an adult, she found she had diminishing access to Mao. In the last few years of his life, she only very rarely got to see him. She went to the gate of Zhongnanhai several times, but he refused to let her in. She had a nervous breakdown, and was in and out of depression for years.</p><p>毛的另外一个女儿娇娇(李敏)不是个搞政治的人。她十二岁从苏联回国时，是个带着异国情趣的漂亮小姑娘，穿着俄罗斯式的薄呢裙子，脚上一双当时中国少见的皮鞋，举止洋味儿十足，说话都是俄文。毛对她充满爱意，管她叫“我的小外国人”， 还请一些领导人到家里来，向大家炫耀他的“洋宝贝”。那时娇娇快乐极了。长大成人后，她不能再给毛童稚时的乐趣，政治上又帮不了毛，见毛的机会就越来越少了。在毛的晚年，好几次，她来到中南海大门口，请求见爸爸，但毛不让她進去。后来她也患了精神病。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao's oldest son An-ying had been killed in the Korean War in 1950. The only surviving son, An-ching, was mentally ill. Mao provided him with a comfortable life, but hardly ever saw him, and did not regard him as a member of the family. Mao was wont to say that his family consisted of five members: himself and Mme Mao, the two daughters, and his only nephew, Yuan-xin.</p><p>毛的长子岸英死于朝鲜战争。唯一活着的次子岸青脑子有病。毛给他提供了舒适的生活，但不把他当作家庭成员。毛常说他家有五口人：他，江青、两个女儿和侄儿远新。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The nephew had spent much of his youth in Mao's family. During the Cultural Revolution, when he was still in his early thirties, he was catapulted into the post of political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, in which capacity he helped Mao control Manchuria, the critical area in the northeast bordering with Russia. One of his later best-known acts there was to order the execution of a brave female Party member called Zhang Zhi-xin, who had openly challenged Mme Mao and the Great Purge. Just before she was shot, she was pinned to the floor of her cell and her windpipe was slit, to prevent her from speaking out at the execution ground, even though it was a secret execution. This cruelty was gratuitous, as execution victims routinely had a cord put around their neck that could be yanked to choke them if they tried to speak.</p><p>毛远新是毛的弟弟泽民的儿子，从小在毛家长大。文革初期他才大学毕业不久，几年之中就当上了沈阳军区政委，为毛把持毗邻苏联的东北。他在东北干的最着名的事，是下令枪毙公开反对文革、反对江青的女共产党员张志新。尽管枪毙是秘密的，又有一套阻止犯人说话的措施，如在脖子上套一根绳索，一说话就拉紧，当局还是对张志新的声音万一传出怕得要命，在临刑前割断了她的喉管。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As well as being ruthless, Yuan-xin belonged to the family. Mao made him his liaison with the Politburo in the final year of his life, 1975–76. Actually, Yuan-xin's own father, Mao's brother Tse-min, had been killed partly as the result of Mao giving instructions not to try to save him when he was in prison in Xinjiang in the early 1940s—a fact carefully concealed from Yuan-xin, as from everyone else.</p><p>毛远新是毛信赖的自家人。毛在生命的最后一年，派他做自己与政治局之间的联络员。毛远新有所不知的是，四十年代初期他父亲在新疆被捕被杀，毛曾有意见死不救。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao had been the cause of the death of his second wife too. After being abandoned by Mao, Kai-hui had been executed in 1930 as a direct result of his attacking Changsha, where she was living, for reasons that were entirely to do with his drive for personal power. And he was also largely responsible for the repeated and eventually irreversible mental breakdowns of his third wife, Gui-yuan (who died, aged seventy-five, in 1984).</p><p>毛是他遗弃的第二任妻子杨开慧被害的直接原因，对第三任妻子贺子珍的精神错乱也负有责任。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Over the decades, Mao had brought ill fortune to virtually every member of his family. His final betrayal was towards his fourth and last wife, Jiang Qing. After getting her to do much of his dirty work, and knowing how much she was loathed, he made no provision for safeguarding her after he died. On the contrary, he offered her up as a trade-off to the “opposition” that emerged near the end of his life. In return for guaranteeing his own safety while he was alive, they were told that after he died, they could do as they pleased with Mme Mao and her group of cronies, which included Mao's nephew Yuan-xin. Less than a month after Mao's death, the whole group ended up in prison. In 1991 Mme Mao committed suicide.</p><p>毛给几乎所有家庭成员都带来悲剧，最后轮到的是江青。毛先尽量利用她充当打手，使她成了人人痛恨的对象，然后又用她做挡箭牌，以保障自己生前的安全。江青在毛死后不到一个月被捕，就是毛和他的“反对派”交易的结果。一九九一年五月十四日，江青在监禁中自尽。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>*Today, Li Na has recovered, and leads a normal life. She appears to have “forgotten” her role in the Cultural Revolution.</p><p></p></div>
