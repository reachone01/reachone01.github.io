<div class='layout'><p> 18 NEW IMAGE, NEW LIFE AND NEW WIFE</p><p>18 陕北的新生活</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> (1937–38   AGE 43–44)</p><p>1937～1938 年    43～44 岁</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>AS SOON AS the dust from the kidnapping settled, in January 1937 Moscow told Mao exactly how it viewed the next stage. The CCP was to abandon its policy of trying to overthrow the government by violence, and stop confiscating land and robbing the rich; instead, it would in effect recognize Nanjing as the legitimate government, and put the Red territory and Red Army under Chiang. Mao accepted the shift as a purely tactical expedient, and the CCP made a public pledge to Nanjing that embodied the policy changes willed by Moscow. This opened a new phase for the Party.</p><p>蒋介石获得自由不久，一九三七年一月，莫斯科为中共规划好了下一步的蓝图：放弃武力推翻南京政府的政策，停止阶级斗争，承认南京为合法政府，置红区和红军于它管辖之下。毛接受了这一转变，把它作为权宜之计。中共向南京做出公开保证。一个历史新时期开始了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As a quid pro quo, Chiang was to assign some territory to the Red Army, and fund the Communist administration and army. Mao naturally went all out to get the largest possible swath of territory and the highest level of funding. In the end, the Reds were allocated 129,600 square kilometers of ground, with a population of about 2 million, and Yenan as their capital. This settlement brought substantial government funding. Chiang also armed and paid for over 46,000 regular Red troops (the number he officially recognized).</p><p>经过谈判，中共最后得到一块十二万九千六百平方公里、两百万人口的陕甘宁边区，首府在延安。边区由南京政府资助，蒋同时发军费给养给四万六千红军。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In order to help Mao achieve these gains, Stalin held on to Chiang's son. Not until he was satisfied about Chiang's concessions did he deliver. On 3 March the Soviet Politburo decreed, in its peculiar crabbed idiom, “Not to oppose the return to China of Chiang Kai-shek's son.” Ching-kuo returned to China on 19 April, and was reunited with his father after more than eleven years as a hostage.*</p><p>斯大林只是在对蒋介石的让步满意之后才释放蒋经国。三月三日，苏共政治局作出决定，装腔作势地说：“不反对蒋介石的儿子返回中国。”四月十九日，做人质十一年多的经国终于回到中国，与父亲团聚。离苏前，斯大林亲自给他“做工作”，季米特洛夫也一再威胁他。经国当面表现得很顺从，归程中给季米特洛夫发电报说：“您所有的指示都将圆满完成。”到了海参嵗，他被带去当地克格勃的办公处，在那里他最后一次对莫斯科表演忠诚：“我将严格执行党的纪律。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During the week-long train journey across Siberia, Ching-kuo was in the custody of the future CCP intelligence chief, Kang Sheng. Only a few weeks before, Kang Sheng had brought Mao's sons from Paris to Moscow. An-ying and An-ching, aged fourteen and twelve, had been waiting for Russian visas in Paris for months. The Russians had not wanted to admit the Young Marshal's envoy, who was escorting them, but had not wanted to give a straightforward refusal, so they withheld visas for the whole group. After the Xian kidnap was over, the envoy was told he would not get a visa. The Mao boys arrived in Moscow at the beginning of 1937, and became boarders in the special school for children of foreign Communist leaders. They wrote to their father, sending photos. He rarely replied.</p><p>送经国乘火车穿过漫长的西伯利亚的，是后来中共克格勃头子康生。几个星期前，康生刚把十四岁的岸英和十二岁的岸青从巴黎接到莫斯科。毛的儿子们在巴黎等了好几个月签证。因为苏联人不想发签证给护送他们的张学良使者，连带他们的也拖着没给。西安事变后，苏联宣布不给张学良使者签证，打发他回国。而毛的儿子在一九三七年初到达莫斯科。他们给爸爸写信，给他寄照片。毛很少回信。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>WHILE MAO'S ATTITUDE to his sons was one of indifference, Chiang Kai-shek's amounted to obsession. In February 1937, when Stalin was still holding Ching-kuo, and Chiang was impatiently waiting for him to be returned, the Generalissimo did another favor to the CCP, which had far-reaching repercussions. He appointed the mole Shao Li-tzu (who had taken Chiang's son to Russia in 1925) as head of the Nationalists' Propaganda Department, in charge of the media. Shao's job was to bring about a change of attitude in the press and in public opinion, which were both fiercely anti-Communist. It was an enormous gesture of good will to Moscow.</p><p>与毛对儿子的冷漠感情相反，蒋介石为了尽快让经国回来，不断让步。他甚至在一九三七年二月，任命带经国去苏联的邵力子做国民党的中央宣传部部长，以纠正一向反共的报界和公众舆论。这个对莫斯科作的姿态，为中共的发展起了不可估量的作用。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Soviet Russia henceforth received wide and enthusiastic coverage. A benign and positive image of the Chinese Communists began to emerge. By summer, Shao and Mao had concocted the idea of publishing a Mao autobiography portraying Mao as a good and kindly man, complete with an appendix of his pronouncements on war with Japan that depicted him as committed to fighting the Japanese. Mao wrote an inscription in the tone of an ardent patriot: “Fight the Japanese imperialists unwaveringly through to the end …” The book came out on 1 November and was a hit. It was this period that gave birth to the myth, which was vital to Mao's success, that the CCP was the most dedicated anti-Japanese force. It was thanks to this myth that many tens of thousands joined the Communists, including many of those who were later to staff Mao's regime.</p><p>邵力子做中宣部长期间，苏联得到广泛热情的宣传，中共也显得和善可亲。邵批准出了本《毛泽东自传》， 把毛表现成一个人性十足的好人，坚决抗日的爱国者。扉页上毛题词说要“同日本帝国主义坚决打到底”。自传于十一月一日出版，风靡一时。就在这段时间，中共积极抗日的形象出世了，公众对中共的印象也变得好起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Mao Tse-tung Autobiography consisted largely of interviews Mao had done with the American journalist Edgar Snow in summer 1936—the only extensive account of his life Mao ever gave. Snow also produced his own book, Red Star Over China, which relied overwhelmingly on interviews with Mao and other Communists, and laid the foundation for the rehabilitation of the Reds, not least by brushing out their blood-soaked past.</p><p>《毛泽东自传》大部分是美国记者斯诺在头年夏天对毛的访问记，毛一生仅此一次对人系统地谈自己的生平。根据这些谈话和对其他中共领导的采访，斯诺写了本《红星照耀中国》(Red Star Over China)，在全球为中共重塑形象，把它血淋淋的过去从人们脑子里抹去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The encounter with Snow was no accident. That spring, Mao had asked the Shanghai underground to find a foreign journalist who could publicize his story, plus a doctor. After careful vetting, Mao invited Snow, who combined all the necessary qualities: he was American, wrote for the influential Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald-Tribune, and was sympathetic. Snow arrived in the Red area in July, with a Lebanese-American doctor, George Hatem, who brought top-secret documents from the Comintern in his medicine case. Snow stayed for three months, while Hatem remained with the Reds for the rest of his life, becoming one of Mao's doctors, and working in the CCP's foreign intelligence apparatus.</p><p>斯诺的访毛并非偶然。是毛叫上海地下党找一个可以为他做宣传的外国记者，再找一个医生。毛选中了斯诺，看中他是美国人，为有影响力的大报《周末晚邮报》(Saturday Evening Post)和《纽约先锋论坛报》(New York Herald Tribune)写文章，也同情中共。斯诺七月来到红区，同行的是黎巴嫩裔美国籍医生马海德(George Hatem)，药箱里藏着共产国际的绝密文件。马海德留下来做毛的医生。斯诺住了三个月。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao left nothing to chance, and dictated detailed instructions on handling Snow's visit: “Security, secrecy, warmth and red carpet.” The Politburo carefully coordinated answers to a questionnaire Snow had to submit beforehand. Mao offered Snow a mixture of valuable information and colossal falsification, which Snow swallowed in toto, calling Mao and the CCP leadership “direct, frank, simple, undevious.” Mao covered up years of torture and murder, such as the AB purges, and invented battles and heroism like the crossing of the Dadu bridge in the trek across China, astutely now titled “the Long March.” He led Snow to believe that, except when he was ill, he had “walked most of the 6,000 miles of the Long March, like the rank and file.” Mao also completely suppressed his links with Moscow, and claimed he wanted friendship with America—a claim that fooled many.</p><p>毛着实准备了一番，要求是“安全、保密、热闹，隆重”，政治局根据斯诺交来的问题单预备了答案。毛对斯诺讲的故事既有宝贵的讯息，也有大量的虚构，斯诺一概不加分析全盘接受。他称毛和中共领导“直率、坦白、直来直去不耍花样”，相信“在六千英里的长征途中，除了几个星期生病以外，毛泽东和普通战士一样都是步行的”。毛掩盖了中共跟莫斯科的关系，声称他倒喜欢跟美国友好，斯诺照本宣科，使许多人至今仍信以为真。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao took the added precaution of checking everything Snow wrote afterwards, and amending and rewriting parts. On 26 July 1937 (before Red Star came out) Snow wrote to his wife Helen, who was then in Yenan: “Don't send me any more notes about people reneging on their stories to me … As it is, with so many things cut out it begins to read like Childe Harold.” Snow omitted to mention this background in Red Star, and instead alleged that Mao “never imposed any censorship on me.” The Chinese edition even gilded Snow, and had him say that he found Mao's words “honest and true.”</p><p>斯诺写的一切都经毛细细过目，改了又改。他给那时尚在延安的妻子海伦(Helen Snow)信说：“别再给我寄更多的谁谁谁要改他们的话的要求来了……就这样，砍了这么多东西，书读起来快像海外奇谭了。但斯诺对这个背景绝口不提，相反说毛“绝没有审改任何我的东西”。斯诺的中译本还添枝加叶，说他称赞毛“真诚、老实”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Red Star was published in English in winter 1937–38, and played a big role in swaying Western opinion in favor of Mao. The CCP organized its publication in Chinese, under the title Stories of a Journey to the West, to make it appear impartial. In addition to this book and the Mao Tse-tung Autobiography, a third book was produced out of the Snow material, under another neutral-sounding title, Impressions of Mao Tse-tung.</p><p>《红星照耀中国》的英文本在一九三七、一九三八年之交出版，影响了整个西方对毛和中共的看法。中文是中共组织翻译的，特别选了个灰色的书名《西行漫记》， 使人觉得这是本客观中性的书。除了这本书跟《毛泽东自传》以外，斯诺的访问记还出了另一种单行本，也有个中性的题目：《毛泽东印象记》。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Red Star—and the two books of edited excerpts—profoundly influenced radical youth in China. Many, like one of the first Tibetan Communists, joined the Communists as a result of reading Snow. It was the beginning of the CCP's renaissance. Mao was to say that its publication “had a merit no less than the Great Yu controlling floods.” The Great Yu was the mythical emperor who had brought floods under control, thus starting Chinese civilization.</p><p>斯诺的书在中国激進青年中产生了巨大影响，吸引了千千万万热血青年参加中共，其中有西藏共产党最早的成员。中共的复兴从这时开端。毛后来赞美斯诺，说他“不下大禹治水之功”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As Chiang Kai-shek's media chief, Shao played an indispensable role in assisting Snow and promoting Mao and the Reds. By the time Chiang removed Shao from the post after nearly a year, Mao and the Reds had sanitized their image.</p><p>功不在斯诺之下的是中宣部长邵力子。蒋介石在将近一年之后解除邵的职务时，毛与中共的名誉已经被大大漂白了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>FOR THE NEXT DECADE, Mao lived in Yenan, the capital of the territories Chiang assigned to the Reds. He moved into the city on New Year's Day 1937, through a huge gate, which majestically and silently opened up to columns of Red Army soldiers, marching along the broad dirt road that stretched into the infinity of yellow earth. This ancient city (whose name means “extending peace”) was enclosed by high thick walls that mounted the chain of loess hills far above the city, with battlements exuding warrior stateliness. In dry, crisp air beneath a high blue sky, it was dominated by a nine-story pagoda, built 1,000 years before. Beneath the pagoda was a complex of temples, many appearing to be clinging to the cliffs. Further down, the heavily silted River Yan was joined by the Tu Fu River, named after the great eighth-century poet, who reputedly came here to admire the peonies, a local claim to fame.</p><p>毛在一九三七年元旦那天搬進延安，在这里他将一住十年。搬家那天，延安宏伟的城门洞开，庄严而沉默地容纳了一眼望不到尾的红军队伍。古城名字的意思是“延伸安宁”，城却由充满军旅气息的城墙围着，沿山而上。俯瞰延安城的还有一座千年九层宝塔，塔下依山建着大小庙宇跟佛像，好似从天外飞来。清凉山下是黄沙沉沉的延河。唐代诗圣杜甫据说曾来此欣赏过名产牡丹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yenan was not only a cultural center, but also a hub of commercial activities. Oil had been discovered in the region. Living quarters built by Standard Oil were now taken over by the Reds, who also appropriated substantial buildings owned by the Spanish Franciscans, including a just-completed cathedral, in which many key Party meetings were to take place. The problem of housing was further eased by the fact that many locals had fled, particularly the relatively wealthy, leaving empty hundreds of houses, some large and beautiful. Mao occupied one such mansion in a place called Phoenix Village. The big courtyard was by local standards grand, with a decorated wall immediately inside, facing the gate, to ward off evil spirits—and for privacy. For the first time in over two years, he settled into some comfort.</p><p>延安不仅见识过繁荣的文化活动，还曾是工商业要地。标准石油公司(Standard Oil)在此勘探石油时，修了好些住宅，如今正好由红军接管。红军还占用了西班牙天主教士的房产，其中有一座大教堂，不少中共的重要会议将在这里召开。许多当地人，特别是有钱人，闻“红”而逃，留下了几百幢空屋。毛选中了一所大而美的房子，位于城边凤凰村，進门迎面一堵气派的照壁。长征以来，毛泽东第一次过上了舒适的日子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One considerable luxury for its place and time was wall heating, which Mao had installed. The usual way of heating a house in northern China was to heat the brick bed, the kang, from underneath, but Mao preferred his proper wooden bed, and for heating, he selected this most deluxe form. Another indulgence was to have several residences. When he later moved to an area called Yang Hill, he kept the house in Phoenix Village, and he kept both when he settled in the compound of the Chinese KGB, the picturesque area known as the Date Garden. In addition to these publicly known residences, Mao had secret dwellings built in secluded valleys, one behind Yang Hill and another behind the Date Garden. Few knew of their existence, then or now.</p><p>毛喜欢舒适，住宅装有当地罕见的墙中地下暖气。他不喜欢睡炕，安了木板床。毛拥有好几所住房，虽然搬了几次家，住过的房子都保留着。一处在中共克格勃的大院枣园，有高墙围着，严密的警卫守着，是一个人们望而却步的地方。另一处更机密的住地在枣园后沟。重重叠叠的山峦深处，沿着山崖凹進去的地方，给毛修了一排窑洞，他可以坐汽车从加宽的小路一直开到门口。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>跟他大多数住宅一样，毛在枣园后沟的房间有个后门，直通一条秘密地道，以备紧急时跑到山的另一边。毛也可以由秘密地道直接登上一座大礼堂的主席台，无需走出房门，减少暴露的危险。大礼堂和毛的窑洞都要走到跟前才看得见，但从这里却能把远近来人收入眼底。大礼堂由一个曾在意大利学建筑的人设计，看上去像个天主教堂。除了中共克格勃人员在这里开过几次会外，它从来没用过。毛要的是极端机密。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>毛的助手师哲告诉我们：“我住在通往枣园后沟的那个口子上，我控制住，别人不能随便到那里去。”中共领导要见毛得“事先跟我打个招呼，他们很少去”。只有陕北本地的领导人高岗有时来，“我就把他挡住，挡了好几次。我说不行，不管你高岗，还是什么人，不能去。”偶尔進去的人，“只能一个人進去。带一个警卫员可以，但也不能走到毛泽东住的地方。中央警卫团专人带首长一个人進去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The most public residence was Yang Hill, which was also the least grand, and closest to the local peasants. Ten households lived in the face of a ravine, against a hill thickly wooded in those days with elms, cypresses and redwood poplar. The houses were yao-dong, unique to this part of the country, which looked like caves hollowed out of the loess slopes. Mao had a row of yao-dong in a courtyard with a small gate surmounted by a tiled roof. One of his neighbors, a peasant family, did the laundry for him. Mao's cook he had brought with him, for security—as well as culinary—reasons. He also declined to share the peasants' stone roller for grinding his grain: “Chairman Mao considered things from a safety point of view,” the locals told us. He was surrounded by very tight security, some visible, some not.</p><p>最公开、离当地人最近的住宅是杨家岭，背靠布满杨树、梨树、柏树的山坡。一家邻居为他洗衣缝补。厨师是自己的，加工米和面也不用当地人的磨子，那是“毛主席从安全角度考虑”，当地人说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Mao, Yenan provided the first relatively stable and non-violent period for nearly a decade. With peace and a rather good life—and the sudden availability of glamorous, educated young women, who were beginning to trickle into Yenan to the lure of the Reds' benign new image—Mao started to womanize more or less openly. He confided to a fellow-philanderer that he could only go without sex “for forty days at the most.”</p><p>近十年了，毛泽东的生活还从来没有这么稳定安宁过。共产党的新形象吸引来一批批城市青年，忽然间，他身边有了些时髦漂亮的女孩子。毛按捺不住了，他对也喜欢追逐女人的高岗说，没有性生活的日子他只能维持最多“四十天”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ONE OF THE FIRST young women on the scene was a beautiful (and married) 26-year-old actress, Lily Wu, who arrived in early 1937 and became the star actress of Yenan. Her elegant clothes and manners turned heads in this back-country region, and her flowing, shoulder-length hair, in particular, was the symbol of desirability. Communist women mostly wore bulky uniforms and had shaved off their hair to get rid of lice. Mao started a relationship with her.</p><p>最初让毛泽东看上的，是美丽的二十六岁女演员吴莉莉。吴一九三七年来到延安，立刻成了明星。她的雅致时装和风度使这个偏远小城大为倾倒，甩来甩去的披肩秀发更牵动着无数男人的心。中共妇女只有臃肿的棉袄可穿，甚至不少人剃了光头以避虱子。不久，用贺子珍的话说，毛就跟吴小姐上了床(斯诺夫人海伦称吴小姐为毛贺婚姻中的“第三者”)。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Lily struck up a friendship with a visiting American writer, Agnes Smedley, who was an outspoken radical feminist. Smedley had worked for the Comintern, but was something of a loose cannon, and Moscow had sent instructions “to isolate her.” Even so, and although she found that Mao had a “sinister quality,” both “feminine” and “physically repulsive,” Mao cultivated her, and gave her a long interview, because she was American. Mao sent a copy of the interview to Snow, asking him to give it “wide publicity.”</p><p>跟吴小姐关系亲密的是美国女作家史沫特莱，一位呐喊疾呼的女权主义者。尽管共产国际传令“孤立她”，也尽管她觉得毛“阴阳怪气”，“身体女气恶心”，毛仍然看在她是美国作家的份上跟她拉关系，让她做采访。毛把她写的访问记寄给斯诺，请斯诺“大为宣传”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While Lily Wu's good looks stirred Mao's lust, the much less good-looking Smedley caused a tornado by organizing square-dancing, accompanied by phonograph records. The dances were swamped. At first, Smedley observed, “Pride prevented him [Mao] from trying to dance. He had no rhythm in his being.” He basically just “walked the floor,” the women who danced with him noted. But he soon came to see the advantage of the dances as a form of exercise—and as a way to pick up women. Weekly dances were organized, some in the open air, others in a former church. Yenan went wild about dancing.</p><p>其貌不扬的史沫特莱给延安带来交际舞的热潮。据史沫特莱说，毛最初“出于傲气不愿意学跳舞。他没有什么音乐感。”(后来跟他跳过舞的女人也说毛跳舞像“在场上走圈子”。)但毛很快就热中跳舞了，这有利于锻练身体，更是猎艳的大好机会。于是每个星期都组织舞会，或在露天，或在从前的教堂里。延安像发疯一样迷上了跳舞。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Together with other Long March women, Mao's wife, Gui-yuan, at first refused to attend. According to Snow, “The close embrace of bodies involved seemed positively indecent to the old guard.” Jealousy seems to have played a big—if unavowed—role. Also repressed was their secret fondness for this pleasure: Gui-yuan later came to love dancing and was good at it.</p><p>像许多长征女红军一样，贺子珍起先拒绝跳舞。斯诺的观察是：“身体这样紧贴着，在这些老党员看来简直是不知羞耻。”其实，她们是怕自己在那些城市姑娘面前献丑。不少人心里悄悄为这一乐趣强烈吸引，子珍后来爱上了跳舞，是个优美的舞伴。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She found Mao's womanizing intolerable. One night in June, Smedley heard Gui-yuan screaming from the adjacent cave, where Lily lived. “Son of a pig, turtle's egg, whoremongering no-good! How dare you sneak in here to sleep with the little bourgeois bitch!” Smedley went next door and found Gui-yuan lashing out at Mao with a flashlight, while his bodyguard looked on. Mao's protestations that he had only been talking to Lily cut no ice. Gui-yuan turned on Lily, scratching her face and pulling her hair, while Mao stood by.</p><p>但是对毛搞女人，子珍难以容忍。六月的一个晚间，史沬特莱听到子珍叫骂：“龟儿子，你胆敢跑来跟这个资产阶级臭婆娘睡觉！”史沫特莱跑去隔壁，看见子珍正用手电筒朝毛头上乱打，毛的警卫员在旁边不知所措。毛说他只是来跟吴小姐聊天的，子珍当然不信，转身冲向吴，抓脸扯头发，毛站在一边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gui-yuan then rounded on Smedley. “Imperialist bitch!” she cried. “You who are the cause of it all, get out of here!” She hit Smedley, who hit her back. Gui-yuan was felled to her knees, and appealed to Mao: “What kind of man are you, what kind of husband and Communist? You let an imperialist whore beat me before your very eyes!” When Mao told his bodyguard to lift her up, Gui-yuan tripped the bodyguard and knocked him down, and in the end it took three bodyguards to carry her off, trailed by a silent Mao.</p><p>子珍接着对史沫特莱喊：“帝国主义臭婆娘！都是你招来的，滚出去！”高头大马的史沫特莱朝她打去，把子珍打倒在地。子珍朝毛叫着：“你算个什么男人？什么丈夫？什么共产党员？你就看着帝国主义婊子打我？”毛叫警卫员把子珍抱起来，子珍把他也绊倒，最后三个警卫员把她硬抬走了，毛一言不发地跟在后边。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Smedley was soon sent packing. Lily was not simply banished from Yenan, but written out of Chinese Communist sources, and disappeared off the map forever.</p><p>不久史沫特莱离去，吴小姐不仅离开延安，而且从整个关于毛的中共着述中消失。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao conducted other flirtations, including one with the writer Ding Ling. Though boyish and stout and not exactly a beauty, she had talent and character. Mao sent her a very complimentary poem which included the lines: “To what do I compare your slender pen? Three thousand Mausers and best men.” She recalled in later years how she often visited Mao. One day he half-jokingly compared Yenan to a small imperial court, and started writing down his colleagues' names under the various imperial titles, which she shouted out to him. “After we finished this, he suddenly said to me: ‘Ding Ling, we have got the Hundred Civil and Military Courtiers sorted out. Now that we are a royal court, no matter how small, we've got to have the imperial concubines in Three Palaces and Six Courtyards! Come on, give me some names, and I will bestow titles on them.' ”</p><p>毛还跟作家丁玲调情。丁玲虽然长得圆墩墩地像个男孩子，谈不上什么姿色，但她有才气，有性格。毛写了首赞美她的词，有这样两句：“纤笔一支谁与似？三千毛瑟精兵。”她常去看毛，跟他说说笑笑。有一次，毛问她：“丁玲，你看咱们的延安像不像一个偏安的小朝廷？”毛接着要她报名单，由他封文武百宫。丁玲后来回忆道：“弄完了这个，他突然又对我说：“丁玲，现在文武百官有了，既然是个朝廷，那就无论大小，都得有三宫六院呀！来，来，你再报些名字，我来封赐……””</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Gui-yuan, Mao's flagrant womanizing was the last straw. Over their marriage of nearly ten years, she had had to live with her husband's heartlessness. She was particularly hurt by his callousness towards her painful pregnancies and childbirth—including one on the Long March—and by his crack that she gave birth to babies “as easily as a hen dropping eggs.” And she was bitter that although he was indifferent to children, and had not cared when four of theirs had died or been abandoned, he repeatedly made her pregnant. Their fifth child, a daughter called Chiao-chiao, was born in 1936 in Baoan, where conditions were appalling, with scorpions and rats running all over the place. A year later, Gui-yuan was pregnant again, which plunged her into depression. Repeated child-bearing in harsh circumstances had severely damaged her health, without the compensation of family life. Now, on top of this, her husband was openly sleeping with other women.</p><p>毛的艳事终于使子珍忍无可忍了。他们结婚快十年，十年里，她容忍了毛对她的漠不关心。使她尤其痛苦的是，毛不但不心疼她，让她在艰难的环境里不断怀孕生产，反倒开玩笑说她生孩子像母鸡下蛋一样容易。她也气愤毛对孩子早殇或送人都无所谓。他们的第五个孩子，女儿娇娇，一九三六年在保安出生，生在蝎子、耗子乱爬的窑洞里。不到一年，她又怀孕了，这使她万分苦恼。反覆怀孕生产损害了她的健康，却又没有带来家庭生活的乐趣。毛让她做出这些牺牲，自己却半公开地跟别的女人胡搞。子珍曾有过的离开毛的念头，此时在她心里再次萌发。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After the Communists settled in Yenan, some senior Reds who had been wounded were able to go to Russia for treatment. Ostensibly to get rid of the painful shrapnel still lodged in her body, Gui-yuan left for Russia in early October 1937. Their one-year-old daughter remained in Yenan.</p><p>中共在延安安顿下来后，受伤的高级干部有机会去苏联治疗。子珍以取出体内弹片为名，一九三七年十月初前往苏联。她把一岁的女儿娇娇留在延安。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Gui-yuan reached Moscow in the depths of winter. She and the other new arrivals were immediately warned by fellow Chinese there not to get in touch with anyone they had known previously. A great purge was sweeping Soviet Russia, and many Chinese were being arrested. It was in this freezing world of isolation and fear that she gave birth to a boy, to whom she gave the Russian name Lyova. He died of pneumonia after only six months, and Gui-yuan sank into inconsolable grief. For days she sat on a bench facing the tiny mound where he was buried in the back garden, murmuring his name, weeping.</p><p>到莫斯科时正值严冬。子珍一行马上被警告不要跟从前认识的人来往，莫斯科正在大清洗的浪潮中，一批批中国人被捕。就在这样一个充满恐惧的寒冷世界里，子珍生下一个男孩，她给他取了个俄国名字叫柳瓦。六个月后，孩子得肺炎死了。子珍悲痛欲绝，经常坐在埋葬这个小生命的土丘前的长凳上，久久地流着眼泪，低低地喊着他的名字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There was no warmth from her husband. When the baby was born, she had written to Mao to say that the boy looked just like him. Mao did not reply. No word either for his son's death. Then, in summer 1939, nearly two years after they had parted, Gui-yuan learned by chance that Mao had remarried. She and a group of non-Russian-speaking Chinese met regularly to have items from the Soviet press read out to them in Chinese. On this occasion, the translator was reading an article by a famous Russian film-maker, Roman Karmen, about meeting Mao. Karmen mentioned that Mao and “his wife” had seen him off outside their cave in moonlight. The phrase “Mao's wife,” so casually mentioned, set Gui-yuan's stomach churning. In the following days, people who shared a room with her said she was tossing and turning all night. She was already suffering from severe insomnia. Now she came to the brink of a nervous breakdown. Her condition worsened further when she received a brief letter from Mao. It was dry stuff: hope you will study hard and make progress politically. In one lapidary sentence Mao announced the dissolution of their marriage: From now on, we are only comrades.</p><p>孩子出世时，她写信给毛，说她生了个男孩，长得就像他。毛没有回信。孩子死了，毛也没有反应。一九三九年夏天，他们分离快两年了，一天，子珍跟不会说俄文的同伴一起听每周例行的读报。有篇文章是苏联电影导演卡门(Roman Karmen)写的毛泽东访问记。忽然，子珍听见读报员读到毛和“他的夫人”踏着月光在窑洞外送行。“毛的夫人”，这短短几个字，宛如一声霹雳，使子珍心里翻江倒海。随后几天，同室人发现她整夜翻来覆去，她本来就有失眠的毛病，现在更是彻夜不寐。不久，她收到毛的一封短信，信里是几句大道理：“希望你好好学习，政治上進步。” 然后一句简单生硬的官话结束了他们十年的婚姻：“我们以后就是同志了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Because he had remarried, Mao did not want Gui-yuan back in China. When the friends with whom she had traveled to Russia were returning to China in 1939, a cable from Yenan specifically ordered her to stay behind. As a result, the infant daughter she had left in Yenan spent her first few years as a virtual orphan. Chiao-chiao had had to live as a boarder in the elite's nursery. When the other children were taken home by their parents at the end of the day, nobody came for her. Later in life she recalled that there was also a boy who always stayed behind. He would cry and shout: “I want Papa! I want Mama! I want Home!” Chiao-chiao had no idea what these words meant. As a grown-up, she told a friend, quietly but not without an edge: “In those days, I was an ‘orphan' who was not exactly an orphan!”</p><p>毛已经再婚，不希望子珍回国。这年，当同子珍一块来苏联的朋友回国时，延安特别发电报命令把子珍留在苏联。这样一来，子珍走时留在延安的女儿娇娇依旧没有母亲，毛也不管她。娇娇在保育院里长大，其他孩子傍晚都有爸爸妈妈来接，但没有人来接她。娇娇记得还有个小男孩也没有人接，每次都大哭：“我要爸爸！我要妈妈！我要回家！”娇娇不懂这个男孩在叫什么，她没有爸爸妈妈和家的概念。长大以后，她一次对朋友平静但又不无哀伤地说：“那时，我是个不是孤儿的“孤儿”！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When she was four, Chiao-chiao was taken to Russia to join her mother. Gui-yuan hugged her daughter long and hard when they were reunited, in streams of tears, which made Chiao-chiao extremely happy. She was also fascinated by her mother's permed hair, skirts, and leather shoes with heels, all very different from the women in Yenan, who wore baggy pants and un-smart cotton shoes, attire that even those who came to Yenan from Nationalist cities had to adopt. But Gui-yuan was already crushed by poor health, the result of frequent pregnancies, injuries suffered during the Long March, and painful memories of her dead and abandoned children, as well as years of grinding loneliness. The horrors she had experienced in the revolution may also have haunted her mind. Soon she had a breakdown, and the brunt of her rage was borne by her daughter; other children often heard Chiao-chiao screaming as her mother beat her. Gui-yuan was put in a mental institution, howling as she was torn away from her room and bundled into a car. Her terrified seven-year-old daughter ran away and hid in the woods, and grew into an introverted and silent girl.</p><p>四岁那年娇娇被送到母亲身边。重逢时，子珍紧紧搂着女儿，眼泪在微笑里像泉水在阳光下一样闪亮。娇娇非常快乐，对妈妈的打扮她也感到新奇：子珍烫着一头卷发，穿着裙子和高跟皮鞋。娇娇在延安看见的阿姨们，穿的都是灰暗松垮的裤子，土气的布鞋。娇娇所不知的是，她的妈妈已经是身心交瘁。以后几年中，子珍精神逐渐崩溃，一腔怒气常常发泄在娇娇头上，院子里的孩子们经常听见娇娇挨打的哭喊声。子珍被强制送進精神病院。把她从屋子里拖走塞進汽车时，子珍撕心裂肺地嚎叫，吓得七岁的娇娇逃出去躲進树林里藏起来。娇娇长成一个内向沉默的姑娘。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>IN SUMMER 1937, before Gui-yuan left for Russia, Mao had spotted a young actress called Jiang Qing, who was to become his fourth wife. Jiang Qing cut a stylish figure even in Communist garb, her belt tightly cinching her svelte waist, and her rakishly tilted army cap exposing waves of shining black hair. She exuded femininity and sexiness. She had a soft and pliant posture and a very sweet—to some an affected—voice.</p><p>一九三七年夏天，子珍还没有到苏联时，毛就跟江青搞上了。江青是从上海来的年轻女演员。在延安，她能把共产党单调灰暗的制服也穿出味道来，皮带箍在苗条的腰上，军帽略歪着，露出半额光滑浓密的黑发。她的体态柔软依人，声音娇滴滴的，有时不免让人觉得做作。她浑身上下都是女人味。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Born in 1914, Jiang Qing was the daughter of a concubine to an alcoholic inn-owner. Her mother let her grow up willful, even allowing her to unbind her feet, after the bones had been broken when she was six. Jiang Qing was tough, and in the frequent fights between her parents she would help her mother by clinging to her father's legs and biting his arms. In one of these fights she lost part of a front tooth. Her fellow pupils recalled her as a bully, and she was expelled from school at the age of twelve after she spat at a teacher. She ran away from home at fourteen to join a traveling opera troupe, fetching up in Shanghai, where she made her name as an actress. But acting was a precarious career, and in summer 1937, out of work and unable to stand her lover's seven-year-old son, she came to Yenan, which also appealed to her radical chic side.</p><p>江青生于一九一四年，父亲是个客栈老板，母亲是他的妾。母亲由女儿任性长大，让她放了缠过的脚。江青从小性格倔强暴烈，爸爸经常酗酒打妈妈，她就帮妈妈去死命拉住爸爸的手脚，或者咬他的胳膊。就在一次这样的混战中，她失去了半颗门牙。她小时候的同学记得她喜欢无事生非捉弄人。十二岁时她把一口口水吐在老师脸上，被学校开除。十四岁时她从家里逃走，去参加京剧戏班子，辗转到了上海，在那里成为小有名气的演员。影剧是份不稳定的职业，一九三七年夏她被受雇的电影公司解聘。她又受不了同居男人有个七岁的儿子，于是到延安来碰运气了。当然，她也还有左倾的一面，来延安前就已是共产党员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She knew how to get herself noticed, sitting in the front row at Mao's lectures, and asking wide-eyed questions. One day, Mao came to a Peking opera—a genre he loved—in which she was starring. Afterwards, he went backstage and put his coat around her shoulders. Next day she went to Mao's place to return the coat, and stayed the night.</p><p>江青很懂得吸引男人的注意。毛泽东演讲时她坐在前排，眼睛睁得大大的，问些天真可爱的问题。一天，堪称戏迷的毛来看她主演的京剧，戏后他到后台把一件大衣披在她肩上。第二天她去还大衣，就在那里过了夜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The couple began to appear in public together. This caused a scandal, as she was a woman with a past. She had already been married to, or lived with, four men, and had left a trail in the Shanghai gossip columns. Her stormy relationship with one of her husbands had provided fodder for the tabloids, especially after he tried to commit suicide by gulping down a bottle of surgical spirit with crushed match heads in it.</p><p>他们出双入对在人前露面了，闹得延安满城风雨。江青已经跟四个男人结过婚或同居过，上海小报上常有她的绯闻，尤其是她跟上海滩文人唐纳的浪漫史。唐纳为她喝带火柴头的酒精，企图自杀，议论沸沸扬扬，都是责怪她的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If cosmopolitan Shanghai found her difficult to stomach, puritanical Yenan positively gagged. On top of that, there was also tremendous sympathy for the woman she supplanted. One of Gui-yuan's former Long March companions recalled: “The students in my college were all upset. Some wrote to Mao openly, some wrote secretly … I wrote three letters. They went roughly like this: Chairman Mao, we hope you won't marry Jiang Qing. [Gui-yuan] is in very poor health, and you have had five or six children together … Jiang Qing's reputation is pretty bad.”</p><p>像上海这样的大都市尚且难以容忍江青，清教徒式的延安就更是不知所措了。人们同情子珍。刘少奇那时的妻子谢飞，曾跟子珍一道长征，回忆说：“我们马列学院的学生全都不满意，气得跺脚，这么个女人！有的人公开写信[给毛]，有的人秘密写信，不敢落自己的名字。我写了三封。”“大意是这样的：毛主席，我们希望你不要和江青结婚。贺子珍身体又不好，你们又生过五、六个孩子，老夫老妻了，江青这个人在这里影响并不好，男女都骂她是妖精。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For the Party, there was a more serious concern. Jiang Qing had once been imprisoned by the Nationalists as a Communist suspect, and had got out by signing a recantation—an act that the Party considered as “betrayal.” Moreover, there were allegations that she had entertained her jailers by being their dinner—and even their bed—companion. Underground organizations in Shanghai and other areas wired Yenan with formal complaints that she was “unsuitable to marry Chairman Mao.” Nominal Party chief Lo Fu wrote to Mao with his own objections and those of many others. When Mao received the letter, he tore it up on the spot and announced to the messenger: “I will get married tomorrow. Everyone else can mind their own business!” Next day he gave a “wedding” banquet to two dozen of Yenan's elite, to which Lo Fu was not invited.</p><p>对党组织来说，江青还有更严重的问题：她進过国民党的监狱，写了“认罪书” 出狱。在共产党眼里这算叛党。人们还说她在监狱里为特务唱戏助酒，有的说她跟特务睡觉。上海等地区的地下党给延安发电报，正式提出“毛主席同她结婚很不合适”。张闻天综合意见给毛写了封信，说跟江青结婚，对党对你都不大好”。毛接到信后大怒，当场把信扯了说：“我明天就结婚，谁管得着！”第二天他摆婚宴两席，张闻天不在宾客之列。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao got security chief Kang Sheng to vouch for Jiang Qing. While working in Russia, Kang had been the escort for Mao's sons to Moscow, and for Chiang Kai-shek's son on his way out of Russia. He had come to Yenan in November 1937, and quickly attached himself to Mao, who made him the head of his KGB. In this world of yellow earth, Kang stood out as he was often dressed completely in black, from head (black cap) to toe (unusual leather riding boots). His horse was black, and he was frequently seen cuddling a black dog, which was about the only pet around. Although Kang had proof that Jiang Qing's conduct while in prison had been dubious, he provided Mao with an official verdict which cleared her by saying that “her past is no problem politically.” In fact, Mao knew that the charges were true, as he acknowledged near his death. But he did not care. He wanted her.</p><p>毛让康生出面为江青担保。康生一九三七年十一月从苏联回到延安，不久便成为毛的得力助手，中共克格勃头子。在延安的黄土地上，康生以他的一身黑装，给人们留下深刻印象：黑帽子、黑马皮靴，骑的马是黑的，还爱抱着一条黑狗。那时延安不兴养宠物，康生大约是唯一的例外。康生有凭据表明江青确实在国民党监狱里干了那些事，但他顺着毛的意思给了江一个“组织结论”，说她“历史上清白，政治无问题”。其实，毛八十一岁生日那天对周恩来讲，他早就知道江青有严重政治历史问题。他毫不在乎，他要她，这就够了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mrs. Mao number 4 was to become the notorious Mme Mao.</p><p>毛的第四任夫人江青后来以她的劣行举世闻名。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>*Before Ching-kuo left Russia, he was worked on by Stalin in person, as well as being subjected to a blitz of blandishments and threats by Dimitrov. Ching-kuo played along, cabling Dimitrov en route that: “All your instructions will be fulfillled.” When he reached Vladivostok he was taken to the KGB office, where he performed his last formal act of obeisance to Moscow, promising: “I will strictly follow Party discipline.”</p><p></p></div>
