<div class='layout'><p> 25 SUPREME PARTY LEADER AT LAST</p><p>25 当上中共的“斯大林”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> (1942–45   AGE 48–51)</p><p>1942～1945 年    48～51 岁</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MAO'S CAMPAIGN terrorized even the terrorizers like his deputy and main hatchet man, Kang Sheng. Shi Zhe observed that Kang was living in a state of deep fear of Mao in this period. Though Kang had helped concoct the charge of a vast spy ring in the CCP, it could rebound, as Kang himself had a murky background. Where and when he had joined the CCP was a mystery: he had no witness to the event, and the sponsors he named denied his claim. Many letters had reached Mao casting doubts on Kang, some saying he had buckled when arrested by the Nationalists. Most damning of all, Dimitrov (i.e., Stalin) condemned Kang to Mao in December 1943 as “dubious,” saying that Kang was “helping the enemy.” In fact, back in 1940, the Russians had urged that Kang be kept out of the leadership.</p><p>整风也使毛的盟友增加了对他的畏惧感。他的主要帮手康生在那段时间非常怕毛。康生也是地下党，他的背景复杂。什么时候、什么地方入党都不清不楚，他提的入党介绍人否认介绍过他。许多人给毛写信提出对康的怀疑，有人说他被捕叛变、出卖同志。最令康惶惶不安的是莫斯科的态度，季米特洛夫一九四三年十二月的电报对毛说康生“为敌人效劳”“很可疑”。这当然代表斯大林的意见。早在一九四0年，莫斯科就要中共把康生清除出领导圈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Far from being put off by Kang's murky past, Mao positively relished it. Like Stalin, who employed ex-Mensheviks like Vyshinsky, Mao used people's vulnerability as a way of giving himself a hold over subordinates. He kept Kang on as the chief of his KGB, in charge of vetting and condemning others. Kang remained in fear of Mao right up to his death in 1975; one of his last acts was to plead with Mao that he was “clean.”</p><p>康生全靠毛保他。毛不但不在乎康暧昧的过去，相反地，他要的就是康有这样的过去。毛喜欢有把柄可抓的人。在毛手心里康生一辈子都提心吊胆，一九七五年临死前不久，还一再向毛表白他“没有叛变”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao made full use of Kang's penchant for persecution and twisted personality. Kang had been in Moscow during the show trials and had participated in Stalin-type purging. He enjoyed watching people being stricken with terror at mass rallies, and liked to play with his victims' anguish. Like Stalin, who sometimes invited victims to his study for a last talk, Kang savored the pleasure of watching the condemned fall into the abyss at the very moment they thought they were safe. He was a sadist. One story he particularly liked telling was about a landlord in his home district who thrashed his farmhands with a whip made from asses' penises. Kang was also a voyeur. After one fifteen-year-old girl invented a story of how she had used her body for spying, he had her repeat it all over the region, while he listened again and again. One of Kang's closest bonds with Mao came from supplying him with erotica, and swapping lewd tales.</p><p>康生在苏联经历了斯大林的肃反，参加了清洗别人，他是个心理变态的迫害狂。康爱观赏群众大会上人吓得发抖的场面，爱玩弄手中的牺牲品。斯大林有时把将赴刑场的人召到办公室作最后谈话，康生呢，故意让受害者以为没事了，就在那如释重负的一刻把他打入万丈深渊。康喜欢讲他家乡的一个地主如何用驴鸡巴做鞭子抽打长工。一个十五岁的女学生编了套谎话，讲她如何用肉体诱惑男人，为国民党刺探情报，康生带着她到处去讲，自己津津有味地听了一遍又一遍。他还给毛提供淫书，跟毛交换猥亵的笑话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Kang later became a scapegoat for the Yenan Terror, but everything he did was on Mao's orders. Actually, during the campaign, Mao limited his power by making Party bosses in each unit—rather than Kang's KGB—responsible for designating and taking charge of most victims in their institution. In the future Communist China, there was to be no exact equivalent of the Soviet KGB.</p><p>康生后来成为延安恐怖的替罪羊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ANOTHER ASSOCIATE who was dealt a tremendous scare in the campaign was Liu Shao-chi. Not only did some of the organizations named as spy outfits come under his domain, but he had also been arrested by the Nationalists—in fact, several times, which qualified him to be a prime suspect as a possible turncoat. If he gave any cause for dissatisfaction, Mao could easily have him condemned as a spymaster. Liu had actually been against the terror campaign when he first came back to Yenan at the end of 1942; but after this brief flutter of distaste, Russian liaison Vladimirov described him as “changing his views rapidly,” and cozying up to Kang Sheng. Thereafter, Liu toed Mao's line, and played an ignominious role in the campaign.* As he was extremely able, Mao picked him to be his second-in-command, a position Liu held until his downfall in the Cultural Revolution in 1966.</p><p>另一个盟友刘少奇也领导过地下党，自己还被捕过几次。要是他不跟毛合作，毛可以很容易地把他打成特务头子。刘一九四二年底刚回延安时曾对整人表示不满，但很快他就感到了危机。孙平观察到，刘迅速改变了观点，开始讨好康生，对毛亦步亦趋。后来刘鼓励他手下的人，像蒋南翔，给中央写信批评延安整风，不过那已是在毛把恐怖收回口袋之后。一九五0年，刘对苏联大使罗申(Nikolai Roshchin)说，延安整风的方式是“不正当的，使大批同志受害”。由于刘有才干，又听话，毛在整风中提拔他做第二把手，直到文化大革命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>TWO WOMEN WHO were to become extremely powerful in the future entered the realm of persecution now: Mao's wife and the wife of the man who was to be his deputy in the Cultural Revolution, Lin Biao. Both women had come to Yenan through Party organizations that were being condemned as spy centers. One day in 1943, while Lin Biao was in Chongqing, his wife, Ye Qun, was tied onto a horse and dragged off into detention. Luckily for her, Lin Biao was someone who enjoyed a most uncommon crony relationship with Mao. When Lin returned to Yenan in July, he marched into the Party office dealing with his wife's case. “Fuck you!” he shouted, throwing his whip on the desk. “We fight wars at the front, and you screw my wife in the rear!” His wife was released, and given the all-clear. This brief experience of intense fear was the beginning of the sclerosis of the heart for Ye Qun. When she rose with her husband in the Cultural Revolution, she became a victimizer.</p><p>有两个在未来的中国权倾一时的女人，在延安整风中第一次尝到了被整和整人的滋味，这就是毛夫人江青和林彪的夫人叶群。两人都当过地下党，自然都有特务嫌疑。一九四三年的一天，林彪远在重庆，叶群被绑在马上拉去关押起来。但她很幸运，有个跟毛关系不一般的丈夫。林彪七月回延安，闯進审查他妻子的机关办公室，把马鞭子往桌子上一摔，喝斥道：“他妈的，老子在前线流血打仗，你们在后方搞我老婆。”机关赶紧放人，给叶群作了“政治历史清白”的结论。受审这一段时间虽短，给叶群的心灵留下永久的疤痕，是她铁石心肠的开端。文革中她也成为整人的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The later notorious Mme Mao, Jiang Qing, also learned terror during the Yenan campaign. She had been arrested by the Nationalists years before, and had got out of prison by recanting, and entertaining her jailers—and, according to Kang Sheng (later), sleeping with them. Her past had been a big issue in 1938, when Mao wanted to marry her. Now, although no one dared to denounce her, because she was Mao's wife, she lived in dread that somebody might, particularly as she too had to perform “self-examinations” and endure criticisms from others. She tried to hide by asking for sick leave, but unlike Lin Biao, who simply told his wife to stay at home, Mao ordered his wife to go back to her unit and experience the scare cycle. Although what she went through was nothing compared with the ordeal suffered by the vast majority, it was enough to make her live in fear about her past for the rest of her life. More than two decades later, when she acquired enormous power, this obsessive fear contributed to the imprisonment and death of many people who knew about her. Above all, Jiang Qing was afraid of her husband. Unlike her predecessor Gui-yuan, she never dared to make a scene about Mao's womanizing, much less to contemplate leaving him. Whatever squalid jobs he assigned her, she would do.</p><p>江青作为毛夫人当然没人敢指控她，但她寝食不安，怕有人说出什么话来。她还得跟别人一样写“思想检查”，忍受“批评与自我批评”。她想躲起来，称病请假。毛不是林彪，他不保护自己的老婆，反而命她搬進中央党校“接受党和群众的检查”。虽然时间不长，程度也远比别人轻，她已是终身惧怕毛了。不像贺子珍，江青从不敢对毛玩弄女人大发雷霆，更不用说离开毛。毛要她干什么她就干什么。她这种恐惧感导致二十多年后文革中许多人坐监死亡。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The terror campaign in Yenan also marked her debut at persecuting others, for which she developed a taste. Her first victim was her daughter's nineteen-year-old nanny, whom she got thrown into prison, as the nanny revealed fifty-five years later.</p><p>她学会了整人，对此还上了瘾，第一个牺牲品是女儿李讷十九岁的保姆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao and Jiang Qing had one child together, a daughter, Li Na, born on 3 August 1940. By the time Li Na was one and a half, she was on her third nanny, who came from a poor peasant family in Shanxi. The nanny's father had died humping goods across the freezing Yellow River for the Reds. She herself started making shoes for the Red Army from a young age, and was promoted to her district Communist bureaucracy. She and some other “reliable” women were then selected to be nannies for the leaders.</p><p>李讷是毛跟江青唯一的女儿，生于一九四0年八月三日。一岁半时来了第三任保姆。保姆出身在山西一个穷苦人家，父亲常年在黄河上来回浮水给八路军驮运东西，一个严冬死在黄河里。保姆从小就给八路军做鞋，由于人老实勤恳被提拔到区政府工作，后来跟其他本分可靠的女孩子一道被选为延安首长的保姆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After a health check and some training, she was taken on as the Maos' nanny and servant. One of her chores was to wash Mme Mao's hair. She described how Mme Mao would lose her temper if her hair was not washed exactly the way she wanted. One day in 1943, the nanny was suddenly summoned to appear in front of Mme Mao and two staff members. “You have come here with poison! Confess!” screamed Mme Mao. That night the nanny was taken to the prison in the Back Ravine behind Date Garden.</p><p>做了体检，受了训练，她到了毛家。活路之一是给江青洗头。她说江青“脾气大着呢”， 稍不合意就大发火，“吓得我不得了”。一天，她突然被叫到江青和毛身边的两个工作人员面前，江青朝她厉声大叫：“牛奶里有毒，你是坏人，来的时候就带来了毒药！你坦白！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She was accused of poisoning the Maos' milk, which came from their own specially guarded cow at the security apparatus' compound. What had happened was that Mme Mao developed diarrhea. After grilling the chef and the orderly, she told Kang Sheng she wanted the nanny imprisoned and interrogated.</p><p>在枣园有一头特别为毛家养的乳牛，由专人喂养和挤奶。江青那天泻肚子，怀疑是牛奶有问题，审了厨师跟勤务员以后审保姆。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In prison, the nanny shared a cave with a large number of other women. During the day, the main activity was spinning, with a very high quota, which she had to work flat out to fill. The regime had spotted that this was an ideal occupation for prisoners, as they were forced to be stationary, thus easy to guard, while being economically productive. The evenings were a time for interrogations, during which the nanny was copiously abused with remarks like: “Why don't you simply confess and get it over with, you shit-making machine!” During the night, guards poked their heads into the cave to watch against suicide and escape. After nine months she was released, but the gut-wrenching fear she experienced stayed with her forever.</p><p>当天晚上，保姆被押進枣园后沟的监狱，住在一孔挤满女犯的窑洞里。白天的工作是纺线，定额高得使她们一刻也不能闲。当局发现纺线是个绝妙的办法，被关押的人坐在那里一动也不动，便于管理，还创造了财富。晚上是审讯的时间，保姆受尽辱骂：“你为什么不坦白？坦白就完了，你这个造粪的机器！”夜里看守拿着灯笼，不时探头到各窑洞去看，提防自杀或逃跑。关了九个月，保姆被释放了，九个月里经历的恐惧伴随了她一辈子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>IT WAS THROUGH the Yenan Terror that Mao accomplished another most important goal: building up his own personality cult. People who lived through this period all remembered it as a turning point when they “firmly established in our minds that Chairman Mao is our only wise leader.” Till then it had been possible to admire Mao while having reservations about him, and to gossip about his marriage to Jiang Qing while still supporting him as the leader. When they were first told to “study” a Mao speech, many had responded with an audible groan: “the same old thing,” “can't be bothered to go over it again,” “too simplistic.” Quite a few had been reluctant to chant “Long live Chairman Mao.” One recalled thinking: “This was a slogan for emperors. Why are we doing this? I felt creepy and refused to shout it.” This kind of independent talk—and thinking—was killed off by the campaign, and the deification of Mao established. This worship had nothing to do with spontaneous popularity; it stemmed from terror.</p><p>正是靠整风，毛泽东树立起了对他的个人崇拜。人们在头脑里，确立了毛泽东思想的领导地位”，“认识了毛泽东思想是唯一正确的思想”。以前，大家可以既钦佩毛又说调侃他的话，既拥护他做领袖又对他跟江青的婚姻表示不满。学习毛的讲话时，不少人曾皱着眉头说：“还不是这一套！”“太粗浅，太容易了解。”好些人刚到延安时看不惯呼喊“毛主席万岁”，觉得“皇帝才喊万岁嘛，我们这是干什么？我感觉肉麻。”这一类言谈在运动以后都不复存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Every step in the construction of his cult was choreographed by Mao himself. He minutely controlled its main vehicle, Liberation Daily, using giant headlines like “Comrade Mao Tse-tung is the Saviour of the Chinese People!” And it was Mao who initiated the phenomenon of badges of his head, which he first issued to the elite during the campaign. In 1943 he got a huge head of himself carved in gold relief on the façade of a major auditorium. It was in that year that Mao's portraits were first printed en masse and sold to private homes, and that the Mao anthem, “The East Is Red,” became a household song.</p><p>个人崇拜的每一步骤都是毛本人亲自导演的，最重要的步骤都发生在“延安恐怖”最盛的一九四三年。这一年，毛亲手控制的《解放日报》连篇累牍地登着大字标题：“毛泽东同志是中国人民的大救星”。这一年，毛担任校长的中央党校大礼堂正上方镶嵌上他本人的金色浮雕头像。这一年，中央党校发给每个学员一枚毛像章，为后来人人必戴毛像章之始。这一年，毛的肖像大批印刷，卖给家家户户。这一年，着名的毛颂歌《东方红》要人人传唱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was also in 1943 that a later widely used expression, “Mao Tse-tung Thought,” first saw the light of day, in an article by the Red Prof, Wang Jia-xiang. Mao stage-managed this eulogy himself. The Red Prof's wife described how Mao dropped in one sunny day when the dates were green on the trees. After some banter about mah-jong, Mao asked her husband to write an article to commemorate the twenty-second anniversary of the Party that July, dropping heavy hints as to what it should say. Mao checked the final text and made it obligatory reading for all.</p><p>也是在这一年，“毛泽东思想”这一说法问世，首次出现在王稼祥的文章里。捉刀人其实是毛。王的妻子朱仲丽记得那是阳光灿烂的一天，新结的蜜枣绿绿地挂在树上。毛到她家来了，先说了些关于打麻将的俏皮话，然后叫她丈夫写篇文章纪念中共成立二十二周年。毛明确地说：“你以前和我交换过的那些意见，我看都可以写進去。”王稼祥心领神会，废寝忘食地写了这篇文章，中心是：“中国民族解放整个过程中-- 过去、现在与未来--的正确道路就是毛泽东同志的思想”，“毛泽东思想就是中国的马克思列宁主义”。写好后交给毛审阅，毛打电话答覆：“写得很好，准备叫《解放日报》发表。”发表后成了中共人人必须“学习”的文章。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Every day, at the interminable meetings, Mao's simplistic formula was hammered in: for everything wrong in the Party, blame others; for every success—himself. To achieve this end, history was rewritten, and indeed often stood on its head. The battle of Tucheng, the biggest disaster on the Long March, fought under Mao's command, was now cited as an example of what happened when the army “violated Mao Tse-tung's principles.” The first action against Japan, Pingxingguan, was credited to Mao, although it had been fought against his wishes. “Just make it clear to Party members and cadres that the leadership headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung is completely correct,” Mao instructed.*</p><p>在每天的会上，一个简单公式被反覆捶打進人们的脑子：只有跟着毛，才能无往而不胜。长征中最大的败仗土城之战，明明是毛指挥的，现在成了“违背了毛泽东的人民战争的战略战术原则”的结果。毛反对的平型关之役成了“贯彻毛主席“诱敌深入”等作战原则所取得的重大胜利”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>改写历史还有一段小插曲。一九四三年，延安出了本小册子《中国职工运动简史》， 作者是早巳被国民党枪毙的中共劳工领袖邓中夏。一九三0年原文完全没有提到毛。可是现在的新版里塞進去这么一句话：“一九二二年，湖南工人运动就在毛泽东同志的领导下，猛烈地开展了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>IN EARLY 1945 Mao was ready to convene the long-delayed Party congress and have himself inaugurated as the supreme leader of the CCP. The 7th Party Congress opened in Yenan on 23 April, seventeen years after the 6th, in 1928. Mao had been postponing it for years, to make sure he had absolute control.</p><p>个人崇拜树立起来了，名正言顺当中共领袖的时机成熟了。一九四五年四月二十三日，中共“七大”在延安召开，离上届“六大”整整十七年。毛把“七大”往后一推再推，以便滴水不漏地控制大会。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao had not only weeded the list of delegates with a fine-tooth comb, he had held most of them in virtual imprisonment for five years, and put them through the grinder of his long-drawn-out terror campaign. Of the original 500 or so delegates, half were victimized as spy suspects and suffered appallingly, with some committing suicide and others having mental breakdowns. Many were then dropped. Hundreds of new delegates were appointed, guaranteed loyal to Mao.</p><p>所有“七大”代表都经过反覆筛选，毛还把他们中的大多数关了五年。整风前有五百来名代表，半数被打成特务，自杀的、精神失常的难计其数。几百个新代表被选入，个个都保证听毛的话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The congress hall was dominated by a huge slogan hung over the platform: “March Forward under the Banner of Mao Tse-tung!” Mao was voted chairman of all three top bodies: the Central Committee, the Politburo and the Secretariat. For the first time since the founding of the Party, Mao formally, and publicly, became its head. It had taken him twenty-four years. It was an emotional moment for Mao, and, as always when his emotions were in play, self-pity was never far off. As he raked over his tale of woes, he was on the verge of tears.</p><p>“七大”会堂最醒目之处，是主席台上方的一条大横幅：“在毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前進！”毛被选为所有最高机构--中央委员会、政治局、书记处--主席。自中共诞生以来，他第一次公开地有了党的领袖头衔。二十四年的努力如今总算开花结果，如愿以偿，毛的激动可想而知。感情冲动时他容易顾影自怜，他又开始唠叨过去的“受歧视”，“坐冷板凳”，眼泪直在眼眶里打转。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao Tse-tung had become the Stalin of the CCP.</p><p>毛泽东成了中共的“斯大林”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>*Later, Liu encouraged some cadres to speak up against the terror, but not until it was over in 1945. In 1950 he told Soviet ambassador Nikolai Roshchin that its methods were “perversions which cost a great number of victims.”</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>*In 1943, a booklet was published in Yenan, entitled A Brief History of China's Labour Movement, written by Deng Zhong-xia, a labor leader executed by the Nationalists. The original text had been published in 1930 in Russia, and contained no mention of Mao's role. Now a passage was inserted: “In 1922, thanks to the leadership of comrade Mao Tse-tung, the workers' movement in Hunan developed stormily …”</p><p></p></div>
