<div class='layout'><p> 39 KILLING THE “HUNDRED FLOWERS”</p><p>39 杀鸡儆猴的反右派运动</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> (1957–58   AGE 63–64)</p><p>1957～1958 年    63～64 岁</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>TERRORIZATION HAD always been Mao's panacea whenever he wanted to achieve anything. But in 1956, after Khrushchev condemned Stalin's use of terror, Mao had to lower the rate of arrests and killings. On 29 February, as soon as he learned about Khrushchev's secret speech, Mao had ordered his police chief to revise established plans: “This year the number of arrests must be greatly reduced from last year … The number of executions especially must be fewer …”</p><p>毛泽东向来的做法是用恐怖开道。从莫斯科回来后，他感到要使他的军事工业化得以腾飞，必须再度祭起恐怖的法宝，把所有可能的、潜在的批评声音打哑，从上到下消除一切障碍。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But when Khrushchev's tanks rolled into Hungary later that year, Mao saw his chance to revive persecution. His colleagues were still saying that the troubles in Eastern Europe were the result of over-concentration on heavy industry and neglecting living standards. Liu Shao-chi argued that China should go “slower” with industrialization, so that “people won't be going onto the streets to demonstrate … and moreover will be fairly happy.” Chou, too, wanted to scrap some arms factories. Although wholly in agreement with Mao over giving priority to nuclear weapons, he remarked pointedly: “We can't eat cannons, or guns.”</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao's view of the “lessons from Eastern Europe” was completely different. “In Hungary,” he told his top echelon on 15 November, “it's true the standard of living did not improve much, but it wasn't too bad. And yet … there were great troubles there.” “The basic problem with some Eastern European countries,” he said, “is that they didn't eliminate all those counter-revolutionaries … Now they are eating their own bitter fruit.” “Eastern Europe just didn't kill on a grand scale.” “We must kill,” Mao declared. “And we say it's good to kill.”</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But with the trend in the Communist world blowing towards de-Stalinization, Mao decided it was not wise to be too blatant about launching a purge. To create a justification, he cooked up a devious plan. He did so mainly while lying in bed, where he spent most of his time that winter of 1956–57. He ate in bed, sitting on the edge, and only got up to go to the toilet.</p><p>选什么样的人当牺牲品，以什么藉口来清洗他们，是毛那年冬天反覆思考的问题。他整天半躺在床上，吃饭坐在床沿，起床只是去上厕所。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ON 27 FEBRUARY 1957, Mao delivered a four-hour speech to the rubber-stamp Supreme Council announcing that he was inviting criticisms of the Communist Party. The Party, he said, needed to be accountable and “under supervision.” He sounded reasonable, criticizing Stalin for his “excessive” purges, and giving the impression there were going to be no more of these in China. In this context, he cited an adage, “Let a hundred flowers bloom.”</p><p>毛选中了知识分子。传统上他们是民族的声音。迄今为止，毛让他们过比普通老百姓优裕的生活。有名的、有成就的，待遇甚至优于中共高干。只是他们失去了表达思想的自由，不停地被迫搞“思想改造”， 接受强制性的精神折磨。毛说：“有些外国人说，我们的思想改造是洗脑筋。我看也说得对，就是洗脑筋嘛！”洗脑还不算，他们在接二连三的政治运动中备受打击。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>知识分子中，首当其冲是民盟等“民主党派”的成员。为了摆样子，毛允许这些人在政府内任职，甚至国务院部长一类的高职。他们有头脑，有影响力，有一般人得不到的资讯，还有中国知识分子为民请命的传统。他们的批评声音一向使毛很不舒服，在内部骂他们是“历史上包下来的一批王八蛋”，说：“每年召开人民代表大会，政协会议，总是要对付他们一场。通过法案，他们都举手，下去视察就找岔子”。“一个是法制，一个是农民苦，一个是没肉吃。总的是社会主义有没有优越性。”毛要把他们清除出去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>这些人同中共高层如周恩来，有千丝万缕的联系。整他们可以起敲山震虎的作用。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Few guessed that Mao was setting a trap, and that he was inviting people to speak out so that he could then use what they said as an excuse to victimize them. Mao's targets were intellectuals and the educated, the people most likely to speak up. After taking power, Mao's policy had been to give them a generally better standard of living than the average. Those who were well-known or “useful” were given special privileges. But Mao had them put through the grinder several times, not least with “thought reform,” which he himself described as brainwashing: “Some foreigners say our thought reform is brainwashing. I think that's right, it is exactly brainwashing.” In fact, even the fearsome term “brainwashing” does not conjure up the mental anguish of the process, which bent and twisted people's minds. Now Mao was planning to persecute the educated en masse.</p><p>为了整这批人，毛设了个陷阱。一九五七年二月二十七日，毛在民主党派人士众多的最高国务会议上讲了四个小时的话。他显得通情达理，批评斯大林“杀错了很多人”，给人印象是中共将来不会再杀人了。他借用成语，说中国要“百花齐放，百家争鸣”， 要人们起来批评共产党，监督共产党，帮共产党“整风”。讲话录音事后专门放给不在场的民主党派人士听。三月一日，毛再次对他们讲话，请他们批评中共，特别声明“言者无罪”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao confided his scheme only to a very few special cronies like the boss of Shanghai, Ke Qing-shi, keeping even most of the Politburo in the dark. In early April, he told these few cronies that as a result of him soliciting criticisms, “intellectuals are beginning to … change their mood from cautious to more open … One day punishment will come down on their heads … We want to let them speak out. You must stiffen your scalps and let them attack!… Let all those ox devils and snake demons … curse us for a few months.” To these same few cronies, Mao spelled out that he was “casting a long line to bait big fish.” He later described his ensnaring like this: “How can we catch the snakes if we don't let them out of their lairs? We wanted those sons-of-turtles [bastards] to wriggle out and sing and fart … that way we can catch them.”</p><p>没人猜到毛鼓励人们畅所欲言，是为了用他们说的话作藉口镇压他们。这个意图，毛只透露给了少数几个亲信，其中有上海地区的负责人柯庆施。四月初，毛在杭州对这些人说，他欢迎批评共产党的讲话，已使知识分子“犹豫情绪变得比较开朗”，开始“鸣放”了。他说：“鸣好鸣坏由他们自己负责，反正总有一天要整到自己头上来。”“我们要放，要硬着头皮，让他们攻！”“让牛鬼蛇神都出来闹一闹……让他们骂几个月。”毛说他是在“放长线钓大鱼”。他后来还用过类似的字眼来形容他的策略：“蛇不让它出来怎么能捉它，我们要叫那些王八蛋出现唱戏，在报纸上放屁，长长他们的志气”，“我们是一逼一捉”。“引蛇出洞”是对毛的阴谋的贴切描述。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Mao's trap was extremely successful. Once the lid was loosened just a fraction, a deluge of dissent burst out, mostly in wall posters and small-scale meetings called “seminars,” which were the only forums allowed.</p><p>毛的陷阱设得很成功。一旦高压的盖子稍稍松动，对共产党的不满就像潮水一样涌出，倾泻在两个特许的场地上：大字报和座谈会。这两种方式不像印刷品发行面广，影响面大，只局限在小范围内。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>北京大学的第一批大字报里，有沈泽宜，张元勋的一首诗：{是时候了)。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>是时候了，</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p></p><p>今天，我要鸣起心里的歌，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>作为一支巨鞭，</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p></p><p>为什么，你和我不敢坦率地交谈？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>为什么……？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>我含着愤怒的泪，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>向我辈呼唤：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>歌唱真理的弟兄们</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>快将火炬举起</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>为火葬阳光下的一切黑暗！！！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One of the very first things to be challenged was the Communists' monopoly of power, which one critic described as “the source of all ills.” One poster was entitled “Totalitarian power is peril!” The Communists' exercise of power was compared to Hitler's. One man said in a seminar that “in not protecting citizens' rights, today's government is worse than the feudal dynasties or Chiang Kai-shek.” One professor called the Constitution “toilet paper.” Another, an economist, went right to the core of Mao's methods, and called for banning public denunciations, “which are much worse than being in prison”—“just the thought of them makes one tremble from heart to flesh.” Democracy was the popular demand.</p><p>尖锐的矛头直指共产党专制制度的，有王书瑶的大字报：“斯大林错误的原因是什么呢？是因为他骄傲了。但是他可以破坏法制、進行独裁、進行疯狂地屠杀的保证又是什么呢？” 他认为，无论是苏共还是中共都“害怕说出问题的原因，是由于共产党对国家政权的绝对控制，国家权力的高度集中。” 张锡锟把中共统治比作“希特勒统治”。数不尽的抨击中还有这样一些话：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“现在的政府不保护公民权利的状况，还不如封建王朝和蒋介石。” “宪法自一九五四年通过以后，有的被彻底破坏了，有的有名无实”，“把宪法当作手纸”。“亲身经历过三反、五反、肃反这些运动的人，想起来就感到心惊肉缩，毛骨悚然。”“真是人人自危，社会大恐怖。”“斗的场面，比坐牢难受多了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“民主化”是人们充满激情的要求。岑超南一针见血地写道：“毛主席说：发扬民主，鼓励批评，只有理论价值罢了，当人民的公民权利在实质上还没有保证的时候，当打击、报复、暗害盛行时，批评者地位没有保障时，当你的命运还被掌握在领导的手里时，鼓励批评，不过是对批评的讽刺。”“要真正整风，首先要把一切不民主的制度一扫而空！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So was the rule of law. One vice-minister called for the independence of the judiciary. Another administrator said he wanted to be able “just to follow the law, not the orders of the Party.” Referring to the CCP's smothering methods of controlling everything, one well-known playwright asked: “Why is it necessary to have ‘leadership' in the arts? Who led Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Beethoven, Molière?”</p><p>“法制”与民主连在一起。监察部副部长王翰要求司法部门独立于中共领导：“监察机关从属于谁，就不能监察谁”。最高人民法院刑事审判庭庭长贾潜说：“政治是政治，法律是法律，我们是司法不是司政策”，“审判员只需服从法律，再不必有什么党的领导了。”着名剧作家吴祖光问：“对于文艺工作者的“领导”又有什么必要呢？谁能告诉我，过去是谁领导屈原的？谁领导李白、杜甫、关汉卿、曹雪芹、鲁迅？谁领导莎士比亚、托尔斯泰、贝多芬和莫里哀的？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Foreign policy, too, came in for questioning by some of the elite who had access to partial information. The former Nationalist governor of Yunnan province, who had crossed over to the Communists, protested that “it is unfair that China should pay all the costs in the Korean War”—and called for reducing the level of aid being lavished on foreign countries.</p><p>中共最讳莫如深的外交政策也不乏人批评。国民党时期的云南省长、中共同路人龙云说“抗美援朝战争的经费，全部由中国负担很不合理”，主张压缩对外援助。略知内情的人把大把撒钱的援外叫作“打肿脸充胖子”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The regime's secretiveness also came under attack. “All absolute economic statistics are state secrets,” protested one critic, “even the output of alkali … What is this but an attempt to keep people in a state of stupidity?” He demanded information about the industrialization program. Another wrote: “I have indeed heard about peasants … dying from having just grass roots to eat, in areas so rich in produce that they are known as the land of fish and rice. But the newspapers say nothing about any of this …”</p><p>政权毫无透明度，人民毫无知情权，被谴责为“有意识地愚民”。北大的呵欠伯这样结束他的大字报：“在鱼米之乡吃南瓜而肚子胀，吃草根而饿死农民的消息，确有所闻，报上却只字未见，岂不引人深思。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Many contrasted the harsh life of the peasants with that of the leaders (which they could only glimpse). People's Daily had reported a banquet for the Russian president Kliment Voroshilov, attended by 1,000 people. “Why such grandeur?,” one poster enquired, when “ ‘local Party emperors' are using methods like abuse, torture and detention to gouge food out of the peasants …?” “We must know that dissatisfied peasants could throw Chairman Mao's portrait into the toilet,” this daring author warned.</p><p>为农民呼吁的人尤其多。朱庆圻从报上看到政府经常举行盛大宴会，为了欢迎苏联国家主席伏罗希洛夫，曾举行上千人的盛大酒会，他问道：“既然我们公开承认我国人多经济落后，实行公开的统购统销政策，宣传要勤俭办社、勤俭办国，为什么还要这样大摆国际场面？”特别是在农村出现了“党员土皇帝”的称号，甚至采用打骂、禁闭等方式强迫农民卖余粮”。这位勇敢的作者警告说：“要知道农民由于对统购统销施行的不满是会将毛主席的像丢在厕所内的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Most of this criticism never reached the general public, as Mao only allowed carefully selected snippets to appear in the press. The rest was confined to the two channels—seminars and wall posters—which were impermanent and easy to erase. And Mao made sure that these outlets were restricted to isolated campuses and individual institutions, to which the general public was not allowed access. Nor were these institutions permitted to contact each other, and people inside them were banned from going outside to spread their views. When some students tried to distribute handwritten journals, their samizdats were instantly confiscated, and they were punished as “counter-revolutionaries.” Dissent was thus kept rigidly fragmented, so a popular uprising was impossible.</p><p>这些盛开的百花中，一般民众只能看到少数被掐头去尾的几朵。毛泽东非常仔细地掌握着什么可以在报上发表，指示说：“机关学校出大字报的消息，报纸不应登载”。毛格外强调不准串联，说：“反动分子将到本机关本学校以外的工厂学校去活动，要预作布置，实行挡驾。”学生们出的刊物被宣布为“反动刊物”，编辑受到“逮捕和法办”的威胁。由于严密的控制，中国的百花无论怎样合民意，在大地上都只是脆弱分割的斑斑点点，不可能开成一片，不可能对毛的政权造成任何像匈牙利事件那样的威胁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>ON 6 JUNE 1957, Mao read a mimeographed pamphlet which speculated that the leadership was split, with himself cast as the champion of dissent, ranged against “conservatives.” In the information void he had created, some had mistakenly come to think that he was a liberal, and appeals had been heard like: “Let us unite around Mao Tse-tung–Khrushchev!” Some even expressed concern for Mao: “It seems our dear comrade Mao Tse-tung is in a very difficult position.” This suggestion that Mao was a liberal was dangerous for him, because it could well embolden dissent.</p><p>六月六日，毛读到一份内部简报，上面说北京大学某学生写了篇题为《我的忧虑和呼吁》的文章，说党中央开始分裂，毛是主张“鸣放”的，遭到中共党内保守势力的反击，有人想逼毛下台。毛封锁讯息的结果竟使他被误会成了自由派的先驱。北大有人大声疾呼要大家“团结在毛泽东--赫鲁晓夫的周围”，还有人天真而充满感情地写道：“看来我们亲爱的毛泽东同志处在十分困难的地位……”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>毛在内部简报上批语说：“完全造谣，但值得注意。”幻想有毛的支持会使人们更大胆，采取更多的方式反抗。毛决定“引蛇出洞”立即停止。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The next day, Mao ordered an editorial for People's Daily to be broadcast that evening, saying that challenging the Party was forbidden. Once he pressed this button, the persecution machine started rolling for what was called the “Anti-Rightist Campaign,” which lasted a year. The brief exciting moment of “a hundred flowers” was over.</p><p>第二天，毛以《人民日报》社论的形式发动了反右派运动，说右派正在向共产党挑战，要共产党下台。中共的镇压机器就此启动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On 12 June, Mao issued a circular to the Party, to be read to all members “except unreliable ones,” in which he made it explicit that he had set a trap. He did not want his Party to think he was a liberal—in case they themselves should turn liberal.</p><p>六月十二日，毛把一份他亲自署名的通知(事情正在起变化)印发全党，除了“党内不可靠的人”。他把写文章的时间定为五月十五日，在文章里说，他迄今为止搞的都是“钓鱼，或者说：诱敌深入，聚而歼之。”毛不能让他的党以为他是自由派，那样他们也会自由派起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In this circular, Mao set a quota for victims: between 1 and 10 percent of “intellectuals” (which meant the better-educated), who numbered some 5 million at the time. As a result, at least 550,000-plus people were labeled as “Rightists.” While many had spoken out, some had not said anything against the regime, and were pulled in just to fill Mao's quota.</p><p>在这份通知里，毛把右派的人数定为知识分子的百分之一到百分之十。结果，中国五百万知识分子中，至少五十五万被划为“右派”。他们中也有什么“反党”的话都没说的，硬戴上帽子来填比例。毛痛恨的民主党派人士被一网打尽，包括民盟负责人交通部长章伯钧、森林工业部长罗龙基。就像把不搭界的高岗、饶漱石拉在一起打成“高饶反党集团”一样，毛硬把冤家对头的章伯钧、罗龙基凑成“章罗联盟”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To Mao, writers, artists and historians were superfluous. Scientists and technicians, however, were largely exempted from persecution—“especially those who have major achievements,” a September 1957 order decreed; these “must be absolutely protected.” Scientists who had returned from Europe and America, in particular, were to be “neither labelled nor denounced.” Nuclear physicists and rocket scientists were treated extra well. (Throughout Mao's reign, top scientists were given privileges superior even to those enjoyed by very senior officials.)</p><p>毛需要知识分子。但是搞政治的，搞社会科学的如作家、艺术家、历史学家，毛不需要。他要的是科学家、技术人才。九月八日，中共特别发了一个《关于自然科学方面反右派斗争的指示》：“要区别社会科学和自然科学的不同情况，区别对待。特别是对于那些有重大成就的自然科学家和技术工作人员，除个别情节严重非划不可者外，应一律采取坚决保护过关的方针。”“对有较高科学成就的，不可轻易划为右派，必须划的，也应“斗而不狠”；对有的人，“谈而不斗”。”“对在日内瓦会议后争取回国的欧美留学生，一般要“不划不斗”。”为毛搞核武器的更是备受优待。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As the ultimate aim of this crackdown was to create the atmosphere for harsher extraction to finance the Superpower Program, Mao made a particular point of hammering any challenge directed against his policies towards the peasantry. One People's Daily headline screamed: “Rebuke the rubbish that ‘peasants' lives are hard!' ” To drive home his message, Mao personally arranged a piece of sadistic theater. One well-known figure had been saying that peasants were “on the verge of dying from starvation,” so a “fact-finding” tour was arranged for him. People's Daily reported that wherever he went he was pursued by crowds up to 50,000 strong, “refuting his rubbish,” and was finally forced to flee, hidden under jute sacks in the boot of a car.</p><p>毛着重打击的是为农民仗义执言的人。《人民日报》连篇累牍地，驳斥“农民生活苦”的无耻谰言”。龙云的罪名之一是“强调这里饿死人，那里饿死人。”孙中山大本营军需总局局长罗翼群曾说农民“接近饿死的边缘”。他所在的广东省组织了一场二十多天的农村“视察”， 让他吃够了苦头，由《人民日报》跟踪报导。“每天，他只要一出门，就有几百人甚至几千人围上来”。一天，他的去路“被几万愤怒的群众挤得水泄不通，连汽车都上不去。大家高呼，要继续和罗翼群辩理，有人恨得想用伞柄戳他……一路上，沿街店户的商人、店员、小贩也都围上来，痛骂罗翼群。”车身上贴满了诅咒他的标语。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Parallel with theater came executions. Mao revealed later to his top echelon that one province, Hunan, “denounced 100,000, arrested 10,000 and killed 1,000. The other provinces did the same. So our problems were solved.”</p><p>毛的手段既有闹剧，也有杀人。毛后来对中共高层说他如何“开捉戒，开杀戒，湖南斗十万，捉一万，杀一千，别的省也一样，问题就解决了”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A particular example was made of three teachers in one county town in Hubei province who were executed for allegedly stirring up a demonstration by schoolchildren over education cuts. The effect of the cuts was that only one in twenty children would now be able to go on to high school. The demonstration was branded “a Little Hungary,” and a special point was made of publicizing the executions nationwide. It is almost certain that Mao personally ordered the death sentences, as he had just arrived in the province the day before they were passed, and up till that moment the authorities had been undecided about imposing the death penalty. The huge publicity was intended to instill fear in rural schools, which bore the brunt of the education cuts Mao had introduced to squeeze out more funds for the Superpower Program.</p><p>杀人是为了杀一儆百。湖北省汉阳县的三名教师、图书管理员为此倒在刑场上。他们的罪名是煽动汉阳一中的学生闹事。这个县城的初中生罢课并上街游行，抗议教育经费又要缩减，严重影响农村，“二十个初中毕业生中，只有一个能升入高中”。他们要求扩大招生比例，缩小城乡招生差别。这一事件被定性为“小匈牙利事件”， 全国报纸都刊登了对他们的死刑判决。可以肯定，死刑是毛泽东一锤定音，他在宣布死刑的头一天(九月五日)到达武汉。他来之前，当地法院对是否判死刑意见不一。毛政权把少得可怜的教育经费集中在城市里，特别是“重点学校”，主要培养一小部分从事科学和其他“有用”科目的人才。广大农民的孩子能认几个字就行。给县城学校，国家好歹还投一点钱，村子里的小学几乎分文没有。农家子弟受高等教育的机会微乎其微。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Funding for education was already minuscule. Now it was to be cut back even further. Mao's approach was not to raise the general standard of education in society as a whole, but to focus on a small elite, predominantly in science and other “useful” subjects, and leave the rest of the population to be illiterate or semi-illiterate slave-laborers. What funds were allotted to education went mainly to the cities; village schools received no funding, and schools in small towns very little. As a result, only tiny numbers of rural youth were able to go on to higher education.</p><p>即使在城市里，一九五七年的教育经费也受到一次大削减。五百万高小毕业生中，百分之八十不能升学。而一百万初中生中的八十万毕业后不能上高中。“小匈牙利事件”的镇压就是为了防备愤怒的星星之火形成燎原烈焰。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even in the cities, young people's chances of education were drastically slashed in 1957, when 80 percent of the 5 million urban elementary school leavers (i.e., 4 million people) and 800,000 of 1 million middle-school leavers were told that they could not continue their education. There had been widespread discontent in the cities, and the executions of the teachers in the “Little Hungary” case were a warning to urbanites too.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Execution was not the only cause of death in this campaign: suicides were rife among those condemned as “Rightists.” In the Summer Palace in Peking, early morning exercise-takers frequently encountered corpses hanging from trees, and feet sticking out of the lake.</p><p>反右运动中枪毙的不少，自杀的更多。住在颐和园里的人早上起来散步，经常会看到树上吊着一两个人，还有跳湖自杀的，身体插入湖底淤泥里，两只脚露出水面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Most of those branded as “Rightists” were put through hellish, though largely non-violent, denunciation meetings. Their families became outcasts, their spouses were shunted to undesirable jobs, and their children lost all hope of a decent education. To protect their children—and themselves—many people divorced their spouses when they were labeled as Rightists. Numerous families were broken up, causing lifelong tragedy to children and parents alike.</p><p>大部分右派都经历了斗争大会，尽管没有拳打脚踢，横眉瞪眼的辱骂也难以忍受。他们的家庭从此成了贱民。为了保护孩子，也为了保护自己，许多人跟右派离了婚。无数家庭就这么拆散了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After they were denounced, most Rightists were deported to do hard labor in remote areas. Mao needed labor, particularly to open up virgin lands. A journalist called Dai Huang described how deportees were just dumped in places like the far north of Manchuria, known as “the Great Northern Wilderness,” and had to rig up a shelter “in a hurry, using wheat stems to make a roof” in a temperature of–38°C. Even with a fire, “it was still a dozen or so degrees below zero …”</p><p>多数右派被遣送到边远的地方做苦工。毛需要劳动力去开垦处女地。新华社记者戴煌后来描述他在北大荒的日子：摄氏零下三十八度的天寒地冻，他们一百多人睡在一间自己匆匆搭起的大窝棚里，麦秆儿苫顶，“窝棚内生了地塘火，也是“火烤胸前暖，风吹背后寒”的零下十几度，许多人只得穿着鞋和衣而卧。”“窝头、玉米渣子、黑面膜虽管够，但菜极少，有时只有几粒黄豆咸菜，甚至连盐都缺少。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The grass and beaten earth huts we lived in had wind coming in from all sides … there were hardly any vegetables or meat … We got up … just after 4 at dawn, and did not stop until 7 or 8 in the evening … In these 15–16 hours … we basically worked non-stop … in summer … We had to get up at 2 am … We had at most three hours' sleep.</p><p>我们每天早晨四点多钟就起来，直到晚上七、八点钟才休息，是地地道道的“日出而作，日落而息”。在这十五、六个小时内，除了吃三顿饭和洗脸洗脚的时间外，基本上都是在不停顿地劳动，要抽空儿写封信或洗件衣服，简直就成了一件十分困难的“任务”。很多人不得不带着一些硬纸头，工间一有小歇就把硬纸头放在膝盖上写起来，一封信往往要写好几次才草草写完。脏衣服和泥袜子只好堆在屋外墙脚下，洗澡更成了一大奢望。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While being subjected to ceaseless, relentless harangues—“You're here to redeem your crime! Don't dare to make trouble, or look for ways to be lazy!”—the deportees had to work on less than subsistence-level rations. Many died from malnutrition, illness, cold, overwork and in accidents doing unfamiliar jobs like felling trees.</p><p>苦工的内容，像在原始森林里伐木，是右派们从来没干过的，锯树中被砸死、砍伤的不计其数。一边干，一边还要听“奴隶主对待奴隶般的训斥”：“你们不要忘记你们是来劳动改造、认罪服法的！你们可不要调皮捣蛋、偷奸要滑！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This journalist, Dai, had actually spoken up after he knew that Mao had set a trap. He wrote a petition to Mao, objecting to “the new ruling class” holding sumptuous “receptions and banquets,” while “tens of thousands of people … are chewing grass roots or tree bark.” He even took a swipe at Mao's personality cult. “A chef cooking a good meal is said to be ‘thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership.' ” “Don't think you are a wise god,” he warned Mao.</p><p>戴煌，这位把北大荒栩栩如生留给后世的记者，是在知道毛泽东搞“引蛇出洞” 后挺身而出的。他感到“骨鲠在喉，非吐不可”，给毛写了一封长信，说：中共特权阶级正在全国各地形成和发展中。在这个新特权阶级举行着大大小小、形形色色的宴会和酒会时，“数以万千计的灾民在啃着草根树皮呢！”戴煌反对对毛的神化：“在我们国家里，做了一件什么好事，或完成了什么工程，都要向人民说这是“党的英明”、“毛主席的领导”； 甚至连炊事员做好了饭，也要说这是由于“毛主席的领导”。”这个勇敢的人警告毛：“不要自负为英明的神吧！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dai Huang's wife divorced him, and his relatives suffered discrimination. A schoolteacher nephew was denied funds for a life-saving operation because of the family connection. Dai himself barely survived the Northern Wilderness, from which many were never to return.</p><p>戴煌的妻子跟他离了婚，全家都受到牵连，“我的一个正在小学执教的年方二十岁的侄儿，患了心尖瓣狭窄症，公家只要出二百元给他动了手术，就可以挽救这条年轻的生命，但有人说他是我这个大右派的侄儿，他本人又尚未被转正，就眼睁睁地看着他死去了”。戴煌自己九死一生，从北大荒活着回来了。他还算幸运，无数中华民族的精英永远地长眠在那遥远的流放之地。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>HAVING SUPPRESSED dissent among the educated in general, starting in 1958, immediately after returning from the Moscow summit, Mao moved to strike fear into his top echelon by threatening to label as “Rightists” any of them who opposed the relaunch of the Superpower Program. His main concern was with his Nos. 2 and 3, Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai, who had championed the cuts in the Program in 1956.</p><p>封杀了知识分子反对的声音，毛泽东集中精力对付中共领导中他认为拖了他军事工业化后腿的人。首先是左右手刘少奇和周恩来。毛的策略是“打周儆刘”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The tactic Mao chose this time was new—to abase his most senior colleagues in front of dozens of provincial chiefs. This was the first time that Mao involved these second-rank officials in directly attacking his top colleagues and their own superiors. It was a means both of humiliating Chou and Liu, and of putting pressure on them; especially as Mao personally delivered stinging assaults on his two colleagues in front of their subordinates. Bringing in these provincial chiefs to witness the working of power at the very top—and the humiliation of the regime's Nos. 2 and 3—was also a way for Mao to empower the men responsible for supervising the actual collection of the food.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He focused on Chou, who was in charge of planning and administering the Program. Mao described Chou as being “only 50 metres away from being a Rightist”; Chou's attempts to curb investment in arms industries in 1956, Mao said, were on a par with the Hungarian Uprising, and had “considerably influenced the Rightists.” These were ominous charges, carrying the direst potential consequences. To make things even more menacing, Mao removed Chou as foreign minister in February 1958, and senior diplomats close to Chou were encouraged to attack him.</p><p>一九五八年初，毛在杭州、南宁、成都，开了三次由他唱主角，地方大员唱配角的会议。会上他指斥周“到和右派差不多的边缘，只剩了五十米了”。毛把周一九五六年缩减重工业建设规模的“反冒進”，跟“匈牙利事件”相提并论，说：“这两件事，都给右派猖狂進攻以相当的影响”。周不得不一次次作检讨。毛在二月分解除了周外交部长的职务，当即传出周行将垮台的风声，外交部的高级干部受到鼓励公开批周。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The heat around Mao was unbearable, even by the usual nerve-racking standards of his regime. One minister who had been in the firing line had a fatal breakdown. When Mao's doctor went to give the minister a check-up, he found him lying in bed, “muttering again and again: ‘Spare me! Please spare me!' ” The minister was flown off to a hospital in Canton. In the plane, he suddenly sank to his knees and banged his head on the floor, begging: “Please spare me …” He died in Canton within weeks, aged forty-six.*</p><p>毛也激烈指责周手下管经济的人，使这些人紧张得睡不着觉。南宁会议期间，第一机械工业部部长黄敬，彻夜不眠在房间里不停地来回走，受不了压力发了精神病。毛的大夫去看他，只见他“语无伦次，精神恍惚。不断地说：“饶命啊！饶命啊！”” 在送他去广州住院的飞机上，黄敬突然跪在同行者面前，磕头说：“饶了我吧。”不到三个星期，他就死在医院里，死时才四十六岁。*</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>* 黄敬是江青的第二任丈夫。一九三二年他们结婚时，他是个二十岁的激進学生，江是个十八岁的图书管理员。在黄的影响下，江青参加了中国共产党。同毛结婚后，江青曾数次约他“谈谈”，但都被黄敬断然回绝。这些私事同毛给黄敬施加的压力并无关系，毛似乎从来没有嫉妒的感情。一九四五年在重庆，毛还特地邀请江青的另一前夫唐纳出席招待会，会上介绍见面时，毛握着唐纳的手含笑说：“和为贵！” 唐纳为江青曾两度自杀，毛或许对他有些好奇心。毛掌权后，唐纳定居巴黎，在那里终老。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As the climax of this process of intimidation and abasement, Mao ordered Chou to make a self-criticism that would imply that he was a quasi-Rightist in front of the 1,360 delegates to a special Party Congress in May 1958. Chou apologized for his previous efforts to hamper Mao's desired rate of “industrialisation,” whose military nature was not revealed even to this high-level gathering, nor its catastrophic implications. This self-denunciation caused Chou a great deal of pain. It took him ten days to write his speech. The normally dapper premier spent days on end shut up in his room, unshaven and unkempt, not even getting dressed. The secretary taking his dictation recalled that Chou spoke extremely slowly, Chou then dictated, on the verge of tears. Chou had chosen his wife not out of love, but out of mutual devotion to the Communist cause, and she lived right up to that specification.</p><p>五月，毛令周在即将召开的加速军事工业化的“八大”二次会议上，面对一千三百六十名代表，当众作检讨，主要谈他如何犯了反冒進的错误，被右派分子利用来向党猖狂進攻，反右运动才使他“开始觉醒”。写这样一份检讨使周恩来痛苦万分，他整整花了十天时间，天天关在屋子里，胡子不刮，衣衫不整，往日的翩翩风度荡然无存。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>sometimes unable to say a word for five or six minutes … So I suggested I leave his office and let him compose quietly … It was midnight, and I returned to my room and lay in bed with my clothes on, waiting to be called.</p><p>写检讨的方式是周说一句，秘书记录一句，秘书看到他五六分钟说不出一句话来，建议自己走开，让他安静地构思。“周恩来同志同意了我的意见，当时已经深夜十二时了，我回到宿舍和衣躺在床上，等候随叫随去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At about 2 am [Mrs. Chou] summoned me. She said: “En-lai is sitting in the office staring blankly. How come you went to bed?…” So I followed [her] to [his] office, where she and comrade Chou En-lai argued for a long time …</p><p>……在第二天凌晨二时许，邓大姊把我叫去，她说：“恩来独坐在办公室发呆，怎么你却睡觉去了？””邓颖超同秘书到了周的办公室，和周争论了很久，要他写。周继续口授时，“几乎流出了眼泪”。周选择邓颖超做夫人，本来就不是出自爱情，而是“能一辈子从事革命”，邓正合周的要求。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Chou duly delivered his speech, to Mao's satisfaction. The atmosphere at the congress was more frightening than usual, as reflected in the language of the press announcement, which said the meeting had “denounced Rightists who have wormed their way into the Party”—in Communist jargon, barely one step away from damning such people as enemy agents. Orchestrated by Mao, a host of provinces announced how they had uncovered Rightists among their own provincial leaders. The provincial chief of Henan was condemned and dismissed for saying the peasants could not afford to hand over too much to the state as they were “starving.” Henan, he said, had endured “endless floods, droughts and other natural disasters,” and its inhabitants were “having to pull ploughs, since many draft animals have died because of the shortage of food.”</p><p>周的检讨终于叫毛满意了。这次大会气势汹汹，用《人民日报》的话说，是“反对混入党内的右派分子、地方主义分子、民族主义分子的会议”。后两项罪名针对的是各省领导中为本地老百姓说话的人。其中有河南省委第一书记潘复生。他说过这样一些话：河南地少人多，水旱灾害不断出现，但上缴的粮食太多，以至于“农民家无隔夜之粮”，“牲口死亡很多，人拉犁拉耙”。他希望少调些粮出省。会上他受到批判，取代他的是善于发表“谁说灾区人民苦得不得了”、“巧妇能为无米炊”等妙语的吴芝圃。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Liu Shao-chi also came under bitter attack from Mao's henchmen at the congress for his role in the 1956 cuts. Like Chou, he too capitulated fulsomely, as did everyone who had a managerial role in Mao's Superpower Program. Mao's notes show that he had been ready to charge anyone who refused to toe his line with what amounted to treason (“using illegal methods … to carry out opposition activities”). In the end he did not need to go this far, as all surrendered.</p><p>刘少奇在会上作的工作报告是自己打自己的耳光，不点名地批判他本人在一九五六年说的“宁可慢一点好”这一类话。小组会上，地方大员对刘進行围攻，说他批评得不够，语气太轻。像周恩来一样，刘选择了跟毛走。其他管经济的人也纷纷作检讨。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>毛事先已准备好，谁不听话，就打成搞阴谋的反党分子：“不经合法手续”，“進行反对活动”。但到闭幕会上讲话时，他提纲上写的这类话都没有讲。不必讲了，人人都已俯首听命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Liu stayed on as No. 2. Chou was so battered that he asked Mao “whether it is appropriate for me to go on being prime minister.” He was told to carry on, and he remained foreign affairs supremo, even though he was not reinstated as foreign minister. Mao was well aware that no one else could put so seductive a face on his regime. The man who took Chou's place as foreign minister, Chen Yi, remarked ruefully that he found himself being “no more than a glorified entertainer.”</p><p>刘仍然做毛的副手。周恩来感到威信扫地，他问毛“继续担任国务院总理是否适当”。毛叫他继续干，连外交也还让他管，尽管他已不再是外交部长。毛很清楚，论到在外国人面前给他的政权脸上贴金，没人赶得上周恩来。接替周当外交部长的陈毅后来不无自嘲地说，中国外交都是毛决策，周直接管，他这个外交部长无非是个“大招待员”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>MAO MADE ONE most important personnel shift at the congress. He promoted his old crony Lin Biao to be one of the Party's vice-chairmen (alongside Liu, Chou, Zhu De and Chen Yun). This gave Mao an ally-in-need in the core, one who also held a top army rank: a marshal. Formal military ranks had been introduced in 1955, when Lin and nine other generals were made marshals.</p><p>在“八大”二次会议上，毛作了一项十分重要的人事任命：把他的老搭档林彪提拔为党的副主席。这使得毛在核心领导中有了一个可靠的同盟。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Along with these steps, Mao intensified his personality cult, which he had started to promote from the time of the Yenan Terror in 1942–43. In March 1958 he told his top echelon (colleagues, provincial chiefs and ministers): “There has to be a personality cult … It is absolutely necessary.” His henchmen vied to declare their “blind faith” in Mao, with Shanghai boss Ke actually advocating the herd instinct: “We must follow the Chairman like a blind herd.”</p><p>毛开始强化对他本人的个人崇拜。毛的个人崇拜在赫鲁晓夫批判斯大林后稍有收敛，现在毛为它全面翻案。一九五八年三月，他在成都会议上说：“问题不在于个人崇拜，而在于是否是真理。是真理就要崇拜，”“必须崇拜，永远崇拜，不崇拜不得了”。他毫无逻辑地说不赞成个人崇拜的人“有个人目的，就是为了想让别人崇拜自己”。他手下的大员陶铸说：“对主席就是要迷信。”柯庆施说：“我们相信主席要相信到迷信的程度，服从主席要服从到盲目的程度。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To stoke his cult, Mao took the most unwonted step of visiting places like factories and agricultural cooperatives, and these visits were reported with huge fanfare. Mao was filmed for newsreels that were shown nationwide, and featured in a painting aptly titled Chairman Mao Walks All Over China, which became a household image. After Mao visited a village outside Chengdu in Sichuan, huge publicity was given to the story that the excited villagers changed its name to “Happiness Co-operative.” When Mao lifted a few bits of earth on a shovel at the Ming Tomb Reservoir on the outskirts of Peking, People's Daily wrote: “As soon as Chairman Mao put down the spade, a soldier named Yu Bing-sen wrapped the spade up in his clothes. He said with brimming emotions: ‘Whenever we see this spade we will think of Chairman Mao, and we will have greater energy.' An agricultural co-op member wept and told the reporter …”* These exaltations of Mao in the press were then force-fed to the entire population, the illiterate as well as the literate, at newspaper-study sessions that were a permanent fixture of life under Mao.</p><p>搞对毛的个人崇拜，主要靠报纸，不仅识字的人看得到，不识字的也知道，因为中国那时有集中起来听读报的规矩，不想听也得听。毛搞了一连串基层视察，使报纸有机会大登特登。毛在成都附近一个合作社聊了聊天，报上马上告诉全国人民：“社员们都说：能够看到毛主席，是一辈子最大的幸福；毛主席看了自己社里的庄稼，是全社最大的幸福。”毛在十三陵水库铲了几铲土，这几铲土大概是毛执政以来的唯一一次劳动，《人民日报》头版跟着就是一篇妙文：“当毛主库铲土的时候，在周围聚集上万的人以幸福的眼光仔细看着毛主席怎样把一锨一锨的土送進柳条筐里。毛主席刚一放下铁锨，一个叫余秉森的解放军战士，马上用自己的衣服把这张铁锨包起来。他激动地说：“看到这张锨，我们就想起了毛主席，这样，我们的干劲就会更大。””所有这一切都在报上详细报导，使全国人民明白这是他们对毛应有的态度。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On 13 August, for the only time throughout his 27-year reign, Mao ate in a restaurant, in Tianjin. There he was sighted, undoubtedly as intended, as he not only got out of the car in front of the restaurant, but appeared at the window upstairs. “Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!” people began to chant. Word spread fast, and soon a hysterical crowd of tens of thousands surrounded the restaurant for several blocks, jumping up and down and screaming “Long Live Chairman Mao!” One of Mao's secretaries got worried about security, and suggested that Mao should leave while a bodyguard with a build similar to Mao's drew the crowd off. But Mao vetoed it. He had come to the place to be seen, and he was not in any danger, as this was a surprise visit, and he was distant enough from the crowd, none of whom could possibly have a gun anyway. (One of his regime's first acts had been to confiscate weapons.) And the people around the restaurant had almost certainly been preselected, as happened in other places where Mao appeared. Mao waved at the crowd, who replied with more frenzy and weeping. All of which was reported in great detail in the papers.</p><p>八月十三日，毛破天荒進了家餐馆：天津“正阳春”。他理所当然地被认出来了--怎么可能认不出来呢？他不仅在餐馆门口下车，还在楼上餐厅里打开纱窗，探出头去。“毛主席！毛主席！”人们开始惊呼，很快数万人挤在楼前街上欢呼跳跃，喊着“毛主席万岁”。秘书担心他的安全，建议毛离开，用身材相仿的警卫战士把人群吸引走。毛拒绝了。他来餐馆就是被看的。他知道他不会有任何危险：来前没人知道，餐楼离人群很远。环绕餐馆的人也肯定是事先安排的，就像毛参观的别处一样。毛几次在楼上窗前亮相挥手，人群更是不可遏止地激狂。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Mao eventually left, after several hours, he described his departure to his inner circle in almost godlike language: “I gave one wave, and the crowd receded.” He reveled in the way his cult was thriving and told his coterie that he “was deeply impressed.” Years of force-feeding his personality cult had endowed him with awesome power.</p><p>毛事后对中共高层不无得意地说：“我在天津参观时，几万人围着我，我把手一摆，人们都散开了。”毛俨然已是上帝。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>*This minister, Huang Jing, had been the second husband of Mme Mao. They married when he was a handsome twenty-year-old radical student and she an eighteen-year-old librarian in 1932, and she joined the Party under his influence. After she married Mao, she occasionally invited her ex-husband over “for a chat,” but he declined every time. The pressure on him now was nothing personal on Mao's part, as Mao was never jealous. In fact, in Chongqing in 1945 Mao had made a point of inviting another of his wife's former husbands, Tang Na, to a reception, and greeted him with a twinkle in his eye and a crack, as Tang Na had once attempted suicide over the future Mme Mao. Tang Na settled in Paris after Mao took power, and subsequently died there.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>*Shoveling earth at the Ming Tomb Reservoir for those few minutes was the only physical labor Mao put in during his entire rule, although he made heavy labor compulsory and routine for nearly everyone in China, children included, on the grounds that it helped maintain their ideological purity.</p><p></p></div>
