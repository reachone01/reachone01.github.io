<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s 1905 burst of creativity was astonishing. He had devised a revolutionary quantum theory of light, helped prove the existence of atoms, explained Brownian motion, upended the concept of space and time, and produced what would become science’s best known equation. But not many people seemed to notice at first. According to his sister, Einstein had hoped that his flurry of essays in a preeminent journal would lift him from the obscurity of a third-class patent examiner and provide some academic recognition, perhaps even an academic job. “But he was bitterly disappointed,” she noted. “Icy silence followed the publication.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos418418" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1685862" class="calibre22">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">That was not exactly true. A small but respectable handful of physicists soon took note of Einstein’s papers, and one of these turned out to be, as good fortune would have it, the most important possible admirer he could attract: Max Planck, Europe’s revered monarch of theoretical physics, whose mysterious mathematical constant explaining black-body radiation Einstein had transformed into a radical new reality of nature. As the editorial board member of <em class="calibre6">Annalen der Physik</em> responsible for theoretical submissions, Planck had vetted Einstein’s papers, and the one on relativity had “immediately aroused my lively attention,” he later recalled. As soon as it was published, Planck gave a lecture on relativity at the University of Berlin.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos419300" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1686001" class="calibre22">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos419398" class="calibre3"></a>Planck became the first physicist to build on Einstein’s theory. In an article published in the spring of 1906, he argued that relativity conformed to the principle of least action, a foundation of physics that holds that light or any object moving between two points should follow the easiest path.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos419715" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1686247" class="calibre22">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Planck’s paper not only contributed to the development of relativity theory; it also helped to legitimize it among other physicists. Whatever disappointment Maja Einstein had detected in her brother dissipated. “My papers are much appreciated and are giving rise to further investigations,” he exulted to Solovine. “Professor Planck has recently written to me about that.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos420220" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1686801" class="calibre22">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The proud patent examiner was soon exchanging letters with the eminent professor. When another theorist challenged Planck’s contention that relativity theory conformed to the principle of least action, Einstein took Planck’s side and sent him a card saying so. Planck was pleased. “As long as the proponents of the principle of relativity constitute such a modest little band as is now the case,” he replied to Einstein, “it is doubly important that they agree among themselves.” He added that he hoped to visit Bern the following year and meet Einstein personally.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos420924" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687031" class="calibre22">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Planck did not end up coming to Bern, but he did send his earnest assistant, Max Laue.<a id="filepos421108" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_050.html#filepos2410587" class="calibre22">*</a> He and Einstein had already been corresponding about Einstein’s light quanta paper, with Laue saying that he agreed with “your heuristic view that radiation can be absorbed and emitted only in specific finite quanta.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">However, Laue insisted, just as Planck had, that Einstein was wrong to assume that these quanta were a characteristic of the radiation itself. Instead, Laue contended that the quanta were merely a description of the way that radiation was emitted or absorbed by a piece of matter. “This is not a characteristic of electromagnetic processes in a vacuum but rather of the emitting or absorbing matter,” Laue wrote, “and hence radiation does not consist of light quanta as it says in section six of your first paper.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos421979" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687207" class="calibre22">6</a></sup> (In that section, Einstein had said that the radiation “behaves thermodynamically as if it consisted of mutually independent energy quanta.”)</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos422231" class="calibre3"></a>When Laue was preparing to visit in the summer of 1907, he was surprised to discover that Einstein was not at the University of Bern but was working at the patent office on the third floor of the Post and Telegraph Building. Meeting Einstein there did not lessen his wonder. “The young man who came to meet me made so unexpected an impression on me that I did not believe he could possibly be the father of the relativity theory,” Laue said, “so I let him pass.” After a while, Einstein came wandering through the reception area again, and Laue finally realized who he was.</p>
<p class="calibre29">They walked and talked for hours, with Einstein at one point offering a cigar that, Laue recalled, “was so unpleasant that I ‘accidentally’ dropped it into the river.” Einstein’s theories, on the other hand, made a pleasing impression. “During the first two hours of our conversation he overthrew the entire mechanics and electrodynamics,” Laue noted. Indeed, he was so enthralled that over the next four years he would publish eight papers on Einstein’s relativity theory and become a close friend.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos423444" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687362" class="calibre22">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Some theorists found the amazing flurry of papers from the patent office to be uncomfortably abstract. Arnold Sommerfeld, later a friend, was among the first to suggest there was something Jewish about Einstein’s theoretical approach, a theme later picked up by anti-Semites. It lacked due respect for the notion of order and absolutes, and it did not seem solidly grounded. “As remarkable as Einstein’s papers are,” he wrote Lorentz in 1907, “it still seems to me that something almost unhealthy lies in this unconstruable and impossible to visualize dogma. An Englishman would hardly have given us this theory. It might be here too, as in the case of Cohn, the abstract conceptual character of the Semite expresses itself.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos424308" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687537" class="calibre22">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">None of this interest made Einstein famous, nor did it get him any job offers. “I was surprised to read that you must sit in an office for eight hours a day,” wrote yet another young physicist who was planning to visit. “History is full of bad jokes.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos424686" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687959" class="calibre22">9</a></sup> But because he had finally earned his doctorate, he had at least gotten promoted from a third-class <a id="filepos424828" class="calibre3"></a>to a second-class technical expert at the patent office, which came with a hefty 1,000-franc raise to an annual salary of 4,500 francs.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos424975" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688116" class="calibre22">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">His productivity was startling. In addition to working six days a week at the patent office, he continued his torrent of papers and reviews: six in 1906 and ten more in 1907. At least once a week he played in a string quartet. And he was a good father to the 3-year-old son he proudly labeled “impertinent.” As Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> wrote to her friend Helene Savi<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>, “My husband often spends his free time at home just playing with the boy.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos425606" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688284" class="calibre22">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Beginning in the summer of 1907, Einstein also found time to dabble in what might have become, if the fates had been more impish, a new career path: as an inventor and salesman of electrical devices like his uncle and father. Working with Olympia Academy member Conrad Habicht and his brother Paul, Einstein developed a machine to amplify tiny electrical charges so they could be measured and studied. It had more academic than practical purpose; the idea was to create a lab device that would permit the study of small electrical fluctuations.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The concept was simple. When two strips of metal move close to each other, an electric charge on one will induce an opposite charge on the other. Einstein’s idea was to use a series of strips that would induce the charge ten times and then transfer that to another disc. The process would be repeated until the original minuscule charge would be multiplied by a large number and thus be easily measurable. The trick was making the contraption actually work.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos426774" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688530" class="calibre22">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Given his heritage, breeding, and years in the patent office, Einstein had the background to be an engineering genius. But as it turned out, he was better suited to theorizing. Fortunately, Paul Habicht was a good machinist, and by August 1907 he had a prototype of the <em class="calibre6">Maschinchen,</em> or little machine, ready to be unveiled. “I am astounded at the lightning speed with which you built the <em class="calibre6">Maschinchen,</em>” Einstein wrote. “I’ll show up on Sunday.” Unfortunately, it didn’t work. “I am driven by <em class="calibre6">murderous</em> curiosity as to what you’re up to,” Einstein wrote a month later as they tried to fix things.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Throughout 1908, letters flew back and forth between Einstein and the Habichts, filled with complex diagrams and a torrent of ideas for <a id="filepos427741" class="calibre3"></a>how to make the device work. Einstein published a description in a journal, which produced, for a while, a potential sponsor. Paul Habicht was able to build a better version by October, but it had trouble keeping a charge. He brought the machine to Bern, where Einstein commandeered a lab in one of the schools and dragooned a local mechanic. By November the machine seemed to be working. It took another year or so to get a patent and begin to make some versions for sale. But even then, it never truly caught hold or found a market, and Einstein eventually lost interest.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos428326" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688798" class="calibre22">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">These practical exploits may have been fun, but Einstein’s glorious isolation from the priesthood of academic physicists was starting to have more drawbacks than advantages. In a paper he wrote in the spring of 1907, he began by exuding a joyful self-assurance about having neither the library nor the inclination to know what other theorists had written on the topic. “Other authors might have already clarified part of what I am going to say,” he wrote. “I felt I could dispense with doing a literature search (which would have been very troublesome for me), especially since there is good reason to hope that others will fill this gap.” However, when he was commissioned to write a major year-book piece on relativity later that year, there was slightly less cockiness in his warning to the editor that he might not be aware of all the literature. “Unfortunately I am not in a position to acquaint myself about everything that has been published on this subject,” he wrote, “because the library is closed in my free time.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos429509" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1689112" class="calibre22">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">That year he applied for a position at the University of Bern as a <em class="calibre6">privatdozent,</em> a starter rung on the academic ladder, which involved giving lectures and collecting a small fee from anyone who felt like showing up. To become a professor at most European universities, it helped to serve such an apprenticeship. With his application Einstein enclosed seventeen papers he had published, including the ones on relativity and light quanta. He was also expected to include an unpublished paper known as a <em class="calibre6">habilitation</em> thesis, but he decided not to bother writing one, as this requirement was sometimes waived for those who had “other outstanding achievements.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Only one professor on the faculty committee supported hiring him without requiring him to write a new thesis, “in view of the important <a id="filepos430493" class="calibre3"></a>scientific achievements of Herr Einstein.” The others disagreed, and the requirement was not waived. Not surprisingly, Einstein considered the matter “amusing.” He did not write the special <em class="calibre6">habilitation</em> or get the post.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos430751" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1689389" class="calibre22">15</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">The Equivalence of Gravity and Acceleration</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s road to the general theory of relativity began in November 1907, when he was struggling against a deadline to finish an article for a science yearbook explaining his special theory of relativity. Two limitations of that theory still bothered him: it applied only to uniform constant-velocity motion (things felt and behaved differently if your speed or direction was changing), and it did not incorporate Newton’s theory of gravity.</p>
<p class="calibre29">“I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a sudden a thought occurred to me,” he recalled. “If a person falls freely, he will not feel his own weight.”That realization, which “startled” him, launched him on an arduous eight-year effort to generalize his special theory of relativity and “impelled me toward a theory of gravitation.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos431922" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1689601" class="calibre22">16</a></sup> Later, he would grandly call it “the happiest<a id="filepos432016" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_051.html#filepos2410784" class="calibre22">*</a> thought in my life.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos432083" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1689737" class="calibre22">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The tale of the falling man has become an iconic one, and in some accounts it actually involves a painter who fell from the roof of an apartment building near the patent office.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos432364" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1690088" class="calibre22">18</a></sup> In fact, probably like other great tales of gravitational discovery—Galileo dropping objects from the Tower of Pisa and the apple falling on Newton’s head<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos432578" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1690295" class="calibre22">19</a></sup>—it was embellished in popular lore and was more of a thought experiment than a real occurrence. Despite Einstein’s propensity to focus on science rather than the merely personal, even he was not likely to watch a real human plunging off a roof and think of gravitational theory, much less call it the happiest thought in his life.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein refined his thought experiment so that the falling man was in an enclosed chamber, such as an elevator in free fall above the earth. In this falling chamber (at least until it crashed), the man would feel weightless. Any objects he emptied from his pocket and let loose would float alongside him.</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos433382" class="calibre3"></a>Looking at it another way, Einstein imagined a man in an enclosed chamber floating in deep space “far removed from stars and other appreciable masses.” He would experience the same perceptions of weightlessness. “Gravitation naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Then Einstein imagined that a rope was hooked onto the roof of the chamber and pulled up with a constant force. “The chamber together with the observer then begin to move ‘upwards’ with a uniformly accelerated motion.”The man inside will feel himself pressed to the floor. “He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of a house on our earth.” If he pulls something from his pocket and lets go, it will fall to the floor “with an accelerated relative motion” that is the same no matter the weight of the object—just as Galileo discovered to be the case for gravity. “The man in the chamber will thus come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational field. Of course he will be puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this gravitational field. Just then, however, he discovers the hook in the middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it, and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chamber is suspended at rest in the gravitational field.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">“Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion?” Einstein asked. Just as with special relativity, there was no right or wrong perception. “We must rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos435362" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1690660" class="calibre22">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">A related way that Einstein addressed this same issue was typical of his ingenuity: he examined a phenomenon that was so very well-known that scientists rarely puzzled about it. Every object has a “gravitational mass,” which determines its weight on the earth’s surface or, more generally, the tug between it and any other object. It also has an “inertial mass,” which determines how much force must be applied to it in order to make it accelerate. As Newton noted, the inertial mass of <a id="filepos435978" class="calibre3"></a>an object is always the same as its gravitational mass, even though they are defined differently. This was obviously more than a mere coincidence, but no one had fully explained why.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Uncomfortable with two explanations for what seemed to be one phenomenon, Einstein probed the equivalence of inertial mass and gravitational mass using his thought experiment. If we imagine that the enclosed elevator is being accelerated upward in a region of outer space where there is no gravity, then the downward force felt by the man inside (or the force that tugs downward on an object hanging from the ceiling by a string) is due to <em class="calibre6">inertial</em> mass. If we imagine that the enclosed elevator is at rest in a gravitational field, then the downward force felt by the man inside (or the force that tugs downward on an object hanging from the ceiling by a string) is due to <em class="calibre6">gravitational</em> mass. But inertial mass always equals gravitational mass. “From this correspondence,” said Einstein, “it follows that it is impossible to discover by experiment whether a given system of coordinates is accelerated, or whether . . . the observed effects are due to a gravitational field.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos437246" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1690807" class="calibre22">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein called this “the equivalence principle.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos437411" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1691068" class="calibre22">22</a></sup> The local effects of gravity and of acceleration are equivalent. This became a foundation for his attempt to generalize his theory of relativity so that it was not restricted just to systems that moved with a uniform velocity. The basic insight that he would develop over the next eight years was that “the effects we ascribe to gravity and the effects we ascribe to acceleration are both produced by one and the same structure.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos437900" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1691377" class="calibre22">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s approach to general relativity again showed how his mind tended to work:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre43">• He was disquieted when there were two seemingly unrelated theories for the same observable phenomenon. That had been the case with the moving coil or moving magnet producing the same observable electric current, which he resolved with the special theory of relativity. Now it was the case with the differing definitions of inertial mass and gravitational mass, which he began to resolve by building on the equivalence principle.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre43">• He was likewise uncomfortable when a theory made distinctions <a id="filepos438747" class="calibre3"></a>that could not be observed in nature. That had been the case with observers in uniform motion: there was no way of determining who was at rest and who was in motion. Now it was also, apparently, the case for observers in accelerated motion: there was no way of telling who was accelerating and who was in a gravitational field.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre43">• He was eager to generalize theories rather than settling for having them restricted to a special case. There should not, he felt, be one set of principles for the special case of constant-velocity motion and a different set for all other types of motion. His life was a constant quest for unifying theories.</p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre45">In November 1907, working against the deadline imposed by the <em class="calibre6">Yearbook of Radioactivity and Electronics,</em> Einstein tacked on a fifth section to his article on relativity that sketched out his new ideas. “So far we have applied the principle of relativity ...only to nonaccelerated reference systems,” he began. “Is it conceivable that the principle of relativity applies to systems that are accelerated relative to each other?”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Imagine two environments, he said, one being accelerated and the other resting in a gravitational field.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos440174" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1691511" class="calibre22">24</a></sup> There is no physical experiment you can do that would tell these situations apart. “In the discussion that follows, we shall therefore assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding acceleration of the reference system.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Using various mathematical calculations that can be made about an accelerated system, Einstein proceeded to show that, if his notions were correct, clocks would run more slowly in a more intense gravitational field. He also came up with many predictions that could be tested, including that light should be bent by gravity and that the wavelength of light emitted from a source with a large mass, such as the sun, should increase slightly in what has become known as the gravitational redshift. “On the basis of some ruminating, which, though daring, does have something going for it, I have arrived at the view that the gravitational difference might be the cause of the shift to the red end of the spectrum,” he explained to a colleague. “A bending of light rays by gravity also follows from these arguments.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos441385" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1691758" class="calibre22">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos441484" class="calibre3"></a>It would take Einstein another eight years, until November 1915, to work out the fundamentals of this theory and find the math to express it. Then it would take another four years before the most vivid of his predictions, the extent to which gravity would bend light, was verified by dramatic observations. But at least Einstein now had a vision, one that started him on the road toward one of the most elegant and impressive achievements in the history of physics: the general theory of relativity.</p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">Winning a Professorship</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">By the beginning of 1908, even as such academic stars as Max Planck and Wilhelm Wien were writing to ask for his insights, Einstein had tempered his aspirations to be a university professor. Instead, he had begun, believe it or not, to seek work as a high school teacher. “This craving,” he told Marcel Grossmann, who had helped him get the patent-office job, “comes only from my ardent wish to be able to continue my private scientific work under easier conditions.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">He was even eager to go back to the Technical School in Winter-hur, where he had briefly been a substitute teacher. “How does one go about this?” he asked Grossmann. “Could I possibly call on somebody and talk him into the great worth of my admirable person as a teacher and a citizen? Wouldn’t I make a bad impression on him (no Swiss-German dialect, my Semitic appearance, etc.)?” He had written papers that were transforming physics, but he did not know if that would help. “Would there be any point in my stressing my scientific papers on that occasion?”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos443330" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692091" class="calibre22">26</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">He also responded to an advertisement for a “teacher of mathematics and descriptive geometry” at a high school in Zurich, noting in his application “that I would be ready to teach physics as well.” He ended up deciding to enclose all of the papers he had written thus far, including the special theory of relativity. There were twenty-one applicants. Einstein did not even make the list of three finalists.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos443864" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692255" class="calibre22">27</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">So Einstein finally overcame his pride and decided to write a thesis in order to become a <em class="calibre6">privatdozent</em> at Bern. As he explained to the patron there who had supported him, “The conversation I had with you in the city library, as well as the advice of several friends, has induced <a id="filepos444257" class="calibre3"></a>me to change my decision for the second time and to try my luck with a <em class="calibre6">habilitation</em> at the University of Bern after all.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos444405" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692454" class="calibre22">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The paper he submitted, an extension of his revolutionary work on light quanta, was promptly accepted, and at the end of February 1908, he was made a <em class="calibre6">privatdozent.</em> He had finally scaled the walls, or at least the outer wall, of academe. But his post neither paid enough nor was important enough for him to give up his job at the patent office. His lectures at the University of Bern thus became simply one more thing for him to do.</p>
<p class="calibre29">His topic for the summer of 1908 was the theory of heat, held on Tuesday and Saturday at 7 a.m., and he initially attracted only three attendees: Michele Besso and two other colleagues who worked at the postal building. In the winter session he switched to the theory of radiation, and his three coworkers were joined by an actual student named Max Stern. By the summer of 1909, Stern was the only attendee, and Einstein canceled his lecturing. He had, in the meantime, begun to adopt his professorial look: both his hair and clothing became a victim of nature’s tendency toward randomness.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos445602" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692656" class="calibre22">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Alfred Kleiner, the University of Zurich physics professor who helped Einstein get his doctorate, had encouraged him to pursue the <em class="calibre6">privatdozent</em> position.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos445868" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692846" class="calibre22">30</a></sup> He also had waged a long effort, which succeeded in 1908, to convince the Zurich authorities to increase the university’s stature by creating a new position in theoretical physics. It was not a full professorship; instead, it was an associate professorship under Kleiner.</p>
<p class="calibre29">It was the obvious post for Einstein, but there was one obstacle. Kleiner had another candidate in mind: his assistant Friedrich Adler, a pale and passionate political activist who had become friends with Einstein when they were both at the Polytechnic. Adler, whose father was the leader of the Social Democratic Party in Austria, was more disposed to political philosophy than theoretical physics. So he went to see Kleiner one morning in June 1908, and the two of them concluded that Adler was not right for the job and Einstein was.</p>
<p class="calibre29">In a letter to his father, Adler recounted the conversation and said that Einstein “had no understanding how to relate to people” and had been “treated by the professors at the Polytechnic with outright contempt.” <a id="filepos447076" class="calibre3"></a>But Adler said he deserved the job because of his genius and was likely to get it. “They have a bad conscience over how they treated him earlier. The scandal is being felt not only here but in Germany that such a man would have to sit in the patent office.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos447357" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693008" class="calibre22">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Adler made sure that the Zurich authorities, and for that matter everyone else, knew that he was officially stepping aside for his friend. “If it is possible to get a man like Einstein for our university, it would be absurd to appoint me,” he wrote. That resolved the political issue for the councilor in charge of education, who was a partisan Social Democrat. “Ernst would have liked Adler, since he was a fellow party member,” Einstein explained to Michele Besso. “But Adler’s statements about himself and me made it impossible.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos448035" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693335" class="calibre22">32</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">So, at the end of June 1908, Kleiner traveled from Zurich to Bern to audit one of Einstein’s <em class="calibre6">privatdozent</em> lectures and, as Einstein put it, “size up the beast.” Alas, it was not a great show. “I really did not lecture divinely,” Einstein lamented to a friend, “partly because I was not well prepared, partly because being investigated got on my nerves a bit.” Kleiner sat listening with a wrinkled brow, and after the lecture he informed Einstein that his teaching style was not good enough to qualify him for the professorship. Einstein calmly claimed that he considered the job “quite unnecessary.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos448802" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693513" class="calibre22">33</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Kleiner went back to Zurich and reported that Einstein “holds monologues” and was “a long way from being a teacher.” That seemed to end his chances. As Adler informed his powerful father, “The situation has therefore changed, and the Einstein business is closed.” Einstein pretended to be sanguine. “The business with the professorship fell through, but that’s all right with me,” he wrote a friend. “There are enough teachers even without me.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos449416" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693683" class="calibre22">34</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">In fact Einstein was upset, and he became even more so when he heard that Kleiner’s criticism of his teaching skills was being widely circulated, even in Germany. So he wrote to Kleiner, angrily reproaching him “for spreading unfavorable rumors about me.” He was already finding it difficult to get a proper academic job, and Kleiner’s assessment would make it impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre29">There was some validity to Kleiner’s criticism. Einstein was never an inspired teacher, and his lectures tended to be regarded as disorganized <a id="filepos450117" class="calibre3"></a>until his celebrity ensured that every stumble he made was transformed into a charming anecdote. Nevertheless, Kleiner relented. He said that he would be pleased to help him get the Zurich job if he could only show “some teaching ability.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein replied by suggesting that he come to Zurich to give a full-fledged (and presumably well-prepared) lecture to the physics society there, which he did in February 1909. “I was lucky,” Einstein reported soon after. “Contrary to my habit, I lectured well on that occasion.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos450740" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693889" class="calibre22">35</a></sup> When he went to call on Kleiner afterward, the professor intimated that a job offer would soon follow.</p>
<p class="calibre29">A few days after Einstein returned to Bern, Kleiner provided his official recommendation to the University of Zurich faculty. “Einstein ranks among the most important theoretical physicists and has been recognized as such since his work on the relativity principle,” he wrote. As for Einstein’s teaching skills, he said as politely as possible that they were ripe for improvement: “Dr. Einstein will prove his worth also as a teacher, because he is too intelligent and too conscientious not to be open to advice when necessary.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos451505" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694047" class="calibre22">36</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">One issue was Einstein’s Jewishness. Some faculty members considered this a potential problem, but they were assured by Kleiner that Einstein did not exhibit the “unpleasant peculiarities” supposedly associated with Jews. Their conclusion is a revealing look at both the anti-Semitism of the time and the attempts to rise above it:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre38"><p class="calibre21">The expressions of our colleague Kleiner, based on several years of personal contact, were all the more valuable for the committee as well as for the faculty as a whole since Herr Dr. Einstein is an Israelite and since precisely to the Israelites among scholars are inscribed (in numerous cases not entirely without cause) all kinds of unpleasant peculiarities of character, such as intrusiveness, impudence, and a shopkeeper’s mentality in the perception of their academic position. It should be said, however, that also among the Israelites there exist men who do not exhibit a trace of these disagreeable qualities and that it is not proper, therefore, to disqualify a man only because he happens to be a Jew. Indeed, one occasionally finds people also among non-Jewish scholars who in regard to a commercial perception and utilization of their academic profession develop qualities that are usually considered as specifically Jewish. Therefore, neither the committee nor the faculty as a whole considered it compatible with its dignity to adopt anti-Semitism as a matter of policy.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos453130" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694281" class="calibre22">37</a></sup></p></blockquote><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos453242" class="calibre3"></a>The secret faculty vote in late March 1909 was ten in favor and one abstention. Einstein was offered his first professorship, four years after he had revolutionized physics. Unfortunately, his proposed salary was less than what he was making at the patent office, so he declined. Finally, the Zurich authorities raised their offer, and Einstein accepted. “So, now I too am an official member of the guild of whores,” he exulted to a colleague.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos453709" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694450" class="calibre22">38</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">One person who saw a newspaper notice about Einstein’s appointment was a Basel housewife named Anna Meyer-Schmid. Ten years earlier, when she was an unmarried girl of 17, they had met during one of Einstein’s vacations with his mother at the Hotel Paradies. Most of the guests had seemed to him “philistines,” but he took a liking to Anna and even wrote a poem in her album: “What should I inscribe for you here? / I could think of many things / Including a kiss / On your tiny little mouth / If you’re angry about it / Do not start to cry / The best punishment / Is to give me one too.” He signed it, “Your rascally friend.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos454492" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694608" class="calibre22">39</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">In response to a congratulatory postcard from her, Einstein replied with a polite and mildly suggestive letter. “I probably cherish the memory of the lovely weeks that I was allowed to spend near you in the Paradies more than you do,” he wrote. “So now I’ve become such a big schoolmaster that my name is even mentioned in the newspapers. But I have remained a simple fellow.” He noted that he had married his college friend Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>, but he gave her his office address. “If you ever happen to be in Zurich and have time, look me up there; it would give me great pleasure.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos455247" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694796" class="calibre22">40</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Whether or not Einstein intended his response to hover uncertainly between innocence and suggestiveness, Anna’s eyes apparently snapped it into the latter position. She wrote a letter back, which Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> intercepted. Her jealousy aroused, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> then wrote a letter to Anna’s husband claiming (wishfully more than truthfully) that Einstein was outraged by Anna’s “inappropriate letter” and brazen attempt to rekindle a relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein ended up having to calm matters with an apology to the husband. “I am very sorry if I have caused you distress by my careless behavior,” he wrote. “I answered the congratulatory card your wife sent <a id="filepos456165" class="calibre3"></a>me on the occasion of my appointment too heartily and thereby re-awakened the old affection we had for each other. But this was not done with impure intentions. The behavior of your wife, for whom I have the greatest respect, was totally honorable. It was wrong of my wife—and excusable only on account of extreme jealousy—to behave—without my knowledge—the way she did.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Although the incident itself was of no consequence, it marked a turn in Einstein’s relationship with Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>. In his eyes, her brooding jealousy was making her darker. Decades later, still rankling at Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>’s behavior, he wrote to Anna’s daughter asserting, with a brutal bluntness, that his wife’s jealousy had been a pathological flaw typical of a woman of such “uncommon ugliness.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos457131" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694961" class="calibre22">41</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> indeed had a jealous streak. She resented not only her husband’s flirtations with other women but also the time he spent with male colleagues. Now that he had become a professor, she succumbed to a professional envy that was understandable given her own curtailed scientific career. “With that kind of fame, he does not have much time left for his wife,” she told her friend Helene Savi<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>. “You wrote that I must be jealous of science. But what can you do? One gets the pearl, the other the box.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">In particular, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> worried that her husband’s fame would make him colder and more self-centered. “I am very happy for his success, because he really does deserve it,” she wrote in another letter. “I only hope that fame does not exert a detrimental influence on his human side.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos458249" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1695292" class="calibre22">42</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">In one sense, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>’s worries proved unwarranted. Even as his fame increased exponentially, Einstein would retain a personal simplicity, an unaffected style, and at least a veneer of genial humility. But viewed from a different reference frame, there were transformations to his human side. Sometime around 1909, he began drifting apart from his wife. His resistance to chains and bonds increasingly led him to escape into his work while taking a detached approach to the realm he dismissed as “the merely personal.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">On one of his last days working at the patent office, he received a large envelope with an elegant sheet covered in what seemed to be Latin calligraphy. Because it seemed odd and impersonal, he threw it <a id="filepos459181" class="calibre3"></a>in the wastebasket. It was, in fact, an invitation to be one of those receiving an honorary doctorate at the July 1909 commemoration of the founding of Geneva’s university, and authorities there finally got a friend of Einstein to persuade him to attend. Einstein brought only a straw hat and an informal suit, so he stood out rather strangely, both in the parade and at the opulent formal dinner that night. Amused by the whole situation, he turned to the patrician seated next to him and speculated about the austere Protestant Reformation leader who had founded the university: “Do you know what Calvin would have done had he been here?” The gentleman, befuddled, said no. Einstein replied, “He would have erected an enormous stake and had us all burnt for our sinful extravagance.” As Einstein later recalled,“The man never addressed another word to me.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos460093" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1695610" class="calibre22">43</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">Light Can Be Wave and Particle</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">Also at the end of the summer of 1909, Einstein was invited to address the annual <em class="calibre6">Naturforscher</em> conference, the preeminent meeting of German-speaking scientists, which was held that year in Salzburg. Organizers had put both relativity and the quantum nature of light on the agenda, and they expected him to speak on the former. Instead, Einstein decided that he preferred to emphasize what he considered the more pressing issue: how to interpret quantum theory and reconcile it with the wave theory of light that Maxwell had so elegantly formulated.</p>
<p class="calibre29">After his “happiest thought” at the end of 1907 about how the equivalence of gravity and acceleration might lead to a generalization of relativity theory, Einstein had put that subject aside to focus instead on what he called “the radiation problem” (i.e., quantum theory). The more he thought about his “heuristic” notion that light was made up of quanta, or indivisible packets, the more he worried that he and Planck had wrought a revolution that would destroy the classical foundations of physics, especially Maxwell’s equations. “I have come to this pessimistic view mainly as a result of endless, vain efforts to interpret . . . Planck’s constant in an intuitive way,” he wrote a fellow physicist early in 1908. “I even seriously doubt that it will be possible to maintain the <a id="filepos461793" class="calibre3"></a>general validity of Maxwell’s equations.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos461858" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1695779" class="calibre22">44</a></sup> (As it turned out, his love of Maxwell’s equations was well placed. They are among the few elements of theoretical physics to remain unchanged by both the relativity and quantum revolutions that Einstein helped launch.)</p>
<p class="calibre29">When Einstein, still not officially a professor, arrived at the Salzburg conference in September 1909, he finally met Max Planck and other giants that he had known only through letters. On the afternoon of the third day, he stepped in front of more than a hundred famed scientists and delivered a speech that Wolfgang Pauli, who was to become a pioneer of quantum mechanics, later pronounced “one of the landmarks in the development of theoretical physics.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein began by explaining how the wave theory of light was no longer complete. Light (or any radiation) could also be regarded, he said, as a beam of particles or packets of energy, which he said was akin to what Newton had posited. “Light has certain basic properties that can be understood more readily from the standpoint of the Newtonian emission theory than from the standpoint of the wave theory,” he declared. “I thus believe that the next phase of theoretical physics will bring us a theory of light that can be interpreted as a kind of fusion of the wave and of the emission theories of light.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Combining particle theory with wave theory, he warned, would bring “a profound change.” This was not a good thing, he feared. It could undermine the certainties and determinism inherent in classical physics.</p>
<p class="calibre29">For a moment, Einstein mused that perhaps such a fate could be avoided by accepting Planck’s more limited interpretation of quanta: that they were features only of how radiation was emitted and absorbed by a surface rather than a feature of the actual light wave as it propagated through space. “Would it not be possible,” he asked, “to retain at least the equations for the propagation of radiation and conceive only the processes of emission and absorption differently?” But after comparing the behavior of light to the behavior of gas molecules, as he had done in his 1905 light quanta paper, Einstein concluded that, alas, this was not possible.</p>
<p class="calibre29">As a result, Einstein said, light must be regarded as behaving like both an undulating wave and a stream of particles. “These two <a id="filepos464544" class="calibre3"></a>structural properties simultaneously displayed by radiation,” he declared at the end of his talk, “should not be considered as mutually incompatible.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos464724" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1696047" class="calibre22">45</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">It was the first well-conceived promulgation of the wave-particle duality of light, and it had implications as profound as Einstein’s earlier theoretical breakthroughs. “Is it possible to combine energy quanta and the wave principles of radiation?” he merrily wrote to a physicist friend. “Appearances are against it, but the Almighty—it seems—managed the trick.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos465233" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1696447" class="calibre22">46</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">A vibrant discussion followed Einstein’s speech, led by Planck himself. Still unwilling to embrace the physical reality underlying the mathematical constant that he had devised nine years earlier, or to accept the revolutionary ramifications envisioned by Einstein, Planck now played protector of the old order. He admitted that radiation involved discrete “quanta, which are to be conceived as atoms of action.” But he insisted that these quanta existed <em class="calibre6">only</em> as part of the process of radiation being emitted or absorbed. “The question is where to look for these quanta,” he said. “According to Mr. Einstein, it would be necessary to conceive that free radiation in a vacuum, and thus the light waves themselves consist of atomistic quanta, and hence force us to give up Maxwell’s equations. This seems to me a step that is not yet necessary.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos466238" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1696997" class="calibre22">47</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Within two decades, Einstein would assume a similar role as protector of the old order. Indeed, he was already looking for ways out of the eerie dilemmas raised by quantum theory. “I am very hopeful that I will solve the radiation problem, and that I will do so without light quanta,” he wrote a young physicist he was working with.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos466686" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697187" class="calibre22">48</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">It was all too mystifying, at least for the time being. So as he moved up the professorial ranks in the German-speaking universities of Europe, he turned his attention back to the topic that was uniquely his own, relativity, and for a while became a refugee from the wonderland of the quanta. As he lamented to a friend, “The more successes the quantum theory enjoys, the sillier it looks.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos467192" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697352" class="calibre22">49</a></sup></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_33"></div></body>
