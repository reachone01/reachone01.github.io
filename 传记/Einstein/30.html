<p>The problems of the world were important to Einstein, but the problems of the cosmos helped him to keep earthly matters in perspective. Even though he was producing little of scientific significance, physics rather than politics would remain his defining endeavor until the day he died. One morning when walking to work with his scientific assistant and fellow arms control advocate Ernst Straus, Einstein mused at their ability to divide their time between the two realms. “But our equations are much more important to me,” Einstein added. “Politics is for the present, while our equations are for eternity.”<sup><a id="filepos1414058"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1950199">1</a></sup></p>

世界问题固然对爱因斯坦很重要，但宇宙问题有助于他摆正世俗事务的位置。虽然他在去世前再也没能做出什么重要的科学成果，但他所不懈追求的仍然是物理而非政治。一天早上，他步行前往办公室，与支持军控的科学助手施特劳斯一同工作。他对他们如何在两个领域分配时间进行了思考。“但我们的方程对我更重要，”爱因斯坦说，“政治是暂时的，而方程是永恒的。”

<p>Einstein had officially retired from the Institute for Advanced Study at the end of the war, when he turned 66. But he continued to <a id="filepos1414288"></a>work in a small office there every day, and he was still able to enlist the aid of loyal assistants willing to pursue what had come to be considered his quaint quest for a unified field theory.</p>

战争结束时，爱因斯坦66岁，这时他已经正式从高等研究院退休。但他每天仍然在那里的一个小办公室继续工作，而且能够得到忠诚助手的帮助，他们愿意追求那种被视为异类的统一场论。

<p>Each weekday, he would wake at a civilized hour, eat breakfast and read the papers, and then around ten walk slowly up Mercer Street to the Institute, trailing stories both real and apocryphal. His colleague Abraham Pais recalled “one occasion when a car hit a tree after the driver suddenly recognized the face of the beautiful old man walking along the street, the black woolen knit cap firmly planted on his long white hair.”<sup><a id="filepos1414990"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1950336">2</a></sup></p>

平曰里，他每天都会按时醒来，吃早餐，读报，10点钟左右从梅瑟街慢慢走到研究院。这样便衍生出许多虚虚实实的故事。他的同事派斯回忆说：“有一次，一个司机忽然认出了这位正在街上行走的慈祥老人，黑色的毛线帽，紧紧戴在花白的头发上。吃惊之际，他的汽车撞在了树上。”

<p>Soon after the war ended, J. Robert Oppenheimer came from Los Alamos to take over as director of the Institute. A brilliant, chain-smoking theoretical physicist, he proved charismatic and competent enough to be an inspiring leader for the scientists who built the atomic bomb. With his charm and biting wit, he tended to produce either acolytes or enemies, but Einstein fell into neither category. He and Oppenheimer viewed each other with a mixture of amusement and respect, which allowed them to develop a cordial though not close relationship.<sup><a id="filepos1415639"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1950471">3</a></sup></p>

战争结束后不久，奥本海默从洛斯阿拉莫斯来到普林斯顿接任研究院院长。他是一位卓越的理论物理学家，烟不离口，在领导科学家制造原子弹方面有超凡的能力。他的魅力和才智使他既赢得朋友，又树敌甚多，不过爱因斯坦两者都不是。他和奥本海默带着愉快和尊敬看待对方，两人的关系既友好，又不那么亲密。 


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Oppenheimer first visited the Institute in 1935, he called it a “madhouse” with “solipsistic luminaries shining in separate and hapless desolation.” As for the greatest of these luminaries, Oppenheimer declared, “Einstein is completely cuckoo,” though he seemed to mean it in an affectionate way.<sup><a id="filepos1416079"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1950612">4</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

奥本海默1955年第一次访问研究院，那时他称它为“疯人院”，“一群唯我独尊的名人处在孤独无助的凄凉之中”。爱因斯坦无疑是这些名人中最伟大的一位，奥本海默称他是“完全的疯子”，虽然这样说似乎是为了表达一种挚爱。 


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Once they became colleagues, Oppenheimer became more adroit at dealing with his luminous charges and his jabs became more subtle. Einstein, he declared, was “a landmark but not a beacon,” meaning he was admired for his great triumphs but attracted few apostles in his current endeavors, which was true. Years later, he provided another telling description of Einstein: “There was always in him a powerful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.”<sup><a id="filepos1416661"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1950944">5</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

成为同事后，奥本海默在对待爱因斯坦时变得更加灵巧，其话语也变得更加微妙。他称爱因斯坦是“一个里程碑，但不是一座灯塔”，意为人们赞叹他的伟大成就，但极少有人在事业上追随他。事实也的确如此。几年以后，他又对爱因斯坦做了另一番生动描述：“他身上总是透出一种强烈的纯粹性，既如孩子般单纯，又极为坚定。” 



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein became a closer friend, and a walking partner, of another iconic figure at the Institute, the intensely introverted Kurt Gödel, a German-speaking mathematical logician from Brno and Vienna. Gödel was famous for his “incompleteness theory,” a pair of logical <a id="filepos1417048"></a>proofs that purport to show that any useful mathematical system will have some propositions that cannot be proven true or false based on the postulates of that system.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦与研究院极为内向的另一位偶像式人物哥德尔成了密友，他们经常一起步行。哥德尔讲德语，是一位来自布尔诺和维也纳的数理逻辑学家，以其“不完备性定理”而著名。这两条逻辑定理表明，任何有用的数学系统都将包含一些命题，无法根据该系统的假设被证明为真或为假。


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Out of the supercharged German-speaking intellectual world, in which physics and mathematics and philosophy intertwined, three jarring theories of the twentieth century emerged: Einstein’s relativity, Heisenberg’s uncertainty, and Gödel’s incompleteness. The surface similarity of the three words, all of which conjure up a cosmos that is tentative and subjective, oversimplifies the theories and the connections between them. Nevertheless, they all seemed to have philosophical resonance, and this became the topic of discussion when Gödel and Einstein walked to work together.<sup><a id="filepos1417890"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1951181">6</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

人才辈出的德语思想界向来有将物理学和数学与哲学结合在一起的传统，20世纪出现了三种不和谐的理论：爱因斯坦的相对论、海森伯的不确定性原理和哥德尔的不完备性定理。这三个词表面的相似性（都唤来了一个不确定的、主观的宇宙）过度简化了这些理论及其相互关系。不过，它们似乎都对哲学产生了影响，这成了哥德尔和爱因斯坦在前往办公室途中的讨论话题。 


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>They were very different personalities. Einstein was filled with good humor and sagacity, both qualities lacking in Gödel, whose intense logic sometimes overwhelmed common sense. This was on glorious display when Gödel decided to become a U.S. citizen in 1947. He took his preparation for the exam very seriously, studied the Constitution carefully, and (as might be expected by the formulator of the incompleteness theory) found what he believed was a logical flaw. There was an internal inconsistency, he insisted, that could allow the entire government to degenerate into tyranny.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

他们的个性非常不同。爱因斯坦充满了幽默和睿智，这些都是哥德尔所缺乏的，他深刻的逻辑有时会推翻常识。这一点在哥德尔1947年加入美国国籍时表现得淋漓尽致。他非常认真地准备考试，仔细研究宪法，发现了一个他所谓的逻辑缺陷（这倒是符合人们对不完备性理论的提出者的预期）。他坚持说，这种内在的不一致性将使整个政府沧落为专制。


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Concerned, Einstein decided to accompany—or chaperone—Gödel on his visit to Trenton to take the citizenship test, which was to be administered by the same judge who had done so for Einstein. On the drive, he and a third friend tried to distract Gödel and dissuade him from mentioning this perceived flaw, but to no avail. When the judge asked him about the Constitution, Gödel launched into his proof that its internal inconsistency made a dictatorship possible. Fortunately, the judge, who by now cherished his connection to Einstein, cut Gödel off. “You needn’t go into all that,” he said, and Gödel’s citizenship was saved.<sup><a id="filepos1419330"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1951569">7</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦不放心，决定陪同（或陪护）哥德尔到特伦顿参加入籍考试，主考官正是给爱因斯坦考试的那位法官。他和另一位朋友在途中试图让哥德尔分散精力，劝他不要提这个缺陷，但不管用。当主考官问他对宪法有何看法时，哥德尔开始论证其内在的不一致性有可能会导致独裁。幸运的是，考虑到他与爱因斯坦的关系，主考官及时打断了他。“你不必详谈了。”他说。哥德尔的国籍保住了。 


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>During their walks, Gödel explored some of the implications of relativity theory, and he came up with an analysis that called into question whether time, rather than merely being relative, could be said to exist at all. Einstein’s equations, he figured, could describe a universe that was rotating rather than (or in addition to) expanding. In such a case, the <a id="filepos1419800"></a>relationship between space and time could become, mathematically, mixed up. “The existence of an objective lapse of time,” he wrote, “means that reality consists of an infinity of layers of ‘now’ which come into existence successively. But if simultaneity is something relative, each observer has his own set of ‘nows,’ and none of these various layers can claim the prerogative of representing the objective lapse of time.”<sup><a id="filepos1420284"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1951830">8</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

哥德尔研究了相对论的一些推论。通过分析，他不仅认为时间是相对的，甚至对是否可以说有时间这种东西存在都表示怀疑。他指出，爱因斯坦的方程可以描述一个旋转的而非（或同时）膨胀的宇宙。在这种情况下，空间与时间的关系将在数学上混在一起。他写道：“存在着时间的客观流逝意味着，实在是由相继产生的无穷多个‘现在’构成的。然而如果同时性是相对的，那么每一个观察者都有他自己的‘现在’，没有哪一组‘现在’有权代表时间的客观流逝。” 


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As a result, Gödel argued, time travel would be possible. “By making a round trip on a rocket ship in a sufficiently wide curve, it is possible in these worlds to travel into any region of the past, present and future, and back again.” That would be absurd, he noted, because then we could go back and chat with a younger version of ourselves (or, even more discomforting, our older version could come back and chat with us). “Gödel had achieved an amazing demonstration that time travel, strictly understood, was consistent with the theory of relativity,” writes Boston University philosophy professor Palle Yourgrau in his book on Gödel’s relationship with Einstein, <em>World Without Time.</em> “The primary result was a powerful argument that if time travel is possible, time itself is not.”<sup><a id="filepos1421239"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1952035">9</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


哥德尔的结论是，时间旅行是可能的。“在这些世界中，只要乘坐宇宙飞船沿着足够宽广的曲线做一次往返旅行，就有可能进入过去、现在和未来的任何区域，然后再回来。”他认为这很荒谬，因为那样一来，我们就可以回去与年轻时的我们聊天（或者更糟的是，老年的我们会回来与我们聊天）。“哥德尔令人惊讶地表明，严格意义上的时间旅行与相对论是一致的，”波士顿大学哲学教授帕勒·尤格劳在关于哥德尔与爱因斯坦关系的书《没有时间的世界》（World Without Time）中说，“其主要结果是强有力地证明了，如果时间旅行是可能的，那么时间本身就不存在。” 

</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein responded to Gödel’s essay along with a variety of others that had been collected in a book, and he seemed to be mildly impressed but also not totally engaged by the argument. In his brief assessment, Einstein called Gödel’s “an important contribution” but noted that he had thought of the issue long ago and “the problem here involved disturbed me already.” He implied that although time travel may be true as a mathematical conceivability, it might not be possible in reality.“It will be interesting to weigh whether these are not to be excluded on physical grounds,” Einstein concluded.<sup><a id="filepos1421998"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1952181">10</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦对哥德尔的论证很钦佩，但兴趣并不大。他简短地评价说，这是“一项重要贡献”，但他很早以前就思考过这个问题，“这里所涉及的问题已经困扰过我”。他暗示，虽然时间旅行在数学上可以设想为真，但在现实中是不可能的。“看看能否基于物理的理由将它们排除是很有趣的。”爱因斯坦说。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For his part, Einstein remained focused on his own white whale, which he pursued not with the demonic drive of Ahab but the dutiful serenity of Ishmael. In his quest for a unified field theory, he still had no compelling physical insight—such as the equivalence of gravity and acceleration, or the relativity of simultaneity—to guide his way, so his endeavors remained a groping through clouds of abstract mathematical equations with no ground lights to orient him. “It’s like being in an airship in which one can cruise around in the clouds but cannot see <a id="filepos1422678"></a>clearly how one can return to reality, i.e., earth,” he lamented to a friend.<sup><a id="filepos1422773"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1952373">11</a></sup></p>

至于他自己，则仍在努力完成那个艰巨的任务。他的求索并非凭借亚哈（Ahab） 魔鬼般的冲动，而是带着以实玛利（Ishmael） 的忠诚与镇定。在探索统一场论的过程中，他一直没有获得像引力与加速等效，或同时的相对性那样令人信服的物理洞见，所以他仍然是在抽象的数学方程中苦苦摸索，没有航标灯为他导向。“这就像置身于一艘飞艇中，虽然可以在云端游弋，却看不清如何才能回到现实中的地球。”他对朋友悲叹道。

<p>His goal, as it had been for decades, was to come up with a theory that encompassed both the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields, but he had no compelling reason to believe that they in fact <em>had</em> to be part of the same unified structure, other than his intuition that nature liked the beauty of simplicity.</p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

他数十年来的目标始终如一，那就是提出一种能够同时包含电磁场和引力场的理论。然而，认为它们必须同属于一种统一的结构，这只是他的直觉，即自然喜欢美和简单性，除此之外并无令人信服的理由。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Likewise, he was still hoping to explain the existence of particles in terms of a field theory by finding permissible pointlike solutions to his field equations. “He argued that if one believed wholeheartedly in the basic idea of a field theory, matter should enter not as an interloper but as an honest part of the field itself,” recalled one of his Princeton collaborators, Banesh Hoffmann. “Indeed, one might say that he wanted to build matter out of nothing but convolutions of spacetime.” In the process he used all sorts of mathematical devices, but constantly searched for others. “I need more mathematics,” he lamented at one point to Hoffmann.<sup><a id="filepos1423945"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1952545">12</a></sup></p>

<p>
他也希望能够找到他的场方程可以允许的点状解，从而用场论说明粒子的存在。“他认为，如果我们对场论的基本观念深信不疑，那么物质就应当是场的实实在在的一部分，而不应强行加入进来，”他在普林斯顿的合作者霍夫曼回忆说，“事实上，或者可以说他希望仅仅从时空弯曲把物质构建出来。”在这一过程中，他使用了各种数学手段，但仍觉不够。“我需要更多的数学。”他曾向霍夫曼抱怨说。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Why did he persist? Deep inside, such disjunctures and dualities—different field theories for gravity and electromagnetism, distinctions between particles and fields—had always discomforted him. Simplicity and unity, he intuitively believed, were hallmarks of the Old One’s handiwork. “A theory is more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises, the more different things it relates, and the more expanded its area of applicability,” he wrote.<sup><a id="filepos1424534"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1952685">13</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


他为什么坚持这样做？引力场理论与电磁场理论的差异，粒子与场的区分，这些分裂和二元性一直都使他的内心感到不安。他直觉地感到，简单性和统一性是“老头子”（Old One）的产品特征。“一种理论的前提的简单性越大，所涉及的事物的种类越多，应用范围越广，它给人的印象也就越深。”他写道。 

</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In the early 1940s, Einstein returned for a while to the five-dimensional mathematical approach that he had adopted from Theodor Kaluza two decades earlier. He even worked on it with Wolfgang Pauli, the quantum mechanics pioneer, who had spent some of the war years in Princeton. But he could not get his equations to describe particles.<sup><a id="filepos1424975"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1952825">14</a></sup></p>

20世纪40年代初，爱因斯坦暂时回到了他20年前从卡鲁扎那里得知的五维的数学方案。他甚至同量子力学的先驱泡利一起做了研究，泡利在战争期间曾在普林斯顿待过几年。但所得到的方程仍然无法描述粒子。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So he moved on to a strategy dubbed “bivector fields.” Einstein seemed to be getting a little desperate. This new approach, he admitted, might require surrendering the principle of locality that he had sanctified in some of his thought-experiments assaulting quantum mechanics.<sup><a id="filepos1425368"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1953062">15</a></sup> In any event, it was soon abandoned as well.</p>

于是他继而采取了“双向量场”方案。爱因斯坦似乎变得有些孤注一掷。他承认，这种新方案可能要求放弃他在攻击量子力学的一些思想实验中所认可的定域性原理。 无论如何，这种方案不久也被放弃了。

<p>Einstein’s final strategy, which he pursued for the final decade of his <a id="filepos1425590"></a>life, was a resurrection of one he had tried during the 1920s.

<p>Einstein sent early versions of this work to his old comrade Schrödinger. “I am sending them to nobody else, because you are the only person known to me who is not wearing blinders in regard to the fundamental questions in our science,” Einstein wrote. “The attempt depends on an idea that at first seems antiquated and unprofitable, the introduction of a non-symmetrical tensor ... Pauli stuck his tongue out at me when I told him about it.”<sup><a id="filepos1426396"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1953338">16</a></sup></p>

他把早期的工作成果寄给了老同事薛定谔。“我只把它寄给了你，因为你是我所知道的唯一能够看清楚我们科学中基本问题的人，”爱因斯坦写道，“这一尝试所依赖的思想初看起来有些过时，似乎用处不大，即引入一种非对称张量……我把这种想法告诉泡利时，他朝我吐了吐舌头。”

<p>Einstein was thrilled with such support. “This correspondence gives me great joy,” he replied, “because you are my closest brother and your brain runs so similarly to mine.” But he soon began to realize that the gossamer theories he was spinning were mathematically elegant but never seemed to relate to anything physical. “Inwardly I am not so certain as I previously asserted,” he confessed to Schrödinger a few months later. “We have squandered a lot of time on this, and the result looks like a gift from the devil’s grandmother.”<sup><a id="filepos1427308"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1953520">17</a></sup></p>

这种支持让爱因斯坦很激动。“这封信使我欢欣鼓舞，”他回信说，“因为你是我最亲密的兄弟，我们的想法很类似。”可惜没过多久他就意识到，这种尚未成形的脆弱理论虽然在数学上很优雅，但似乎无法与任何物理的东西联系在一起。“从我内心来讲，我对它不像以前那样肯定了，”他几个月后向薛定谔坦言，“我们在这上面耗费了许多时间，得到的结果却像是魔鬼的祖母给予的礼物。”

<p>And yet he soldiered on, churning out papers and producing the occasional headline. When a new edition of his book, <em>The Meaning of Relativity,</em> was being prepared in 1949, he added the latest version of the paper he had shown Schrödinger as an appendix. The <em>New York Times</em> reprinted an entire page of complex equations from the manuscript, along with a front-page story headlined “New Einstein Theory Gives a Master Key to Universe: Scientist, after 30 Years’ Work, Evolves Concept That Promises to Bridge Gap between the Star and the Atom.”<sup><a id="filepos1427993"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1953916">18</a></sup></p>

不过，他仍然迎难而上，艰苦地写出了几篇论文，偶尔还上了新闻大标题。当《相对论的意义》一书于1949年再版时，他把给薛定谔看的论文的最新版本《引力理论的推广》作为附录补充了进去。《纽约时报》用一整版的篇幅刊登了手稿中复杂的方程，并在头版配以大标题“爱因斯坦的新理论是宇宙的万能钥匙；经过30年的工作，科学家提出了可以沟通星体与原子的概念”。

<p>In fact, he continued to revise the theory repeatedly, but to no avail. His growing pessimism was visible in the lamentations he sent to his old friend from the Olympia Academy days, Maurice Solovine, then <a id="filepos1428557"></a>Einstein’s publisher in Paris. “I shall never ever solve it,” he wrote in 1948. “It will be forgotten and must later be rediscovered again.”Then, the following year: “I am uncertain as to whether I was even on the right track. The current generation sees in me both a heretic and a reactionary who has, so to speak, outlived himself.” And, with some resignation, in 1951: “The unified field theory has been put into retirement. It is so difficult to employ mathematically that I have not been able to verify it. This state of affairs will last for many more years, mainly because physicists have no understanding of logical and philosophical arguments.”<sup><a id="filepos1429276"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1954465">19</a></sup></p>

事实上，他对理论一再进行修改，但都没有成功。他的悲观情绪日渐浓厚，这可见于他给老友索洛文（当时在巴黎做爱因斯坦的出版商）的信。“这个问题我永远解决不了了，”他1948年写道，“它将被遗忘，以后肯定会被重新发现。”一年后他又说：“我不敢肯定我走的路是否正确。我的同时代的人把我看成异端和叛逆分子，因为自己活久了人们已把我忘了。”1951年，他有些无奈地说：“统一场论的研究已经不再进行了。它在数学上过于困难，我无法证明它。这种情况还将持续很多年，主要是因为物理学家们不理解逻辑和哲学论证。”

<p>Einstein’s quest for a unified theory was destined to produce no tangible results that added to the framework of physics. He was able to come up with no great insights or thought experiments, no intuitions about underlying principles, to help him visualize his goal. “No pictures came to our aid,” his collaborator Hoffmann lamented. “It is intensely mathematical, and over the years, with helpers and alone, Einstein surmounted difficulty after difficulty, only to find new ones awaiting him.”<sup><a id="filepos1429904"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1954756">20</a></sup></p>

爱因斯坦对统一理论的求索注定不会给物理学体系带来什么切实的成果。他没能获得什么伟大的洞见或思想实验，直觉不到背后的原理来帮助他实现目标。“没有图像能够帮助我们。”他的合作者霍夫曼悲叹道，“它的数学非常高深。多年以来，或是和助手一起，或是孤身一人，爱因斯坦克服了一个又一个困难，最后发现还有新的困难在等待着他。”

<p>Perhaps the search was futile. And if it turns out a century from now that there is indeed no unified theory to be found, it will also look misconceived. But Einstein never regretted his dedication to it. When a colleague asked him one day why he was spending—perhaps squandering—his time in this lonely endeavor, he replied that even if the chance of finding a unified theory was small, the attempt was worthy. He had already made his name, he noted. His position was secure, and he could afford to take the risk and expend the time. A younger theorist, however, could not take such a risk, for he might thus sacrifice a promising career. So, Einstein said, it was his duty to do it.<sup><a id="filepos1430704"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1955117">21</a></sup></p>

也许这种探索是徒劳的。假如再过一个世纪仍然找不到统一理论，那么它仍将受到误解。但爱因斯坦从不后悔他的努力。有一天，一位同事问他为什么要把时间花在（也许是浪费在）这项孤独的事业中，他回答说，即使找到统一理论的希望很渺茫，这种努力也很值得。他说自己已经功成名就，不必担心丢掉饭碗，花时间冒这个险还担负得起。但年轻理论家这样做就太危险了，因为他很可能会因此而毁掉自己的前途。于是爱因斯坦说，自己有义务这样做。

One afternoon he came by Mercer Street to explain a new approach to quantum theory (known as the sum-over-histories approach) that he was developing with his graduate student, Richard Feynman. “I had gone to Einstein with the hope to persuade him of the naturalness of the quantum theory when seen in this new light,” Wheeler recalled.

他从佛罗里达疗养回来后，在人们为他举行的70岁生日宴会上，他感受到了那种事业和生活上的友情，从学生时代起，这种友情就一直伴随着他。尽管按照预定的计划，讨论的话题本应集中在爱因斯坦的科学，但大多数人还是谈了他的可爱和善良。当他步入会场时，人们安静了下来，接着爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。“爱因斯坦根本不知道人们对他有多么敬重。”他的一位助手回忆说。

<p>His closest friends at the Institute bought him a present, an advanced AM-FM radio and high-fidelity record player, which they installed in his home secretly when he was at work one day.

<p>He had pretty much given up the violin by then. It was too hard on his aging fingers. Instead, he focused on the piano, which he was not quite as good at playing.

那时他已经基本上不再演奏小提琴，他老迈的手指已经很难完成这项任务。他转而弹奏自己并不十分擅长的钢琴。有一次，有一节旋律总是弹不过去，他转回头看了看玛戈特，笑着说：“莫扎特在这里乱写一气。”

<p>Before the Second World War, Einstein had stated his opposition to a Jewish state when speaking to three thousand celebrants at a Manhattan hotel seder. “My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power,” he said. “I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our ranks. We are no longer the Jews of the Maccabee period.”<sup><a id="filepos1446267"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1960237">40</a></sup></p>

第二次世界大战以前，爱因斯坦曾经在曼哈顿的康莫多旅馆举行的逾越节庆祝会上向3000位来宾致辞，反对建立犹太国。“我所认识到的犹太民族的本性是同一个有着边界、军队和世俗权力的犹太国的思想相抵触的，”他说，“我担心对犹太教的内部损害——特别是我们自己的队伍中发展起来的一种狭隘的民族主义所造成的损害——会持续下去。我们已经不再是马加比（Maccabee） 时代的犹太人了。”

<p>After the war, he took the same stance. When he testified in Washington in 1946 to an international committee looking into the situation in Palestine, he denounced the British for pitting Jews against Arabs, called for more Jewish immigration, but rejected the idea that the Jews should be nationalistic. “The State idea is not in my heart,” he said in a quiet whisper that reverberated through the shocked audience of ardent Zionists. “I cannot understand why it is needed.”<sup><a id="filepos1446870"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1960517">41</a></sup> Rabbi Stephen Wise was flabbergasted that Einstein would break ranks with true Zionists at such a public hearing, and he got him to sign a clarifying statement that was, in fact, not clarifying at all.</p>

战后，他的立场依然没有改变。1946年，他在华盛顿向一个研究巴勒斯坦局势的国际委员会作证时，指责英国人挑拨犹太人与阿拉伯人的关系，呼吁让更多的犹太人移民入境，但并不认为犹太人应当组建一个国家。“国家的观念与我的看法不符，”他说话的声音虽然不高，却在热情的犹太复国主义者听众中引起强烈震动，“我不明白为什么要这样做， 爱因斯坦竟然在这样一种公开的听证会上背叛犹太复国主义者，这让犹太拉比怀斯大吃一惊。他最终让爱因斯坦签署了一份声明进行澄清，尽管它事实上什么也没有澄清。

<p>Einstein was especially dismayed by the militaristic methods used by Menachem Begin and other Jewish militia leaders, and he joined with his occasional antagonist Sidney Hook to sign a petition in the <em>New York Times</em> denouncing Begin as a “terrorist” and “closely akin” to the fascists.<sup><a id="filepos1447494"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1960856">42</a></sup> The violence was contrary to Jewish heritage. “We imitate the stupid nationalism and racial nonsense of the goyim,” he wrote a friend in 1947.</p>

爱因斯坦对梅纳赫姆·贝京等犹太军事领导人使用的军国主义方法倍感沮丧，他与昔日的对手胡克在《纽约时报》上联名签署了一份请愿书，指责贝京是“恐怖分子”，与法西斯主义者“非常类似”。 暴力与犹太传统相违背。“我们仿效着愚蠢的国家主义和异教徒的种族谬论。”他在1947年给一个朋友的信中说。

<p>But when the State of Israel was declared in 1948, Einstein wrote the same friend to say that his attitude had changed. “I have never considered the idea of a state a good one, for economic, political and military reasons,” he conceded. “But now, there is no going back, and one has to fight it out.”<sup><a id="filepos1448077"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1961162">43</a></sup></p>

然而当以色列1948年宣布建国时，爱因斯坦又写信给这位朋友说，他的态度发生了转变。“出于经济、政治、军事上的理由，我从不认为国家是一个好的概念，”他承认，“但是现在，我们别无退路，只能以斗争方式解决问题。”

<p><a id="filepos1448176"></a>The creation of Israel caused him, yet again, to back away from the pure pacifism he had once embraced. “We may regret that we have to use methods that are repulsive and stupid to us,” he wrote to a Jewish group in Uruguay, “but to bring about better conditions in the international sphere, we must first of all maintain our experience by all means at our disposal.”<sup><a id="filepos1448578"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1961367">44</a></sup></p>

以色列的建国也使他又一次背离了曾经拥护的纯粹的和平主义。“我们也许会后悔不得不使用一些在我们看来可憎而愚蠢的方法，”他写信给乌拉圭的一个犹太团体，“但是为了使国际状况有所改善，我们必须首先尽自己的一切力量维持我们的经验。”

<p>Chaim Weizmann, the indefatigable Zionist who brought Einstein to America in 1921, had become Israel’s first president, a prestigious but generally ceremonial post in a system that vested most power in the prime minister and cabinet. When he died in November 1952, a Jerusalem newspaper began urging that Einstein be tapped to replace him. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion bowed to the pressure, and word quickly spread that Einstein would be asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
1921年，魏茨曼带爱因斯坦来到美国。他终生致力于犹太复国主义运动，当选以色列第一任总统。在既定体制中，总理及其内阁握有更大的权力，总统虽然声望很高，但没有实权。1952年11月，魏茨曼去世，有一份耶路撒冷的报纸呼吁让爱因斯坦来接任他。在压力面前，总理本-古里安不得不做出妥协，他迅速放出话来，会征询爱因斯坦的意见。


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was an idea that was at once both astonishing and obvious—and also impractical. Einstein first learned of it from a small article in the <em>New York Times</em> a week after Weizmann’s death. At first he and the women in his house laughed it off, but then reporters started to call. “This is very awkward, very awkward,” he told a visitor. A few hours later, a telegram arrived from Israel’s ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban. Could the embassy, it asked, send someone the next day to see him officially?</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

这种想法既令人惊讶，同时也不现实。爱因斯坦是在魏茨曼去世一周后，在《纽约时报》的一篇小文中得知这一提议的。起初，他们一家人权当是个笑话，但没过多久，记者开始打电话了。“这真让人难堪。”他对一位来访者说。几小时以后，以色列驻华盛顿大使阿巴·埃班发来了一份电报，问大使馆可否第二天正式派人来看他。



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“Why should that man come all that way,” Einstein lamented, “when I only will have to say no?”</p>

“既然我肯定不会同意，那个人干吗还要大老远跑来？”爱因斯坦说。

<div class="left">
<p>Helen Dukas came up with the idea of simply giving Ambassador Eban a phone call. In those days, impromptu long-distance calls were somewhat novel. To her surprise, she was able to track Eban down in Washington and put him on the line with Einstein.</p>

杜卡斯决定给埃班大使打电话说明情况。在那个时候，即兴的长途电话还是比较新奇的。让她没有想到的是，她竟然联系上了华盛顿的埃班，然后把话筒交给爱因斯坦。


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“I am not the person for that and I cannot possibly do it,” Einstein said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
“我不是合适的人选，不可能去担任。”爱因斯坦说。


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>“I cannot tell my government that you phoned me and said no,” Eban replied. “I have to go through the motions and present the offer officially.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
“我不能跟我的上司说，你给我打了电话表示不同意，”埃班答道，“我只能装装样子，正式发出这份邀请。”


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Eban ended up sending a deputy, who handed Einstein a formal letter asking if he would take on the presidency. “Acceptance would entail moving to Israel and taking its citizenship,” Eban’s letter noted (presumably in case Einstein harbored any fantasy that he could preside <a id="filepos1450924"></a>over Israel from Princeton). Eban hastened to reassure Einstein, however: “Freedom to pursue your great scientific work would be afforded by a government and people who are fully conscious of the supreme significance of your labors.” In other words, it was a job that would require his presence, but not much else.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

最后，埃班派了一个代表，交给爱因斯坦一封正式信函，问他是否愿意出任总统。“接受这一职位就意味着必须搬到以色列，加入以色列国籍。”埃班在信上说（也许是为了防止爱因斯坦幻想能够在普林斯顿管理以色列）不过接下来还有安抚的话：“在此情况下，以色列政府和人民将为让您从事您的伟大的科学研究工作提供全部的便利和自由，他们完全理解您工作的重大意义。”换句话说，这一职位只要求他挂个名字，而不要求他做很多工作。

</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Even though the offer seemed somewhat strange, it was a powerful testament to Einstein’s unsurpassed standing as a hero of world Jewry. It “embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons,” Eban said.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
虽然这份邀请似乎有些奇怪，但它有力地证明了爱因斯坦是犹太世界无与伦比的英雄。它“体现了犹太人民所能给予她的子民的最深敬意”，埃班说。



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein had already prepared his note of rejection, which he handed to Eban’s envoy as soon as he arrived. “I have been a lawyer all my life,” the visitor joked, “and I have never gotten a rebuttal before I have stated my case.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
埃班的特使一到，爱因斯坦就把已经准备好的拒信交给了他。特使开玩笑说：“我做了一辈子律师，从未见过在陈述案情之前就被驳回的。”



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He was “deeply moved” by the offer, Einstein said in his prepared response, and “at once saddened and ashamed” that he would not accept it. “All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people and to exercise official function,” he explained. “I am the more distressed over these circumstances because my relationship with the Jewish people became my strongest human tie once I achieved complete clarity about our precarious position among the nations of the world.”<sup><a id="filepos1452543"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1961543">45</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦在回信中说，这一邀请使他“深为感动”，对自己不能接受它“感到悲伤和羞愧”。“我终生都在同客观事物打交道，缺乏天生的资质和经验与人民打交道，做官处理世事，”他解释说，“与犹太人民的血脉联系是我一生中最亲切、最强烈的心理寄托。特别是当我意识到，在世界各国中我们的处境还不稳定，这更加使我感到痛苦。”

</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Offering Einstein the presidency of Israel was a clever idea, but Einstein was right to realize that sometimes a brilliant idea is also a very bad one. As he noted with his usual wry self-awareness, he did not have the natural aptitude to deal with people in the way the role would require, nor did he have the temperament to be an official functionary. He was not cut out to be either a statesman or a figurehead.</p>

邀请爱因斯坦做以色列总统的主意很聪明，但爱因斯坦正确地意识到，有时一个出色的想法同时也是很糟糕的。正如他以惯有的调侃语气所说，他既没有与人民打交道的天生资质，也不适合做官。他天生就不适合做政治家或领袖。

<p>He liked to speak his mind, and he had no patience for the compromises necessary to manage, or even symbolically lead, complex organizations. Back when he was involved as a figurehead leader in the establishing of Hebrew University, he had not possessed the talent to handle, nor the temperament to ignore, all of the maneuverings involved. Likewise, he had more recently had the same unpleasant experiences with a group creating Brandeis University near Boston, which caused him to resign from that endeavor.<sup><a id="filepos1453627"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1961794">46</a></sup></p>

他喜欢谈论自己的思想，没有耐心为管理（甚或象征性地领导）复杂的机构而做出必要的妥协。在希伯来大学创建之初，他担任了有名无实的领导人。他的性情决定了他做不到对各种权谋伎俩视而不见。与此类似，最近有一个组织在波士顿附近筹建布兰迪斯大学，他在与他们打交道时也有同样不愉快的经历，这使他辞去了相关职务。

<p>Einstein’s brilliance sprang from being a rebel and nonconformist who recoiled at any attempt to restrain his free expression. Are there any worse traits for someone who is supposed to be a political conciliator?

<p>Ben-Gurion was secretly relieved. He had begun to realize that the idea was a bad one. “Tell me what to do if he says yes!” he joked to his assistant. “I’ve had to offer the post to him because it’s impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.” Two days later, when Ambassador Eban ran into Einstein at a black-tie reception in New York, he was happy that the issue was behind them.
