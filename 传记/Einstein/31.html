<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The rush to build the H-Bomb, rising anticommunist fervor, and Senator Joseph McCarthy’s increasingly untethered security investigations unnerved Einstein. The atmosphere reminded him of the rising Nazism and anti-Semitism of the 1930s. “The German calamity of years ago repeats itself,” he lamented to the queen mother of Belgium in early 1951. “People acquiesce without resistance and align themselves with the forces for evil.”<sup><a id="filepos1456556"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1963141">1</a></sup></p>

<p>
氢弹的研制工作紧锣密鼓地进行，反共声浪愈演愈烈，参议员麦卡锡鼓吹的安全调查越来越肆无忌惮，所有这些都使爱因斯坦感到不安。这使他想起了20世纪30年代纳粹的上台和反犹主义的兴起。“几十年前德国的灾难正在重演，”他1951年年初向比利时王后悲叹道，“人们一味纵容默许，而不做任何抵抗，甘愿与恶势力为伍。”

<p>He tried to maintain a middle ground between those who were reflexively anti-American and those who were reflexively anti-Soviet. On the one hand, he rebuked his collaborator Leopold Infeld, who wanted him to support statements by the World Peace Council, which Einstein rightly suspected was Soviet-influenced. “In my view they are <a id="filepos1456993"></a>more or less propaganda,” he said. He did the same to a group of Russian students who pressed him to join a protest against what they alleged was America’s use of biological weapons during the Korean War. “You cannot expect me to protest against incidents which possibly, and very probably, have never taken place,” he replied.<sup><a id="filepos1457356"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1963333">2</a></sup></p>

他试图在反美和反苏人士之间保持中立。一方面，他的合作者英菲尔德希望他支持世界和平委员会的声明，他（正确地）怀疑这个委员会是受苏联操纵的，没有答应。“在我看来，这多多少少是一种宣传。”他说。一群苏联学生恳请他一同抗议所谓美国在朝鲜战争期间使用生物武器，他也同样予以批驳。“你们不能指望我抗议那些或许（而且十有八九）从未发生过的事情。”他回复说。 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On the other hand, Einstein refrained from signing a petition circulated by Sidney Hook denouncing the perfidy of those who made such charges against America. He was enamored of neither extreme. As he put it, “Every reasonable person must strive to promote moderation and a more objective judgment.”<sup><a id="filepos1457770"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1963573">3</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
另一方面，爱因斯坦也不愿在胡克散发的一份请愿书上签字，该请愿书斥责那些如此指控美国的人不够诚实。他不落于任何一个极端。正如他所说：“每一位有识之士都必须努力促进缓和，做出更为客观的判断。” 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In what he presumed would be a quiet effort at promoting such moderation, Einstein wrote a private letter asking that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted of turning over atomic secrets to the Soviets, be spared the death penalty. He had avoided making any statements about the case, which had divided the nation with a frenzy seldom seen before the advent of the cable-TV age. Instead, he sent the letter to the judge, Irving Kaufman, with a promise not to publicize it. Einstein did not contend that the Rosenbergs were innocent. He merely argued that a death penalty was too harsh in a case where the facts were murky and the outcome was driven more by popular hysteria than objectivity.<sup><a id="filepos1458577"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1963744">4</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

为了不动声色地推进这种缓和，爱因斯坦写了一封私人信件，要求不要判朱利叶斯·罗森伯格和埃塞尔·罗森伯格死刑，他们被控将核机密泄露给了苏联人。此案已经使国家分成了激烈对立的两派，这在有线电视时代到来之前是很罕见的。爱因斯坦没有对这个案子发表任何看法。他将信寄给了主审法官欧文·考夫曼，并请他不要公布信的内容。他并没有说罗森伯格夫妇是清白的，他只是认为，对于这样一个案子来说，死刑过于严厉了，因为它的事实模糊不清，判决结果更多是受民众的狂热而非客观性所驱使。 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>In a reflection of the tenor of the time, Judge Kaufman took the private letter and turned it over to the FBI. Not only was it put into Einstein’s file, but it was investigated to see if it could be construed as disloyalty. After three months, a report was sent to Hoover saying no further incriminating evidence had been found, but the letter remained in the file.<sup><a id="filepos1459051"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1963924">5</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
毫不奇怪，考夫曼法官把这封私人信件交给了联邦调查局。它不仅被收入爱因斯坦档案，而且遭到仔细审查，看它是否属于不忠之举。三个月后，一份报告送到了胡佛手中，说没有找到进一步的指控证据，不过这封信仍然放在爱因斯坦档案里。 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When Judge Kaufman went ahead and imposed a death penalty, Einstein wrote to President Harry Truman, who was about to leave office, to ask him to commute the sentence. He drafted the letter first in German and then in English on the back of a piece of scrap paper that he had filled with a variety of equations that apparently, given how they trail off, led to nothing.<sup><a id="filepos1459523"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1964132">6</a></sup> Truman bucked the decision to incoming President Eisenhower, who allowed the executions to proceed.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
由于考夫曼法官执意判决死刑，爱因斯坦给即将离任的杜鲁门总统写信，请求减刑。他在一张写满方程（显然没有得出任何结果）的纸的背面先用德语后又用英语起草了这封信。 杜鲁门把决定权交给了继任的艾森豪威尔总统，而艾森豪威尔则维持了死刑判决。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein’s letter to Truman was released publicly, and the <em>New York Times</em> ran a front-page story headlined “Einstein Supports Rosenberg <a id="filepos1459878"></a>Appeal.”<sup><a id="filepos1459904"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1964355">7</a></sup> More than a hundred angry letters swept in from across the nation. “You need some common sense plus some appreciation for what America has given you,” wrote Marian Rawles of Portsmouth, Virginia. “You place the Jew first and the United States second,” said Charles Williams of White Plains, New York. From Corporal Homer Greene, serving in Korea: “You evidently like to see our GI’s killed. Go to Russia or back where you came from, because I don’t like Americans like you living off this country and making un-American statements.”<sup><a id="filepos1460531"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1964515">8</a></sup></p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦给杜鲁门的信最终被公之于众，《纽约时报》在头版做了报道，大标题为“爱因斯坦支持罗森伯格上诉”。 100多封愤怒的信从全国各地纷至沓来。“你需要一些常识，外加对美国的恩惠心存感激。”弗吉尼亚朴茨茅斯的玛丽安·罗尔斯写道。“你把犹太人放在第一位，而把美国放在第二位。”纽约怀特普莱恩斯（White Plains）的查尔斯·威廉斯说。在朝鲜服役的下士霍默·格林说：“你显然希望看到我们美国兵被杀掉。去苏联吧，或者回你的老家，因为我不喜欢你这样的美国人既靠这个国家生活，又发表反美言论。” 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There were not as many positive letters, but Einstein did have a pleasant exchange with the liberal Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who had unsuccessfully tried to stop the executions.“You have struggled so devotedly for the creation of a healthy public opinion in our troubled time,” Einstein wrote in a note of appreciation. Douglas sent back a handwritten reply: “You have paid me a tribute which brightens the burdens of this dark hour—a tribute I will always cherish.”<sup><a id="filepos1461147"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1964851">9</a></sup></p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


持肯定意见的信件并不多，不过爱因斯坦与最高法院法官威廉·道格拉斯进行了愉快的通信。道格拉斯试图阻止执行死刑，但没有成功。“为了在我们这个不安的时代创造一种健康的舆论，您已经尽心尽力了。”爱因斯坦写信表示赞赏。道格拉斯回信说：“您对我的褒扬使这段黑暗的时间光亮起来，我将永远铭记在心。” 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Many of the critical letters asked Einstein why he was willing to speak out for the Rosenbergs but not for the nine Jewish doctors whom Stalin had put on trial as part of an alleged Zionist conspiracy to murder Russian leaders. Among those who publicly challenged what they saw as Einstein’s double standard were the publisher of the <em>New York Post</em> and the editor of the <em>New Leader.</em><sup><a id="filepos1461655"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1965082">10</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


许多批评信质问爱因斯坦，为何为罗森伯格夫妇辩护，却不愿为被斯大林投入监牢的九位犹太医生讲好话，这几个犹太人被指控参与了犹太复国主义者暗杀苏联领导人的阴谋。《纽约邮报》的出版人和《新领袖》的编辑都公开指责爱因斯坦坚持双重标准。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein agreed that the Russian actions should be denounced. “The perversion of justice which manifests itself in all the official trials staged by the Russian government deserves unconditional condemnation,” he wrote. He added that individual appeals to Stalin would probably not do much, but perhaps a joint declaration from a group of scholars would help. So he got together with the chemistry Nobel laureate Harold Urey and others to issue one. “Einstein and Urey Hit Reds’ Anti-Semitism,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported.<sup><a id="filepos1462321"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1965313">11</a></sup> (After Stalin died a few weeks later, the doctors were freed.)</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦也认为苏联的行为应当受到谴责。“苏联政府在所有官方审讯中对正义的扭曲应当毫无保留地予以谴责。”他写道。他又说，个人向斯大林呼吁可能不会起什么作用，也许一群学者发表联合声明会有帮助。于是，他联合诺贝尔化学奖得主哈罗德·尤里等人发表了联合声明。“爱因斯坦和尤里打击了共产主义者的反犹主义。”《纽约时报》报道。 （几周以后，斯大林逝世，那些医生被释放。）

<div class="left">
<p>On the other hand, he stressed in scores of letters and statements that Americans should not let the fear of communism cause them to surrender the civil liberties and freedom of thought that they cherished. There were a lot of domestic communists in England, but the people there did not get themselves whipped into a frenzy by internal security investigations, he pointed out. Americans need not either.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

另一方面，他在许多信件和声明中都强调，美国人不应由于害怕共产主义而放弃他们所珍视的公民自由和思想自由。他指出，在英国国内有更多的共产主义者，但那里的人并没有因国内的安全调查而陷入狂乱。美国人也不必如此。

<p>Every year, Lord &amp; Taylor department stores gave an award that, especially in the early 1950s, might have seemed unusual. It honored independent thinking, and Einstein, fittingly, won it in 1953 for his “nonconformity” in scientific matters.</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein took pride in that trait, which he knew had served him well over the years. “It gives me great pleasure to see the stubbornness of an incorrigible nonconformist warmly acclaimed,” he said in his radio talk accepting the award.</p>

爱因斯坦对这一特点感到自豪，他知道自己多年来得益于此甚多。“看到一个无可救药的标新立异者的顽固受到大家的热情赞许，确实让我感到莫大的愉快。”他在接受这一奖项的广播讲话中说。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Even though he was being honored for his nonconformity in the field of science, Einstein used the occasion to turn attention to the McCarthy-style investigations. For him, freedom in the realm of thought was linked to freedom in the realm of politics. “To be sure, we are concerned here with nonconformism in a remote field of endeavor,” he said, meaning physics. “No Senatorial committee has as yet felt compelled to tackle the task of combating in this field the dangers that threaten the inner security of the uncritical or intimidated citizen.”<sup><a id="filepos1464272"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1965526">12</a></sup></p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

尽管是因为在科学领域的标新立异而获此殊荣，但爱因斯坦利用这一场合谈到了麦卡锡式的调查。“当然，大家是在对一个冷僻领域（物理学）中的标新立异者欢呼，在这一领域，参议院尚未感到有必要抗击国内缺乏批判力或胆小的公民的安全威胁。”

<div class="left">
<p>Listening to his talk was a Brooklyn schoolteacher, William Frauenglass, who had a month earlier been called to testify in Washington before a Senate Internal Security Subcommittee looking into communist influence in high schools. He had refused to talk, and now he wanted Einstein to say whether he had been right.</p>

一位名叫理查德·弗劳恩格拉斯的布鲁克林的中学教师收听了他的讲话。一个月前，他曾被调查共产主义在中学影响的参议院内部安全小组委员会传唤到华盛顿作证，他拒绝发表意见。现在他想问爱因斯坦他这样做是否正确。



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein crafted a reply and told Frauenglass he could make it public. “The reactionary politicians have managed to instill suspicions of all intellectual efforts,” he wrote. “They are now proceeding to suppress the freedom of teaching.” What should intellectuals do against this evil? “Frankly, I can only see the revolutionary way of non-cooperation in the sense of Gandhi’s,” Einstein declared. “Every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to refuse to testify.”<sup><a id="filepos1465291"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1966118">13</a></sup></p>

<p>
爱因斯坦回了信，并告诉弗劳恩格拉斯可以公开这封信。“反动政客在设法向公众灌输一种思想，让他们怀疑一切理智的努力，”他写道，“现在，他们又来压制教学自由。”知识分子应当如何来反抗这种罪恶？“坦率地讲，我看只有采用甘地所主张的那种不合作的革命方法，”爱因斯坦说，“每一位受到委员会传讯的知识分子都应当拒绝作证。”

<p>Einstein’s lifelong comfort in resisting prevailing winds made him serenely stubborn during the McCarthy era.

爱因斯坦一直拒绝流行时尚，这不仅使他终生受益，也使他在麦卡锡时代固执己见。在那个时代，人们常常被要求说出别人的名字，并在对他们及其同事的忠诚调查中作证，爱因斯坦的做法却很简单：不要合作。

<p>He felt, as he told Frauenglass, that this should be done based on <a id="filepos1465812"></a>the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment, rather than the “subterfuge” of invoking the Fifth Amendment’s protection against possible self-incrimination. Standing up for the First Amendment was particularly a duty of intellectuals, he said, because they had a special role in society as preservers of free thought. He was still horrified that most intellectuals in Germany had not risen in resistance when the Nazis came to power.</p>

正如他对弗劳恩格拉斯所说，他认为这应当以第一修正案所保证的言论自由为根据，而不是援引防止自己受到牵连的第五修正案作为“托词”。他说，维护第一修正案尤其是知识分子的义务，因为他们在社会中扮演着维护自由思想的特殊角色。纳粹上台时，德国大多数知识分子都没有站出来声讨，这仍然使他感到惊骇。

Senator McCarthy wanted to show that the union had ties to Moscow and had endangered the defense industry. Shadowitz, who had been a member of the Communist Party, decided to invoke the protections of the First, not the Fifth, Amendment, as Einstein had recommended to Frauenglass.<sup><a id="filepos1472355"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1967722">20</a></sup></p>

<p>Another case hit closer to home: that of J. Robert Oppenheimer. After leading the scientists who developed the atom bomb and then becoming head of the Institute where Einstein still puttered in to work, Oppenheimer remained an adviser to the Atomic Energy Commission and kept his security clearance. By initially opposing the development of the hydrogen bomb, he had turned Edward Teller into an adversary, and he also alienated AEC commissioner Lewis Strauss. Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, and his brother, Frank, had been members of the Communist Party before the war, and Oppenheimer himself had associated freely with party members and with scientists whose loyalty came under question.<sup><a id="filepos1476001"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1968745">23</a></sup></p>

At the end of the Oppenheimer investigation, both he and Einstein were still harbored safely in their haven in Princeton, free to think and speak as they chose.
