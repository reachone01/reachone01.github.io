In the article he wrote for <em>The Times</em> of London after the confirmation of his relativity theory, Einstein quipped that if things went bad the Germans would no longer consider him a compatriot but instead a Swiss Jew. It was a clever remark, made more so because Einstein knew, even then, that there was an odious smell of truth to it. That very week, in a letter to his friend Paul Ehrenfest, he described the mood in Germany. “Anti-Semitism is very strong here,” he wrote. “Where is this all supposed to lead?”<sup><a id="filepos804090"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1785776">1</a></sup>

在相对论得到证实之后，爱因斯坦为伦敦的《泰晤士报》写了一篇文章。他在文中调侃道，要是相对论搞砸了，德国人肯定会把他当成瑞士的犹太人，而不再认为是自己的同胞。这种说法很有点先知先觉的味道。那时爱因斯坦已经感觉到了这种令人不快的气氛。在同一周写给好友埃伦菲斯特的信中，他描述了德国当时的情况。“这里的排犹情绪非常浓厚，”他写道，“下一步会如何发展呢？”

The rise of German anti-Semitism after World War I produced a counterreaction in Einstein: it made him identify more strongly with his Jewish heritage and community. At one extreme were German Jews such as Fritz Haber, who did everything they could, including <a id="filepos804448"></a>converting to Christianity, to assimilate, and they urged Einstein to do the same. But Einstein took the opposite approach. Just when he was becoming famous, he embraced the Zionist cause. He did not officially join any Zionist organization, nor for that matter did he belong to or worship at any synagogue. But he cast his lot in favor of Jewish settlements in Palestine, a national identity among Jews everywhere, and the rejection of assimilationist desires.

第一次世界大战以后，德国反犹主义开始抬头，这使得爱因斯坦更加强烈地意识到了自己的犹太血统和归属。在当时，像哈伯这样的德国犹太人是一个极端，他们竭尽全力使自己同化，甚至阪依基督教，还劝说爱因斯坦也这样做。但爱因斯坦的做法完全相反，他刚一成名便投身于犹太复国主义运动。虽然他从未正式加入过任何犹太复国主义组织，也没有因此而隶属于任何犹太教会，或在犹太会堂做礼拜，但他赞成在巴勒斯坦修建犹太人定居点，为全体犹太人的民族认同而奔走，为抵制同化主义的影响而奔走。

He was recruited by the pioneering Zionist leader Kurt Blumenfeld, who paid a call on Einstein in Berlin in early 1919. “With extreme naïveté he asked questions,” Blumenfeld recalled. Among Einstein’s queries: With their spiritual and intellectual gifts, why should Jews be called on to create an agricultural nation-state? Wasn’t nationalism the problem rather than the solution?
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


1919年年初，犹太复国主义运动的领导人库尔特·布卢门菲尔德在柏林拜访了爱因斯坦，请求他的帮助。“他带着天真的神情向我发问。”布卢门菲尔德回忆说。爱因斯坦的疑问包括：以犹太人在精神和智力上的禀赋，为什么要去建立一个单一民族的独立国家？民族主义难道不恰恰是问题，而不是问题的解决吗？


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Eventually, Einstein came around to the cause. “I am, as a human being, an opponent of nationalism,” he declared. “But as a Jew, I am from today a supporter of the Zionist effort.”<sup><a id="filepos805653"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1785940">2</a></sup> He also became, more specifically, an advocate for the creation of a new Jewish university in Palestine, which eventually became Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦最终还是被说服了。“从做人的态度上讲，我反对民族主义，”他宣称，“但作为犹太人，我从今天开始支持犹太复国主义者的努力。” 他还提议在巴勒斯坦新建一所犹太人的大学，这就是后来耶路撒冷的希伯来大学。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Once he decided to abandon the postulate that all forms of nationalism were bad, he found it easy to embrace Zionism with greater enthusiasm. “One can be an internationalist without being indifferent to members of one’s tribe,” he wrote a friend in October 1919. “The Zionist cause is very close to my heart ...I am glad that there should be a little patch of earth on which our kindred brethren are not considered aliens.”<sup><a id="filepos806370"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786229">3</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


既然不再坚持一切形式的民族主义都是坏的，他自然会更加热情地拥护犹太复国主义。“一个人可以既是国际主义者，同时又关心其部族成员，”他1919年10月给一位朋友写信说，“犹太复国主义事业于我心有戚戚……我很高兴地球上能有一小块土地，在那里我们的同胞兄弟不再被视作异己。”

His support for Zionism put Einstein at odds with assimilationists. In April 1920, he was invited to address a meeting of one such group that emphasized its members’ loyalty to Germany, the German Citizens of the Jewish Faith. He replied by accusing them of trying to separate themselves from the poorer and less polished eastern European Jews. “Can the ‘Aryan’ respect such pussyfooters?” he chided.<sup><a id="filepos806903"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786388">4</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

由于支持犹太复国主义，爱因斯坦与民族同化论者产生了不和。1920年4月，一个强调效忠于德国的组织“犹太教德国公民中央协会”邀请他在会议上发表讲演。爱因斯坦指责他们企图脱离那些更为穷苦和寒酸的东欧犹太人。“‘雅利安人’可能尊重这种持骑墙态度的人吗？”他斥责道。 

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

Privately declining the invitation was not enough. Einstein also felt compelled to write a public attack on those who tried to fit in by talking <a id="filepos807146"></a>“about religious faith instead of tribal affiliation.”<a id="filepos807219"></a><a href="Einstein_split_062.html#filepos2416414">*</a> In particular, he scorned what he called “the assimilatory” approach that sought “to overcome anti-Semitism by dropping nearly everything Jewish.” This never worked; indeed, it “appears somewhat comical to a non-Jew,” because the Jews are a people set apart from others. “The psychological root of anti-Semitism lies in the fact that the Jews are a group of people unto themselves,” he wrote. “Their Jewishness is visible in their physical appearance, and one notices their Jewish heritage in their intellectual work.”<sup><a id="filepos807838"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786582">5</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

仅有私下里的拒绝还不够，爱因斯坦感到有必要再写一篇文章，公开抨击那些只谈“宗教信仰，不谈部族联系” 以求顺应的人。他特别嘲笑了那种企图“通过几乎放弃犹太人的一切来克服反犹主义”的“同化”方法。这种做法不仅从未取得过成效，而且“在非犹太人看来也显得可笑”，因为犹太人是一个与众不同的民族。“反犹主义的心理根源在于犹太人自成一体这样一个事实，”他写道，“其犹太特性显示在他们的身体外貌上，人们在其思想成果中看到了他们的犹太遗产。”

The Jews who practiced and preached assimilation tended to be those who took pride in their German or western European heritage. At the time (and through much of the twentieth century), they tended to look down on Jews from eastern Europe, such as Russia and Poland, who seemed less polished, refined, and assimilated. Although Einstein was German Jewish, he was appalled by those from his background who would “draw a sharp dividing line between eastern European Jews and western European Jews.” The approach was doomed to backfire against all Jews, he argued, and it was not based on any true distinction. “Eastern European Jewry contains a rich potential of human talents and productive forces that can well stand the comparison to the higher civilization of western European Jews.”<sup><a id="filepos808750"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786799">6</a></sup>

<p>
那些实行和鼓吹同化的犹太人往往会扬扬自得于他们的德国或西欧血统。当时（以及20世纪的大部分时间），他们不太瞧得起来自俄国和波兰等国的东欧犹太人，因为这些人看上去不够文雅和有教养，同化程度也不深。尽管爱因斯坦是德国犹太人，但他仍然惊诧于这些与他出身相同的人竟然会“在西欧犹太人与东欧犹太人之间划分明确的界限”。他认为，这种做法注定会对所有犹太人产生不利影响，因为它所基于的区分并不真实。“东欧犹太人中间潜藏的巨大才能和生产力，足以与西欧犹太人的较高文明相媲美。”

Einstein was acutely aware, even more than the assimilationists, that anti-Semitism was not the result of rational causes. “In Germany today hatred of the Jews has taken on horrible expressions,” he wrote in early 1920. Part of the problem was that inflation was out of control. The German mark had been worth about 12 cents at the beginning of 1919, which was half of its value from before the war but still manageable. But by the beginning of 1920, the mark was worth a mere 2 cents, and collapsing further each month.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦甚至比同化论者更为敏锐地认识到，反犹主义并非源于理性。“在今天的德国，对犹太人的仇恨已经表现得有些骇人。”他在1920年年初写道。问题部分出在通货膨胀正在失去控制。德国马克在1919年年初的价值为12美分，这虽然只抵得上战前价值的一半，但尚在可控范围之内。而到了1920年年初，1马克仅值2美分，而且还在逐月贬值。

In addition, the loss of the war had been humiliating. Germany had lost 6 million men and then was forced into surrendering land containing half of its natural resources, plus all of its overseas colonies. Many proud Germans believed it must have been the result of betrayal. The Weimar Republic that had emerged after the war, though supported by liberals and pacifists and Jews such as Einstein, was disdained by much of the old order and even the middle class.

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
不仅如此，战争的失败一直让人觉得脸上无光。德国损失了600万人，换来的却是割让占一半自然资源的土地以及所有海外殖民地。许多自命不凡的德国人相信，这一定是因为有人出卖。战后成立的魏玛共和国虽然得到了自由主义者、和平主义者以及像爱因斯坦这样的犹太人的支持，却遭到了大多数旧势力甚至是中产阶级的鄙视。

<a id="filepos809957"></a>There was one group that could be easily cast as the alien and dark force most responsible for the humiliation facing a proud culture.“People need a scapegoat and make the Jews responsible,” Einstein noted. “They are a target of instinctive resentment because they are of a different tribe.”<sup><a id="filepos810284"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787129">7</a></sup>

有一个群体最容易为人所不容。他们被视为一股恶势力，最应该对这种高傲的文化所面临的屈辱负责。“人们需要一只替罪羊，于是便归咎于犹太人，”爱因斯坦指出，“他们是本能怨恨的发泄目标，因为他们是一个与众不同的部族。”

The explosion of great art and ideas in Germany at the time, as Amos Elon wrote in his book <em>The Pity of It All,</em> was largely due to Jewish patrons and pioneers in a variety of fields. This was particularly true in science. As Sigmund Freud pointed out, part of the success of Jewish scientists was their “creative skepticism,” which arose from their essential nature as outsiders.<sup><a id="filepos810934"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787446">8</a></sup> What the Jewish assimilationists underestimated was the virulence with which many Germans, whom they considered to be their fellow countrymen, in fact saw them as essentially outsiders or, as Einstein put it, “a different tribe.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


正如阿莫斯·埃隆在其《一切之憾》（The Pity It All）中所指出的，当时德国艺术和思想的繁荣在很大程度上应归功于各个领域的犹太资助者和先驱者。在科学领域尤其如此。弗洛伊德指出，犹太科学家所取得的成功部分在于他们“创造性的怀疑论”，这源自于他们的局外人本性。 那些犹太同化论者没有看到，许多被他们当作同胞的德国人其实视他们为异类，或如爱因斯坦所说，把他们看成“一个不同的部族”。

Einstein’s first public collision with this anti-Semitism came in the summer of 1920. A shady German nationalist named Paul Weyland, an engineer by training, had turned himself into a polemicist with political aspirations. He was an active member of a right-wing nationalistic political party that pledged, in its 1920 official program, to “diminish the dominant Jewish influence showing up increasingly in government and in public.”<sup><a id="filepos811730"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787576">9</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

1920年夏，爱因斯坦第一次与这种反犹主义公开发生冲突。正在接受培训的工程师、臭名昭著的德国民族主义者保罗·魏兰德，成了一个有政治野心的辩论家。他是一个右翼民族主义政党的激进分子，该党在1920年的正式纲领中誓言“削弱犹太人在政府和公众中日益显著的影响”。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Weyland realized that Einstein, as a highly publicized Jew, had engendered resentment and jealousy. Likewise, his relativity theory was easy to turn into a target, because many people, including some scientists, were unnerved by the way it seemed to undermine absolutes and be built on abstract hypotheses rather than grounded in solid experiment. So Weyland published articles denouncing relativity as “a big hoax” and formed a ragtag (but mysteriously well-funded) organization <a id="filepos812320"></a>grandly dubbed the Study Group of German Scientists for the Preservation of a Pure Science.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

魏兰德意识到，爱因斯坦作为一个知名度极高的犹太人，已经招致了怨恨和嫉妒。他的相对论也很容易成为众矢之的，包括一些科学家在内的许多人都不满于它，因为它似乎颠覆了绝对性，而且建立在抽象的假说而非牢靠的实验基础上。魏兰德发表文章谴责相对论是“一场大骗局”，还成立了一个由乌合之众组成的团体（然而资金却很充足，并给它起了一个冠冕堂皇的名字——“德国科学家维护科学纯洁研究小组”。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Joining with Weyland was an experimental physicist of modest reputation named Ernst Gehrcke, who for years had been assailing relativity with more vehemence than comprehension. Their group lobbed a few personal attacks at Einstein and the “Jewish nature” of relativity theory, then called a series of meetings around Germany, including a large rally at Berlin’s Philharmonic Hall on August 24.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

加入魏兰德队伍的还有一位名头不大的实验物理学家恩斯特·格尔克。多年来，他一直在猛烈攻击相对论，不过更多是出于恶意，而不是为了真理。他们的小组对爱因斯坦和相对论的“犹太性”屡次进行人身攻击，还在全德国组织了一系列会议，包括8月24日在柏林爱乐音乐厅举行的一次大型集会。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Weyland spoke first and, with the orotund rhetoric of a demagogue, accused Einstein of engaging in a “businesslike booming of his theory and his name.” Einstein’s penchant for publicity, wanted or not, was being used against him, as his assimilationist friends had warned. Relativity was a hoax, Weyland said, and plagiarized to boot. Gehrcke said much the same with a more technical gloss, reading from a written text. The meeting, reported the <em>New York Times,</em> “had a decidedly antiSemitic complexion.”<sup><a id="filepos813490"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787795">10</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

魏兰德第一个发言。他以一个蛊惑民心的政客所特有的腔调，指责爱因斯坦“对其理论和名声大肆吹噓”。正如爱因斯坦的同化论者朋友所警告的，无论如何，爱因斯坦对哗众取宠的嗜好正在给他惹来麻烦。魏兰德说，相对论是一场骗局，是靠剽窃发家的。格尔克也照本宣科讲了类似的话，只不过多了几分技术性。《纽约时报》报道说，这次会议“带有明显的反犹主义色彩”。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

In the middle of Gehrcke’s talk, there arose from the audience a quiet murmur:<em>Einstein, Einstein.</em> He had come to see the circus and, averse neither to publicity nor controversy, laugh at the spectacle. As his friend Philipp Frank noted, “He always liked to regard events in the world around him as if he were a spectator in a theater.” Sitting in the audience with his friend the chemist Walther Nernst, he cackled loudly at times and at the end pronounced the entire event “most amusing.”<sup><a id="filepos814122"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787956">11</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在格尔克讲话时，听众席中传来一阵骚动：“爱因斯坦，爱因斯坦。”他也赶来观看了表演，并且无所顾忌地嘲笑这场闹剧。正如好友弗兰克所指出的：“他总喜欢关注周围世界发生的事情，宛如剧场里的一名观众。”他和化学家朋友能斯特坐在听众席中，不时发出爽朗的笑声，称整场表演“有趣极了”。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

But he was not truly amused, and he even briefly considered moving away from Berlin.<sup><a id="filepos814310"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788141">12</a></sup> His anger aroused, he made the tactical mistake of responding with a highly charged diatribe that was published three days later on the front page of the <em>Berliner Tageblatt,</em> a liberal daily owned by Jewish friends. “I am well aware that the two speakers are unworthy of reply by my pen,” he said, but then proceeded not to be restrained by that awareness. Gehrcke and Weyland had not been explicitly anti-Semitic, nor did they overtly criticize Jews in their speeches. But Einstein alleged that they would not have attacked his theory “if I were a German nationalist, with or without a swastika, instead of a Jew.”<sup><a id="filepos815005"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788562">13</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

当然，他并不是真的觉得有趣，甚至还一度考虑搬离柏林。 三天后，义愤填膺的爱因斯坦即以《柏林日报》（这是犹太人朋友办的一份自由派报纸）头版的一篇言辞激烈的骂文作为回应，这着实是一种战术性错误。“我非常清楚地知道，这两位演讲者都不值得我动笔去回应。，他说。但接下来，他并没有将这种认识真正贯彻下去。格尔克和魏兰德并未在演说中公开反犹，也没有公然批判犹太人，但爱因斯坦声称，“假如我是德国的民族主义者（无论是否戴‘卐’字徽），而不是犹太人”，他们就不会攻击他的理论。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein spent most of his piece refuting Weyland and Gehrcke. <a id="filepos815167"></a>But he also attacked a more reputable physicist who was not at the meeting but had given support to the antirelativity cause: Philipp Lenard.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦的文章主要驳斥了魏兰德和格尔克，但同时也攻击了一个更著名的物理学家。后者当时并不在场，但支持过反相对论运动。他就是勒纳德。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize, Lenard had been a pioneer experimenter who described the photoelectric effect. Einstein had once admired him. “I have just read a wonderful paper by Lenard,” Einstein had gushed to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> back in 1901. “Under this beautiful piece I am filled with such happiness and joy that I absolutely must share some of it with you.” After Einstein had published his first spate of seminal papers in 1905, citing Lenard by name in the one on light quanta, the two scientists had exchanged flattering letters.<sup><a id="filepos815966"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788746">14</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
勒纳德曾是光电效应领域具有开创性的实验物理学家，获得过1905年的诺贝尔奖。爱因斯坦一度仰慕过他。“我刚刚读了勒纳德写的一篇出色论文”爱因斯坦1901年给米列娃写信说，“读罢这篇美文，我心中充满了幸福和喜悦，一定要和你分享其中的快乐。”爱因斯坦1905年发表第一批重要论文之后，两人曾经写过一些惺惺相惜的信，那篇光量子论文还提到了勒纳德的名字。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

But as an ardent German nationalist, Lenard had become increasingly bitter about the British and the Jews, contemptuous of the publicity Einstein’s theory was garnering, and vocal in his attacks on the “absurd” aspects of relativity. He had allowed his name to be used on brochures that were distributed at Weyland’s meeting, and as a Nobel laureate he had worked behind the scenes to make sure that Einstein was not awarded the prize.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


但是作为一名狂热的德国民族主义者，勒纳德变得越来越仇恨英国人和犹太人。他鄙视爱因斯坦的理论所获得的知名度，攻击相对论的“荒谬”之处。魏兰德会议上散发的小册子上俨然就印有他的名字。作为诺贝尔奖获得者，他曾经在幕后活动，试图阻止爱因斯坦得奖。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Because Lenard had refrained from showing up at the Philharmonic Hall rally, and because his published critiques of relativity had been academic in tone, Einstein did not need to attack him in his newspaper piece. But he did. “I admire Lenard as a master of experimental physics, but he has not yet produced anything outstanding in theoretical physics, and his objections to the general theory of relativity are of such superficiality that, up until now, I did not think it necessary to answer them,” he wrote. “I intend to make up for this.”<sup><a id="filepos817152"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788928">15</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

由于勒纳德没有在柏林爱乐音乐厅的集会上露面，而且他对相对论发表的批评是学术腔调，爱因斯坦本来不需要在报纸上攻击他。但他还是这样做了。“我钦佩作为实验物理学大师的勒纳德，但他在理论物理学中并没有做出什么出色的成就，对广义相对论的反驳也是非常肤浅的，到目前为止我认为没有必要做出回应，”他写道，“现在我想弥补一下。”

Einstein’s friends publicly supported him.

Privately, however, his friends were appalled. He had been provoked into a display of public anger against those who should have remained unworthy of a reply by his pen, thus stirring up even more distasteful publicity. Max Born’s wife, Hedwig, who had freely scolded Einstein about his treatment of his family, now lectured, “[You should] not have allowed yourself to be goaded into that rather unfortunate <a id="filepos818064"></a>reply.” He should show more respect, she said, for “the secluded temple of science.”<sup><a id="filepos818178"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789251">17</a></sup>

然而在私下里，朋友们都吓坏了。爱因斯坦已经被触怒，对那些本不值得亲自回应的人公开表达愤慨，从而招致了更多令人不快的名声。曾经公开指责他对家庭处理不善的玻恩的妻子海德维希，现在说他“不应按捺不住情绪，做出这一相当不幸的回应”，并认为他应当对“寂寥的科学殿堂”显示出更多的尊敬。

Paul Ehrenfest was even harsher. “My wife and I absolutely cannot believe that you yourself wrote some of the phrases in the article,” he said. “If you really did write them down with your own hand, it proves that these damn pigs have finally succeeded in touching your soul.

埃伦菲斯特说得更加严厉。“我妻子和我绝对无法相信你在文章中写了这样一些话，”他说，“如果它们果真是你本人所写，这证明这些该死的猪猡终于成功地扰乱了你的灵魂。我非常强烈地敦促你不要再就此话题向公众这头贪婪的野兽多说一个字。”

Einstein was somewhat contrite. “Don’t be too severe with me,” he replied to the Borns. “Everyone must, from time to time, make a sacrifice on the altar of stupidity, to please the deity and mankind. And I did so thoroughly with my article.”<sup><a id="filepos819069"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789574">19</a></sup> But he made no apologies for flunking their standards of publicity avoidance. “I had to do this if I wanted to stay in Berlin, where every child recognizes me from photographs,” he told Ehrenfest. “If one believes in democracy, then one must grant the public this much right as well.”<sup><a id="filepos819425"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789742">20</a></sup>

Not surprisingly, Lenard was outraged by Einstein’s article. He insisted on an apology, as he had not even been part of the antirelativity rally.

(There was one odd coda to this event. In 1953, according to declassified documents in Einstein’s FBI file, a well-dressed German walked into the FBI field office in Miami and told the receptionist he had information that Einstein had admitted to being a communist in an article in <em>Berliner Tageblatt</em> in August 1920. The aspiring informer was none other than Paul Weyland, who had landed in Miami and was trying to emigrate after years of being a con man and swindler all over the world. J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI was eagerly trying to prove, with no success, that Einstein was a communist, and took up the cause. After three months, the Bureau finally found the article and translated it. There was nothing about being a communist in it. Weyland was, nevertheless, granted American citizenship.)<sup><a id="filepos820893"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790079">22</a></sup>

（这件事有一个奇特的结局。根据美国联邦调查局爱因斯坦档案中解密文件的说法，1953年，一个穿着考究的德国人走进了迈阿密的联邦调查局办公室，声称有消息指出，爱因斯坦曾经在1920年8月《柏林日报》的一篇文章中承认过自己是共产主义者。这位热心的通报者不是别人，正是魏兰德。在全世界行骗多年之后，他到了迈阿密，正试图移民美国。J.埃德加·胡佛的美国联邦调查局正苦于无法证明爱因斯坦是共产主义者，便开始着手调查。三个月后，联邦调查局终于找到了那篇文章并做了翻译，但其中并无任何关于爱因斯坦是共产主义者的内容。不过，魏兰德还是得到了美国国籍。）

The public crossfire coming out of the antirelativity rally heightened <a id="filepos821063"></a>interest in the upcoming annual meeting of German scientists, scheduled for late September in the spa town of Bad Nauheim. Both Einstein and Lenard were to attend, and Einstein had ended his newspaper response by proclaiming that, at his suggestion, a public discussion of relativity would occur there. “Anyone who can dare face a scientific forum can present his objections there,” he said, tossing a gauntlet in Lenard’s direction.

因反相对论集会而引发的公开交火激起了人们对9月底将在温泉小城巴特瑙海姆（Bad Nauheim）召开的德国科学家年会的兴趣。爱因斯坦和勒纳德都会参加这次会议。爱因斯坦还在那篇报纸文章的结尾宣布，根据他的建议，届时将举行一场关于相对论的公开辩论。“任何敢于直面科学讨论的人都可以在那里提出他的反驳”，这话显然直指勒纳德。

During the weeklong gathering in Bad Nauheim, Einstein stayed with Max Born in Frankfurt, twenty miles away, and the two men commuted to the resort town by train each day. The big showdown over relativity, at which both Einstein and Lenard were expected to participate, was on the afternoon of September 23. Einstein had forgotten to bring anything to write with, so he borrowed the pencil of the person next to him in order to take notes while Lenard talked.

在巴特瑙海姆为期一周的会议中，爱因斯坦和玻恩待在20英里以外的法兰克福，两人每天乘火车前往这座疗养胜地城市。9月23日下午，期盼已久的爱因斯坦与勒纳德的决战终于打响。爱因斯坦忘了带笔，于是向邻座借了一支铅笔，边听勒纳德说话边做笔记。

Planck was in the chair, and by both his commanding presence and soothing words he was able to prevent any personal attacks. Lenard’s objections to relativity were similar to those of many nontheorists. The theory was built on equations rather than observations, he said, and it “offends against the simple common sense of a scientist.” Einstein replied that what “seems obvious” changes over time. That was true even of Galileo’s mechanics.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


会议由普朗克主持，他的威仪和抚慰人心的话语使得会上没有出现任何人身攻击。勒纳德对相对论的反驳与许多非理论家如出一辙。他说，相对论的基础是方程而不是观察，它“违反了一个科学家单纯的良知”。爱因斯坦回复说，什么东西“看起来显然”因时代而变，即使伽利略的力学也不例外。

It was the first time that Einstein and Lenard had met, but they did not shake hands or speak to each other. And though the official minutes of the meeting do not record it, Einstein apparently lost his equanimity at one point. “Einstein was provoked into making a caustic reply,” Born recalled. And a few weeks later, Einstein wrote Born to assure him that he would “not allow myself to get excited again as in Nauheim.”<sup><a id="filepos823078"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790237">23</a></sup>

<p>

这是爱因斯坦与勒纳德的首次会面，但他们没有握手，也没有交谈。尽管官方的会议记录里没有记载，但爱因斯坦显然一度失去了镇定。“爱因斯坦忍不住做了刻薄的回应。”玻恩回忆说。几周以后，爱因斯坦给玻恩写信保证，他以后不会“再像在巴特瑙海姆那样激动了”。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Finally, Planck was able to end the session, before any blood was drawn, with a limp joke. “Since the theory of relativity unfortunately has not so far been able to extend the absolute time available for this meeting,” he said, “ it must now be adjourned.”The papers the next day were left without headlines, and the antirelativity movement subsided for the time being.<sup><a id="filepos823575"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790409">24</a></sup>

</div>

<p>

最后，普朗克以一个勉强的玩笑结束了会议，以免酿成更大的冲突。“非常遗憾，鉴于到目前为止相对论没有办法延长本次会议所需的绝对时间，”他说，“现在必须暂时休会了。”第二天报纸上没有什么特别报道，反相对论运动暂时平息下去了。 


</p>

As for Lenard, he distanced himself from the weird group of original antirelativists. “Unfortunately Weyland turned out to be a crook,” <a id="filepos823822"></a>he later said. But he did not let go of his own antipathy toward Einstein. After the Bad Nauheim meeting he became increasingly vitriolic and anti-Semitic in his attacks on Einstein and “Jewish science.” He became a proponent of creating a “Deutsche Physik” that purged German physics of Jewish influences, which to him was exemplified by Einstein’s relativity theory with its abstract, theoretical, and nonexperimental approach and its odor (at least to him) of a relativism that rejected absolutes, order, and certainties.

至于勒纳德，则疏远了原先那个怪异的反相对论组织。“不幸的是，魏兰德原来是个骗子”，他后来说。但他对爱因斯坦的憎恶并没有减少。在巴特瑙海姆的会议之后，他愈发激烈地攻击爱因斯坦和“犹太科学”。他鼓吹创建一种“德意志物理学”，将德国物理学中的犹太流毒肃清。在他看来，首当其冲的就是爱因斯坦的相对论及其理论的、非实验的抽象方法，以及它拒斥绝对、秩序和必然性的（至少在他看来的）相对主义味道。

A few months later, at the beginning of January 1921, an obscure Munich party functionary picked up the theme. “Science, once our greatest pride, is today being taught by Hebrews,” Adolf Hitler wrote in a newspaper polemic.<sup><a id="filepos824680"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790582">25</a></sup> There were even ripples that made it across the Atlantic.

Albert Einstein’s exploding global fame and budding Zionism came together in the spring of 1921 for an event that was unique in the history of science, and indeed remarkable for any realm: a grand two-month processional through the eastern and midwestern United States that evoked the sort of mass frenzy and press adulation that would thrill a touring rock star. The world had never before seen, and perhaps never will again, such a scientific celebrity superstar, one who also happened to be a gentle icon of humanist values and a living patron saint for Jews.

1921年春，爱因斯坦的盛名和萌发的犹太复国主义因一件特殊的事情而融合到了一起。这件事情不仅在科学史上独一无二，而且在任何方面都很引人注目，那就是一连两个月在美国东部和中西部巡游，激起了大众和媒体的狂热追捧，那种场面连巡演的摇滚明星都会为之震撼。历史上从未出现过（也许今后也不会再出现）这样一个超级科学巨星，同时也是一个温文尔雅的人道主义偶像和犹太人的在世守护神。

Einstein had initially thought that his first visit to America might be a way to make some money in a stable currency in order to provide for his family in Switzerland. “I have demanded $15,000 from Princeton and Wisconsin,” he told Ehrenfest.“It will probably scare them off. But if they do bite, I will be buying economic independence for myself—and that’s not a thing to sniff at.”

一开始，爱因斯坦是想通过初访美国挣到一些价值坚挺的货币，以补贴瑞士家用。“我向普林斯顿（大学）和威斯康星（大学）索取了15000美元，”他告诉埃伦菲斯特，“这也许会让他们打退堂鼓。但如果他们真的上钩，我会换来经济上的独立一这倒不是什么让人嗤之以鼻的事情。”

The American universities did not bite. “My demands were too high,” he reported back to Ehrenfest.<sup><a id="filepos826462"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791179">27</a></sup> So by February 1921, he had <a id="filepos826533"></a>made other plans for the spring: he would present a paper at the third Solvay Conference in Brussels and give some lectures in Leiden at the behest of Ehrenfest.

美国大学并没有上钩。“我要价太高了”，他反馈给埃伦菲斯特。 于是到了1921年2月，他制订了另一种春季计划：他将在布鲁塞尔举行的第三届索尔维会议上提交一篇论文，并应埃伦菲斯特之邀在莱顿做若干场讲演。

It was then that Kurt Blumenfeld, leader of the Zionist movement in Germany, came by Einstein’s apartment once again. Exactly two years earlier, Blumenfeld had visited Einstein and enlisted his support for the cause of creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Now he was coming with an invitation—or perhaps an instruction—in the form of a telegram from the president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann.

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
就在这时，德国犹太复国主义运动的领导人布卢门菲尔德又一次登门拜访了爱因斯坦。两年前，布卢门菲尔德曾经拜访过爱因斯坦一次，希望他支持在巴勒斯坦建立犹太国。这一次他带来了世界犹太复国主义组织主席哈伊姆·魏茨曼发来的一份电报邀请（或许也是一份指令）。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Weizmann was a brilliant biochemist who had emigrated from Russia to England, where he helped his adopted nation in the First World War by coming up with a bacterial method for more efficiently manufacturing the explosive cordite. During that war he worked under former prime minister Arthur Balfour, who was then first lord of the Admiralty. He subsequently helped to persuade Balfour, after he became foreign secretary, to issue the famous 1917 declaration in which Britain pledged to support “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

魏茨曼是一个杰出的生物化学家，曾经从俄国移民到英国。第一次世界大战期间，他发明了一种可以更有效地制造炸药的细菌方法，从而帮助了英国。那时他在时任海军部首任司令的前首相阿瑟·詹姆斯·贝尔福手下工作。后来贝尔福当上了外交大臣，他帮助说服贝尔福签署了著名的1917年宣言，在这份宣言中，英国誓言支持“犹太人在巴勒斯坦建立民族家园”。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Weizmann’s telegram invited Einstein to accompany him on a trip to America to raise funds to help settle Palestine and, in particular, to create Hebrew University in Jerusalem. When Blumenfeld read it to him, Einstein initially balked. He was not an orator, he said, and the role of simply using his celebrity to draw crowds to the cause was “an unworthy one.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


魏茨曼在电报中邀请爱因斯坦一起到美国为在巴勒斯坦建立犹太人定居点，特别是在耶路撒冷建立希伯来大学筹款。布卢门菲尔德读完电报后，爱因斯坦先是拒绝。他说他不是一个演说家，借他的名气使人投身这一事业是“不足取的”。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Blumenfeld did not argue. Instead, he simply read Weizmann’s telegram aloud again. “He is the president of our organization,” Blumenfeld said, “and if you take your conversion to Zionism seriously, then I have the right to ask you, in Dr. Weizmann’s name, to go with him to the United States.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

布卢门菲尔德没有争辩，他只是重新朗读了一遍魏茨曼的电报。“他是我们组织的主席，”布卢门菲尔德说，“如果您认真看待您对犹太复国主义态度的转变，我就有权以魏茨曼博士的名义请您跟他一道到美国。”

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

“What you say is right and convincing,” Einstein replied, to the “boundless astonishment” of Blumenfeld. “I realize that I myself am now part of the situation and that I must accept the invitation.”<sup><a id="filepos828949"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791560">28</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


“您说得很对，很有说服力，”爱因斯坦的回答令布卢门菲尔德“无限惊异”，“我明白，遇到这种情况，我只有接受这个邀请。” 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein’s reply was indeed a cause for astonishment. He was already committed to the Solvay Conference and other lectures in Europe, he <a id="filepos829191"></a>professed to dislike the public spotlight, and his fragile stomach had made him reluctant to travel. He was not a faithful Jew, and his allergy to nationalism kept him from being a pure and unalloyed Zionist.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦的回答的确让人惊讶。他本来已经答应要去参加索尔维会议，并且在欧洲做演讲。他表示自己不喜欢被公众注意，而且那个脆弱的胃也已使他不愿再做旅行。再者，他不是一个虔诚的犹太人，对民族主义的反感使他不能成为一个纯粹的犹太复国主义者。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

Yet now he was doing something that went against his nature: accepting an implied command from a figure of authority, one that was based on his perceived bonds and commitments to other people. Why?
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

但是现在，他的做法却违反了他的本性：基于所感受到的与他人的纽带和承诺，接受一个权威人物的含蓄命令。为什么？

Einstein’s decision reflected a major transformation in his life. Until the completion and confirmation of his general theory of relativity, he had dedicated himself almost totally to science, to the exclusion even of his personal, familial, and societal relationships. But his time in Berlin had made him increasingly aware of his identity as a Jew. His reaction to the pervasive anti-Semitism was to feel even more connected—indeed, inextricably connected—to the culture and community of his people.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦的决定表明，他的生活发生了重大转变。在广义相对论完成和得到证实之前，他几乎全身心地投身于科学，甚至连他的个人、家庭和社会关系都不予考虑。但在柏林，他越来越认识到自己的犹太人身份。盛行的反犹主义使他感到，他与犹太民族的文化和共同体有着更深的甚至是密不可分的联系。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Thus in 1921, he made a leap not of faith but of commitment. “I am really doing whatever I can for the brothers of my race who are treated so badly everywhere,” he wrote Maurice Solovine.<sup><a id="filepos830497"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791702">29</a></sup> Next to his science, this would become his most important defining connection. As he would note near the end of his life, after declining the presidency of Israel, “My relationship to the Jewish people has become my strongest human tie.”<sup><a id="filepos830794"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791877">30</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

于是在1921年，他不是改变了信仰，而是改变了承诺。“实际上，我正在尽我一切所能为我的同胞兄弟服务，他们在各地的处境太糟糕了。”他给索洛文写信说。 除科学以外，这将成为他最重要的有决定性意义的事业。正如他在晚年拒绝担任以色列总统以后所指出的：“我与犹太民族的关系已经成为我最牢固的人性纽带。” 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

One person who was not only astonished but dismayed by Einstein’s decision was his friend and colleague in Berlin, the chemist Fritz Haber, who had converted from Judaism and assiduously assimilated in order to appear a proper Prussian. Like other assimilationists, he was worried (understandably) that a visit by Einstein to the great wartime enemy at the behest of a Zionist organization would reinforce the belief that Jews had dual loyalties and were not good Germans.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

有一个人不仅对爱因斯坦的决定感到震惊，而且深感沮丧，那就是他在柏林的朋友兼同事——化学家哈伯。他已经脱离了犹太教，尽心尽力地同化自己，以显得像一个真正的普鲁士人。与其他同化论者一样，他也担心（这是可以理解的）爱因斯坦在犹太复国主义组织的要求下访问敌国会加剧一个信念，即犹太人脚踩两只船，不是优秀的德国人。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

In addition, Haber had been thrilled that Einstein was planning to attend the Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first since the war. No other Germans had been invited, and his attendance was seen as a crucial step for the return of Germany to the larger scientific community.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

不仅如此，哈伯还对爱因斯坦打算出席在布鲁塞尔举行的战后第一届索尔维会议感到不安。会议没有邀请其他德国人，爱因斯坦的与会被视为德国回到更大的科学共同体的关键一步。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

“People in this country will see this as evidence of the disloyalty of the Jews,” Haber wrote when he heard of Einstein’s decision to visit America. “You will certainly sacrifice the narrow basis upon which the <a id="filepos831996"></a>existence of professors and students of the Jewish faith at German universities rests.”<sup><a id="filepos832101"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792057">31</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

“这个国家的人民会认为你这种做法证明了犹太人的不忠，”哈伯在听说爱因斯坦决定访美时写信说，“你肯定会牺牲在德国大学信仰犹太教的教授和学生赖以生存的孱弱基础。” 

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Haber apparently had the letter delivered by hand, and Einstein replied the same day. He took issue with Haber’s way of regarding Jews as being people “of the Jewish faith” and instead, once again, cast the identity as being inextricably a matter of ethnic kinship. “Despite my emphatic internationalist beliefs, I have always felt an obligation to stand up for my persecuted and morally oppressed tribal companions,” he said. “The prospect of establishing a Jewish university fills me with particular joy, having recently seen countless instances of perfidious and uncharitable treatment of splendid young Jews with attempts to deny their chances of education.”<sup><a id="filepos832909"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792228">32</a></sup>

哈伯写下这封亲笔信之后，爱因斯坦当日便做出回复。他不赞同哈伯把犹太人看成“信仰犹太教”的民族，而是再次主张犹太人的身份认同必须涉及种族纽带。“尽管我自认为是国际主义者，但我一直感到有义务去维护我那些遭受迫害和精神折磨的部族同伴，”他说，“特别是正在筹建的犹太人大学使我充满了喜悦，最近我看到了太多对杰出的年轻犹太人不仁不义的对待，企图剥夺他们受教育的权利。”

And so it was that the Einsteins sailed from Holland on March 21, 1921, for their first visit to America. To keep things unpretentious and inexpensive, Einstein had said he was willing to travel steerage. The request was not granted, and he was given a nice stateroom. He also asked that he and Elsa be given separate rooms, both aboard the ship and at the hotels, so that he could work while on the trip. That request was granted.

It was, by all accounts, a pleasant Atlantic crossing, during which Einstein tried to explain relativity to Weizmann. Asked upon their arrival whether he understood the theory, Weizmann gave a delightful reply: “During the crossing, Einstein explained his theory to me every day, and by the time we arrived I was fully convinced that he really understands it.”<sup><a id="filepos833873"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792399">33</a></sup>

When the ship pulled up to the Battery in lower Manhattan on the afternoon of April 2, Einstein was standing on the deck wearing a faded gray wool coat and a black felt hat that concealed some but not all of his now graying shock of hair. In one hand was a shiny briar pipe; the other clutched a worn violin case. “He looked like an artist,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported. “But underneath his shaggy locks was a scientific mind whose deductions have staggered the ablest intellects of Europe.”<sup><a id="filepos834501"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792568">34</a></sup>

First he obediently followed directions for almost a half hour as the photographers and newsreel men ordered him and Elsa to strike a variety of poses. Then, in the captain’s cabin, he displayed more joy than reluctance as he conducted his first press briefing with all the wit and charm of a merry big-city mayor. “One could tell from his chuckling,” the reporter from the <em>Philadelphia Public Ledger</em> wrote, “that he enjoyed it.”<sup><a id="filepos835510"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792858">36</a></sup> His questioners enjoyed it as well.

Speaking through an interpreter, Einstein began with a statement about his hope “to secure the support, both material and moral, of American Jewry for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.” But the reporters were more interested in relativity, and the first questioner requested a one-sentence description of the theory, a request that Einstein would face at almost every stop on his trip. “All of my life I have been trying to get it into one book,” he replied, “and <em>he</em> wants me to get it into one sentence!” Pressed to try, he provided a simple overview: “It is a theory of space and time as far as physics is concerned, which leads to a theory of gravitation.”

The Einsteins and Weizmanns intended to head directly to the Hotel Commodore in Midtown.

The following day Einstein entertained a steady procession of visitors and, with what the <em>Times</em> called “an unusual impression of geniality,” he even held another press gathering. Why, he was asked, had he attracted such an unprecedented explosion of public interest? He professed to being puzzled himself. Perhaps a psychologist could determine why people who generally did not care for science had taken such an interest in him. “It seems psycho-pathological,” he said with a laugh.<sup><a id="filepos838901"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1793463">39</a></sup>

Anyone who has had sufficient training in science can readily understand the theory.” But this time Einstein made no attempt to explain it, nor did the reporter. “The <em>Tribune</em> regrets to inform its readers that it will be unable to present to them Einstein’s theory of relativity,” the article began. “After the professor explained that the most incidental discussion of the question would take from three to four hours, it was decided to confine the interview to other things.”<sup><a id="filepos846871"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1795675">46</a></sup>

应普林斯顿大学校长的要求，爱因斯坦所有的讲座都非常技术化。在用德语讲演的同时，他在黑板上写下了至少125个复杂的方程。一个学生对记者说：“虽然我坐在楼厅，但他讲的内容还是超出了我的理解力（talked right over my head）。”

At a party following one of these lectures, Einstein uttered one of his most memorable and self-revealing quotes. Someone excitedly informed him that word had just arrived of a new set of experiments improving on the Michelson-Morley technique that seemed to show that the ether existed and the speed of light was variable. Einstein simply refused to accept it. He knew that his theory was correct. And so he calmly responded, “Subtle is the Lord, but malicious he is not.”<a id="filepos848414"></a><a href="Einstein_split_063.html#filepos2416844">*</a>

在其中一场讲演结束之后的宴会上，爱因斯坦说出了他最令人难忘和最表露真情的一句话。有人兴奋地告诉他，最近有一些实验改进了迈克耳孙-莫雷实验的技巧，似乎表明以太存在，光速可变。爱因斯坦知道自己的理论是正确的，便没有理会。他平静地回答说：“上帝难以捉摸，但并不心怀恶意。”

The mathematics professor Oswald Veblen, who was standing there, heard the remark and, when a new math building was built a decade later, asked Einstein for the right to carve the words on the stone mantel of the fireplace in the common room. Einstein happily sent back his approval and further explained to Veblen what he had meant: “Nature hides her secret because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of ruse.”<sup><a id="filepos848944"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1796426">49</a></sup>

当时在场的数学教授奥斯瓦尔德·维布伦听到了这句话。10年后，一幢新的数学大楼在普林斯顿落成，维布伦希望将这句话刻在公共休息室的壁炉石架上，便去征求爱因斯坦的同意。爱因斯坦愉快地答应了请求，并向维布伦解释了他的意思：“大自然因其本性高贵而隐藏了自己的秘密，但并非通过诡计。”

<a id="filepos849043"></a>The building, neatly enough, later became the temporary home of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Einstein would have an office there when he immigrated to Princeton in 1933. Near the end of his life, he was in front of the fireplace at a retirement party for the mathematician Hermann Weyl, a friend who had followed him from Germany to Princeton when the Nazis took power. Alluding to his frustration with the uncertainties of quantum mechanics, Einstein nodded to the quote and lamented to Weyl, “Who knows, perhaps He <em>is</em> a little malicious.”<sup><a id="filepos849625"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797041">50</a></sup>

Some charged that this slight was due to the influence of a rival Zionist group in America led by Louis Brandeis, a graduate of Harvard Law School, who had become the first Jewish Supreme Court justice. The allegation was so widespread that Brandeis’s protégé Felix Frankfurter had to issue a public denial. That prompted an amused letter about the perils of assimilationism from Einstein to Frankfurter. It was “a Jewish weakness,” he wrote, “always and eagerly to try to keep the Gentiles in good humor.”<sup><a id="filepos851049"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797370">52</a></sup>

The very assimilated Brandeis, who had been born in Kentucky and had turned himself into a proper Bostonian, was an example of the Jews from Germany whose families had arrived in the nineteenth century and tended to look down on the more recent immigrants from eastern Europe and Russia.

While in Boston, Einstein was subjected to a pop quiz known as the Edison test. The inventor Thomas Edison was a practical man, getting crankier with age (he was then 74), who disparaged American colleges as too theoretical and felt the same about Einstein. He had devised a test he gave job applicants that, depending on the position being sought, included about 150 factual questions. How is leather tanned? What country consumes the most tea?

爱因斯坦在波士顿做了一次流行的“爱迪生测试”。发明者爱迪生是一个实际的人，随着时间的推移，他的脾气也越来越古怪（当时他岁）。他指责美国大学过于理论化，对爱因斯坦也有同样看法。他给求职者设计了一个测试，根据所谋职位，包括大约150个实际问题，比如说：皮革是如何鞣成的？哪个国家喝茶最多？谷腾堡活字是由什么制成的？

The <em>Times</em> called it “the ever-present Edison questionnaire controversy,” and of course Einstein ran into it. A reporter asked him a question from the test. “What is the speed of sound?” If anyone understood the propagation of sound waves, it was Einstein. But he admitted that he did not “carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books.” Then he made a larger point designed to disparage Edison’s view of education. “The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think,” he said.<sup><a id="filepos854161"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797954">55</a></sup>

《泰晤士报》称“爱迪生问卷引发的争论始终存在”，爱因斯坦当然也参与了这场争论。“声速是多少？”一位记者根据测试问他。如果有哪个人理解声波的传播，那肯定是爱因斯坦。但他承认自己并不“总是记得这些信息，因为它们在书中很容易查到”。接着，为了批驳爱迪生的教育观，他进而指出：“大学教育的价值并不在于学习许多事实，而在于训练如何思考。”

One remarkable feature of most stops on Einstein’s grand tour was a noisy parade, which was rather unusual for a theoretical physicist. In Hartford, Connecticut, for example, the procession included more than a hundred automobiles headed by a band, a coterie of war veterans, and standard-bearers with the American and Zionist flags. More than fifteen thousand spectators lined the route. “North Main Street was jammed by crowds that struggled to get close to shake hands,” the newspaper reported. “The crowds cheered wildly as Dr. Weizmann and Prof. Einstein stood up in the car to receive flowers.”<sup><a id="filepos854895"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798167">56</a></sup>

While in Cleveland, Einstein spoke at the Case School of Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve), where the famous Michelson-Morley experiments had been conducted. There he met privately, for more than an hour, with Professor Dayton Miller, whose new version of that experiment had provoked Einstein’s skeptical response at the Princeton cocktail party. Einstein drew sketches of Miller’s ether-drift models and urged him to continue refining his experiments. Miller remained dubious about relativity and partial to the ether, but other experiments eventually affirmed Einstein’s faith that the Lord was indeed more subtle than malicious.<sup><a id="filepos856237"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798564">58</a></sup>

The excitement, public outpouring, and dizzying superstar status conferred upon Einstein were unprecedented. But in financial terms, the tour was only a modest success for the Zionist movement. The poorer Jews and recent immigrants had poured out to see him and donated with enthusiasm. But few of the eminent and old-line Jews with great personal fortunes became part of the frenzy. They were, on the whole, more assimilated and less ardently Zionist. Weizmann had hoped to raise at least $4 million. By the end of the year, only $750,000 had actually been collected.<sup><a id="filepos856909"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798695">59</a></sup>

Even after his trip to America, Einstein did not become a full-fledged member of the Zionist movement.

In this regard, he was part of a momentous trend that was reshaping Jewish identity, by choice and by imposition, in Europe. “Until a generation ago, Jews in Germany did not consider themselves as members of the Jewish people,” he told a reporter on the day he was leaving America. “They merely considered themselves as members of a religious community.” But anti-Semitism changed that, and there was a silver lining to that cloud, he thought. “The undignified mania of trying to adapt and conform and assimilate, which happens among many of my social standing, has always been very repulsive to me,” he said.<sup><a id="filepos858235"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798833">60</a></sup>

By the beginning of 1923, the price of a loaf went to 700 marks and by the end of that year cost 1 billion marks. Yes, 1 billion.

Einstein had read Rathenau’s politics book in 1917, and over dinner told him, “I saw with astonishment and joy how extensive a meeting of minds there is between our outlooks on life.” Rathenau returned the compliment by reading Einstein’s popular explanation of relativity. “I do not say it comes easily to me, but certainly relatively easily,” he joked. Then he peppered Einstein with some very insightful questions: “How does a gyroscope know that it is rotating? How does it distinguish the direction in space toward which it does not want to be tilted?”<sup><a id="filepos862163"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1799530">62</a></sup>

爱因斯坦希望拉特瑙能够热心于犹太复国主义事业，便把他引荐给了魏茨曼和布卢门菲尔德。他们在爱因斯坦的住所和拉特瑙在柏林格鲁纳瓦尔德（Grunewald）的豪华庄园进行了会面，但拉特瑙不为所动。 他认为，最好的办法是让犹太人承担公共角色，成为德国权力结构的一部分。

Blumenfeld argued that it was wrong for a Jew to presume to run the foreign affairs of another people, but Rathenau kept insisting that he was a German. It was an attitude that was “all too typical of assimilated German Jews,” said Weizmann, who was contemptuous of German Jews who tried to assimilate, and especially of those courtiers who became what he dismissed as <em>Kaiserjuden.</em> “They seemed to have no idea that they were sitting on a volcano.”<sup><a id="filepos863516"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1799964">64</a></sup>

布卢门菲尔德认为，一个犹太人擅自去主管另一个民族的外交事务是错误的，但拉特瑙坚称自己是德国人。魏茨曼说，这是“同化了的德国犹太人的典型”态度。魏茨曼瞧不起那些竭力同化的德国犹太人，特别是那些被他斥之为“皇帝犹太人”（Kaiserjuden）的溜须拍马者。“他们似乎对自己坐在火山口浑然不觉。”

As foreign minister in 1922, Rathenau supported German compliance with the Treaty of Versailles and negotiated the Treaty of Rappallo with the Soviet Union, which caused him to be among the first to be labeled by the fledgling Nazi Party as a member of a Jewish-communist conspiracy. On the morning of June 24, 1922, some young nationalists pulled alongside the open car in which Rathenau was riding to work, sprayed him with machine-gun fire, lobbed in a hand grenade, and then sped away.

But not everyone felt sympathy. Adolf Hitler called the killers German heroes.

For Einstein, the assassination of Rathenau provided a bitter lesson: assimilation did not bring safety. “I regretted the fact that he became a government minister,” Einstein wrote in a tribute he sent to a German magazine. “In view of the attitude that large numbers of educated <a id="filepos865318"></a>Germans have towards Jews, I have always thought that the proper conduct of the Jews in public life should be one of proud reserve.”<sup><a id="filepos865468"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1800247">66</a></sup>

Einstein moved temporarily to Kiel, took a leave of absence from his teaching duties, and wrote to Planck, backing out of the speech he was scheduled to give to the annual convention of German scientists. Lenard and Gehrcke had led a group of nineteen scientists who published a “Declaration of Protest” aimed at barring him from that convention, and Einstein realized that his fame had come back to haunt him. “The newspapers have mentioned my name too often, thus mobilizing the rabble against me,” he explained in his note of apology to Planck.<sup><a id="filepos866393"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1800380">67</a></sup>

One option he considered briefly was a move to Kiel, on Germany’s Baltic coast, to work at an engineering firm there run by a friend. He had already developed for the firm a new design for a navigational gyroscope, which it patented in 1922 and for which he was paid 20,000 marks in cash.

The firm’s owner was surprised but thrilled when Einstein suggested that he might be willing to move there, buy a villa, and become an engineer rather than a theoretical physicist. “The prospect of a downright normal human existence in quietude, combined with the welcome chance of practical work in the factory, delights me,” Einstein said. “Plus the wonderful scenery, sailing—enviable!”

His inertia is hard to explain, but it is indicative of a change that became evident in both his personal life and his scientific work during the 1920s. He had once been a restless rebel who hopped from job to job, insight to insight, resisting anything that smacked of restraint. He had been repelled by conventional respectability. But now he personified it. From being a romantic youth who fancied himself a footloose bohemian he had settled, with but a few stabs at ironic detachment, into a bourgeois life with a doting hausfrau and a richly wallpapered home filled with heavy Biedermeier furniture. He was no longer restless. He was comfortable.

Despite his qualms about publicity and resolve to lie low, it was not in Einstein’s nature to shy away from saying what he thought. Nor was he always able to resist demands that he play a public role. Thus he showed up at a huge pacifist rally in a Berlin public park on August 1, just five weeks after Rathenau’s assassination. Although he did not speak, he agreed to be paraded around the rally in a car.<sup><a id="filepos869824"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801173">71</a></sup>

Earlier that year, he had joined the League of Nations’ International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which sought to promote a pacifist spirit among scholars, and he had persuaded Marie Curie to join as well. Its name and mission was sure to inflame German nationalists. So in the wake of the Rathenau assassination, Einstein declared that he wished to resign. “The situation here is that a Jew would do well to exercise restraint as regards his participation in political affairs,” he wrote a League official. “In addition, I must say that I have no desire to represent people who would certainly not choose me as their representative.”<sup><a id="filepos870603"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801316">72</a></sup>

Even that small act of public reticence did not hold.

For the next two years, he remained peripherally involved, but <a id="filepos870970"></a>eventually he broke with the League, partly because it supported France’s seizure of the Ruhr region after Germany was unable to make reparation payments.

He treated the League, as he did so many parts of life, with a slightly detached and amused air.

The unpleasant atmosphere in Germany made Einstein willing to take the most extensive tour of his life, a six-month excursion beginning in October 1922 that would be the only time he would travel either to Asia or what is now Israel. Wherever he went, he was treated as a celebrity, arousing within him the usual mixed emotions. Upon arrival in Ceylon, the Einsteins were whisked away by a waiting rickshaw.“We rode in small one-man carriages drawn at a trot by men of Herculean strength yet delicate build,” he noted in his travel diary. “I was bitterly ashamed to share responsibility for the abominable treatment accorded fellow human beings but was unable to do anything about it.”<sup><a id="filepos872666"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801752">74</a></sup>

In Singapore, almost the entire Jewish community of more than six hundred turned up at the dock, fortunately trailing no rickshaws.
