但也正是由于爱因斯坦的魅力及其外表的和蔼可亲，他也成就了这样一种看法，即现代物理学是常人无法理解的。用哈佛大学教授赫施巴赫的话说，这是“祭司般的（Priest-like）专家才能涉足的领地”。 但在历史上，情况却并非如此。伽利略和牛顿都是伟大的天才，但他们对世界的机械因果解释可以为大多数勤于思考的民众所理解。无论是18世纪的本杰明·富兰克林还是19世纪的托马斯·爱迪生，任何一个有教养的人都会感受到科学的亲和力，他们甚至可以以业余爱好者的身份涉足其中。

<p>A popular feel for scientific endeavors should, if possible, be restored given the needs of the twenty-first century. This does not mean that every literature major should take a watered-down physics course or that a corporate lawyer should stay abreast of quantum mechanics. Rather, it means that an appreciation for the methods of science is a useful asset for a responsible citizenry. What science teaches us, very significantly, is the correlation between factual evidence and general theories, something well illustrated in Einstein’s life.

21世纪要求尽可能地重新唤起大众对科学事业的感受。这并不意味着所有文学专业都要开设一门质量平平的物理课，也不意味着企业律师应当及时地了解量子力学的最新进展，而是指，对于一位能够明辨是非的公民而言，重视科学方法将会带来丰厚的回报。科学告诉我们，事实证据是如何与一般的理论关联起来的。在爱因斯坦的一生中，这一点得到了很好说明。

<p>In addition, an appreciation for the glories of science is a joyful trait for a good society.

此外，对于好的社会而言，能够对科学的荣耀引以为豪，这是令人欣慰的。它有助于我们保持那种孩童般的好奇心，对苹果落地、升降机起落等日常事件也能心怀惊异，这是爱因斯坦等大理论物理学家所共有的特征。

<p>That is why studying Einstein can be worthwhile. Science is inspiring and noble, and its pursuit an enchanting mission, as the sagas of its heroes remind us. Near the end of his life, Einstein was asked by the New York State Education Department what schools should emphasize. “In teaching history,” he replied, “there should be extensive discussion of personalities who benefited mankind through independence of character and judgment.”<sup><a id="filepos48803"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1587165">5</a></sup> Einstein fits into that category.

正因为此，研究爱因斯坦定会带来丰厚的回报。科学事鼓舞人心，是一项崇高而伟大的事业，就像科学家的传奇故事告诉我们的那样，这一使命让人心醉。爱因斯坦在晚年曾被纽约州教育厅问起，学校应当重视哪些东西。他回答说：“在讲授历史的时候，应当多讲述那些凭借性格和判断的独立性对人类有所贡献的人。”爱因斯坦当然亦属此列。

<p>At a time when there is a new emphasis, in the face of global competition, on science and math education, we should also note the other part of Einstein’s answer. “Critical comments by students should be taken in a friendly spirit,” he said. “Accumulation of material should not stifle the student’s independence.” A society’s competitive advantage will come not from how well its schools teach the multiplication <a id="filepos49391"></a>and periodic tables, but from how well they stimulate imagination and creativity.

在一个全球竞争日趋激烈，重新开始强调科学和数学教育的时代，我们也应当注意爱因斯坦所给出的另一部分回答。他说：“学生们的批评意见应当友好地加以斟酌。资料的积累不应扼杀学生的独立性。”一个社会的竞争优势不在于学校将乘法表和周期表讲得有多么好，而在于能在多大程度上激发起想象力和创造力。

<p>Therein lies the key, I think, to Einstein’s brilliance and the lessons of his life. As a young student he never did well with rote learning. And later, as a theorist, his success came not from the brute strength of his mental processing power but from his imagination and creativity. He could construct complex equations, but more important, he knew that math is the language nature uses to describe her wonders. So he could visualize how equations were reflected in realities—how the electromagnetic field equations discovered by James Clerk Maxwell, for example, would manifest themselves to a boy riding alongside a light beam. As he once declared, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.”<sup><a id="filepos50265"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1587399">6</a></sup>

在我看来，如果能够懂得这些话，那么爱因斯坦的卓尔不群和独特的人生道路也就不难理解了。他在做学生的时候，对机械的死记硬背从不感兴趣。后来能够成为成功的理论家，也并非由于他的头脑有处理问题的一股子蛮力，而是得益于其非凡的想象和创造力。他能构造出复杂的方程，但更为重要的是，他知道数学是大自然用来描述奇迹的语言，所以他会想象方程是如何在实在中得到表达的，比如在一个追光的孩子眼中，麦克斯韦发现的电磁场方程会是什么样。正如他所说：“想象远比知识更重要。”

<p>That approach required him to embrace nonconformity. “Long live impudence!” he exulted to the lover who would later become his wife. “It is my guardian angel in this world.” Many years later, when others thought that his reluctance to embrace quantum mechanics showed that he had lost his edge, he lamented, “To punish me for my contempt for authority, fate made me an authority myself.”<sup><a id="filepos50791"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1587645">7</a></sup>

当然，这就要求他不墨守成规。“放肆无礼万岁！”他曾对未来的妻子这样说，“这是我在这个世界上的守护天使。”许多年以后，人们认为他不愿接受量子力学，表明他已经失去了优势，对此他悲叹道：“为了惩罚我对权威的不敬，命运使我自己成了一个权威。”

<p>His success came from questioning conventional wisdom, challenging authority, and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals. Tyranny repulsed him, and he saw tolerance not simply as a sweet virtue but as a necessary condition for a creative society. “It is important to foster individuality,” he said, “for only the individual can produce the new ideas.”<sup><a id="filepos51400"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1588062">8</a></sup>

他的成功源于对传统观念的质疑，对权威的挑战，善于在他人不以为然的寻常事物中发现秘密。于是，他所倡导的德行和政治见解的前提必然是，尊重自由的思想、自由的精神和自由的个体。专制统治令他厌恶，在他看来，宽容不仅是一种美德，而且也是社会富于创造性的必要条件。“培养个性很重要，因为只有个人才能提出新的思想。”他这样说。
