The letter would turn out to bear some of the most significant tidings in the history of science, but its momentous nature was masked by an impish tone that was typical of its author.

<p>“The first deals with radiation and the energy properties of light and is very revolutionary,” he explained. Yes, it was indeed revolutionary. It argued that light could be regarded not just as a wave but also as a stream of tiny particles called quanta. The implications that would eventually arise from this theory—a cosmos without strict causality or certainty—would spook him for the rest of his life.

“第一篇论文讲的是辐射和光的能量特性，是非常革命性的。”他解释说。是的，它的确是革命性。它主张光不仅可以看成一种波，而且还可以看成一束微波的粒子，即所谓的量子。由这一理论将会导出一个不具有严格因果性或确定性的宇宙。在爱因斯坦一生中，这一结果将如幽灵一般，时不是地纠缠他。

<p>“The second paper is a determination of the true sizes of atoms.” Even though the very existence of atoms was still in dispute, this was the most straightforward of the papers, which is why he chose it as the safest bet for his latest attempt at a doctoral thesis. He was in the process of revolutionizing physics, but he had been repeatedly thwarted in his efforts to win an academic job or even get a doctoral degree, which he hoped might get him promoted from a third- to a second-class examiner at the patent office.

It would become known as the Special Theory of Relativity.

<p>Looking back at a century that will be remembered for its willingness to break classical bonds, and looking ahead to an era that seeks to nurture the creativity needed for scientific innovation, one person stands out as a paramount icon of our age: the kindly refugee from oppression whose wild halo of hair, twinkling eyes, engaging humanity, and extraordinary brilliance made his face a symbol and his name a synonym for genius. Albert Einstein was a locksmith blessed with imagination and guided by a faith in the harmony of nature’s handiwork.

<p>Now that his archives have been completely opened, it is possible to explore how the private side of Einstein—his nonconformist personality, his instincts as a rebel, his curiosity, his passions and detachments—intertwined with his political side and his scientific side. Knowing about the man helps us understand the wellsprings of his science, and vice versa. Character and imagination and creative genius were all related, as if part of some unified field.

<p>Despite his reputation for being aloof, he was in fact passionate in both his personal and scientific pursuits. At college he fell madly in love with the only woman in his physics class, a dark and intense Serbian <a id="filepos38592"></a>named Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. They had an illegitimate daughter, then married and had two sons. She served as a sounding board for his scientific ideas and helped to check the math in his papers, but eventually their relationship disintegrated. Einstein offered her a deal. He would win the Nobel Prize someday, he said; if she gave him a divorce, he would give her the prize money. She thought for a week and accepted. Because his theories were so radical, it was seventeen years after his miraculous outpouring from the patent office before he was awarded the prize and she collected.

<p>Einstein’s life and work reflected the disruption of societal certainties and moral absolutes in the modernist atmosphere of the early twentieth century. Imaginative nonconformity was in the air: Picasso, Joyce, Freud, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and others were breaking conventional bonds. Charging this atmosphere was a conception of the universe in which space and time and the properties of particles seemed based on the vagaries of observations.

<p>Einstein, however, was not truly a relativist, even though that is how he was interpreted by many, including some whose disdain was tinged by anti-Semitism. Beneath all of his theories, including relativity, was a quest for invariants, certainties, and absolutes. There was a harmonious reality underlying the laws of the universe, Einstein felt, and the goal of science was to discover it.

但事实上，爱因斯坦并不是一个相对主义者，即使许多人（包括某些因反犹而诋毁他的人）对他做这样的解释。在他所有的理论背后，包括相对论在内，都潜藏着一种对不变性、确定性和绝对性的追求。爱因斯坦认为，宇宙定律背后是一种和谐的实在，科学的目标就是去发现这种实在。

<p>His quest began in 1895, when as a 16-year-old he imagined what it would be like to ride alongside a light beam. A decade later came his miracle year, described in the letter above, which laid the foundations for the two great advances of twentieth-century physics: relativity and quantum theory.

他的探索始于1895年，那时他还是一个16岁的少年。他想像自己如果与一束光并肩前行会发生什么情况。十年之后，他前面信中描述的奇迹年降临了，这为20世纪物理学的两大进展－相对论和量子理论奠定了基础。

<p>A decade after that, in 1915, he wrested from nature his crowning glory, one of the most beautiful theories in all of science, the general theory of relativity. As with the special theory, his thinking had evolved through thought experiments. Imagine being in an enclosed elevator accelerating up through space, he conjectured in one of them. The effects you’d feel would be indistinguishable from the experience of gravity.

又过了十年，即1915年，他终于从自己中获取了至高的荣耀，这便是广义相对论－所有科学中最美的理论之一。和狭义相对论一样，他的思考也是通过思想实验进行的。假如你处于一个加速上升的封闭的升降机中，那么你所感受到的效应将无法区别于对引力的体验。

<p>Gravity, he figured, was a warping of space and time, and he came up with the equations that describe how the dynamics of this curvature <a id="filepos41205"></a>result from the interplay between matter, motion, and energy. It can be described by using another thought experiment. Picture what it would be like to roll a bowling ball onto the two-dimensional surface of a trampoline. Then roll some billiard balls. They move toward the bowling ball not because it exerts some mysterious attraction but because of the way it curves the trampoline fabric. Now imagine this happening in the four-dimensional fabric of space and time. Okay, it’s not easy, but that’s why we’re no Einstein and he was.

爱因斯坦的结论是，引力是时空弯曲所产生的一种效应，它种弯曲如何由物质、运动和能量所决定可以用方程来表示。我们可以借助另一个思想实验来解释。试想将一个保龄球置于二维的蹦床表面，然后在蹦床上滚动一些弹子球。这些弹子球会朝着保龄球运动，之所以如此，并不是因为保龄球对它们施加了某种神秘的吸引力，而是因为保龄球使蹦床的结构发生了弯曲。现在想像这发生于四维的时空结构中。当然，这并不容易，爱因斯坦毕竟是爱因斯坦。

<p>The exact midpoint of his career came a decade after that, in 1925, and it was a turning point. The quantum revolution he had helped to launch was being transformed into a new mechanics that was based on uncertainties and probabilities. He made his last great contributions to quantum mechanics that year but, simultaneously, began to resist it. He would spend the next three decades, ending with some equations scribbled while on his deathbed in 1955, stubbornly criticizing what he regarded as the incompleteness of quantum mechanics while attempting to subsume it into a unified field theory.

<p>Einstein’s nonconformist streak was evident in his personality and politics as well. Although he subscribed to socialist ideals, he was too much of an individualist to be comfortable with excessive state control or centralized authority.
