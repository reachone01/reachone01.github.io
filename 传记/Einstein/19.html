Einstein’s theory of relativity burst into the consciousness of a world that was weary of war and yearning for a triumph of human transcendence. Almost a year to the day after the end of the brutal fighting, here was an announcement that the theory of a German Jew had been proven correct by an English Quaker. “Scientists belonging to two warring nations had collaborated again!” exulted the physicist Leopold Infeld. “It seemed the beginning of a new era.”<sup><a id="filepos756729"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1772520">1</a></sup>

对一个厌倦了战争、渴望美好人性的世界来说，爱因斯坦的相对论不啻为一支强心剂。在那场残酷的战争结束一年后，有报道说，一个德国犹太人的理论被一个英国贵格派教徒所证实。“分属两个敌国的科学家再次合作！”物理学家英菲尔德欢呼道，“这似乎标志着一个新时代的开始。”

The <em>New York Times</em> caught up with the story two days later.<sup><a id="filepos757763"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1772999">3</a></sup> Not having a science correspondent in London, the paper assigned the story to its golf expert, Henry Crouch, who at first decided to skip the Royal Society announcement, then changed his mind, but then couldn’t get in. So he telephoned Eddington to get a summary and, somewhat baffled, asked him to repeat it in simpler words.<sup><a id="filepos758142"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1773158">4</a></sup>

两天后，《纽约时报》也急起直追做了报道。 由于《纽约时报》在伦敦没有科学记者，所以报道任务被分派给高尔夫行家亨利·克劳奇。他最初打算绕过皇家学会的公报，随后又改变了想法，但却读不懂这份公报。于是他打电话给爱丁顿索取一份摘要，并且不无尴尬地希望对方用较为易懂的话复述一下。

</div></div>



<div class="layout">

Perhaps due to Eddington’s enthusiasm in the retelling, or due to Crouch’s enthusiasm in the reporting, Eddington’s appraisal of Einstein’s theory was enhanced to read “one of the greatest—perhaps the greatest—of achievements in the history of human thought.”<sup><a id="filepos758552"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1773409">5</a></sup> But given the frenzy about to ensue, the headline was rather restrained:

For days the <em>New York Times,</em> with a bygone touch of merry populism, played up the complexity of the theory as an affront to common sense. “This news is distinctly shocking, and apprehensions for confidence even in the multiplication table will arise,” it editorialized on November 11. The idea that “space has limits” was most assuredly silly, the paper decided. “It just doesn’t, by definition, and that’s the end of it—for common folk, however it may be for higher mathematicians.” It returned to the theme five days later: “Scientists who proclaim that <a id="filepos759860"></a>space comes to an end somewhere are under some obligation to tell us what lies beyond it.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

一连数天，《纽约时报》带着往昔的平民主义笔调，对这一复杂理论大肆渲染，连篇累牍进行报道，视之为对常识的冒犯。“这一新闻着实令人震惊，它甚至会动摇我们对乘法表的信任。”《纽约时报》11月11日的社论说。这篇文章断定：“空间有界限”的想法必定愚不可及。“空间依据定义就不可能有界限。对普通民众来说，事情已到此为止，无论那些高深的数学家们对此有何看法。”五天后，它又回到了这一主题：“宣称空间有尽头的科学家们有义务告诉我们空间之外是什么。”

Finally, a week after its first story, the paper decided that some words of calm, more amused than bemused, might be useful. “British scientists seem to have been seized with something like an intellectual panic when they heard of photographic verification of the Einstein theory,” the paper pointed out, “but they are slowly recovering as they realize that the sun still rises—apparently—in the east and will continue to do so for some time to come.”<sup><a id="filepos760512"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1773575">6</a></sup>

一周之后，《纽约时报》觉得此时不妨说一些安慰性的俏皮话。“在听说爱因斯坦的理论得到照片证实后，英国科学家们似乎产生了理性恐慌，”《纽约时报》报道说，“直至他们意识到太阳（看上去）依旧从东方升起，并将一直这样持续下去时，他们才慢慢恢复了平静。”

An intrepid correspondent for the newspaper in Berlin was able to get an interview with Einstein in his apartment on December 2, and in the process launched one of the apocryphal tales about relativity. After describing Einstein’s top-floor study, the reporter asserted, “It was from this lofty library that he observed years ago a man dropping from a neighboring roof—luckily on a pile of soft rubbish—and escaping almost without injury. The man told Dr. Einstein that in falling he experienced no sensation commonly considered as the effect of gravity.” That was how, the article said, Einstein developed a “sublimation or supplement” of Newton’s law of gravity. As one of the stacked headlines of the article put it, “Inspired as Newton Was, But by the Fall of a Man from a Roof Instead of the Fall of an Apple.”<sup><a id="filepos761490"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1773783">7</a></sup>

12月2日，这家报纸驻柏林的一个无畏的通讯记者在爱因斯坦的寓所采访了他，并且炮制了一篇关于相对论的报道。在描述了顶楼的书房之后，这位记者断言：“几年前，他正是从这间书斋看到一个人从附近的房顶跌落下来。幸好这个人落在一堆软垃圾上而无大碍。这个人对爱因斯坦博士说，他在下落过程中没有感到通常的引力效应。”这篇文章说，爱因斯坦就是这样对牛顿万有引力定律进行了“升华或补充”。正如它的一个美妙标题所说：“虽然像牛顿一样受到启发，但灵感来自一个人从房顶落下，而不是苹果的落下。”

This was, in fact, as the newspaper would say, “a pile of soft rubbish.” Einstein had done his thought experiment while working in the Bern patent office in 1907, not in Berlin, and it had not involved a person actually falling. “The newspaper drivel about me is pathetic,” he wrote Zangger when the article came out. But he understood, and accepted, how journalism worked. “This kind of exaggeration meets a certain need among the public.”<sup><a id="filepos762069"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1773989">8</a></sup>

事实上，这篇文章才是“一堆软垃圾”。爱因斯坦1907年在伯尔尼专利局工作时就曾做过这个思想实验，而不是在柏林，而且它并不涉及某个人的实际坠落。“这家报纸关于我胡言乱语了一通，这真是可悲。”当文章发表时他给仓格尔写信说。不过他清楚新闻业的运作。“这种夸张迎合了公众的某种需要。”

There was, indeed, an astonishing public craving to understand relativity. Why? The theory seemed somewhat baffling, yes, but also very enticing in its mystery. Warped space?

Einstein’s friends found themselves besieged whenever they lectured on it. Leopold Infeld, who later worked with Einstein, was then a young schoolteacher in a small Polish town. “At the time, I did what hundreds of others did all over the world,” he recalled. “I gave a public lecture on the theory of relativity, and the crowd that lined up on a cold winter night was so great that it could not be accommodated in the largest hall in town.”<sup><a id="filepos763677"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1774533">10</a></sup>

每当举办相对论的讲座时，爱因斯坦的朋友们都很苦恼。后来与爱因斯坦共事的利奥波德·英菲尔德那时正在波兰的一个小城市当老师。“当时，我做的事情与全世界上百人做的事情一样，”他回忆说，“在寒冷的冬夜，我做了相对论的公开讲演，人们排了很长的队，甚至连城里最大的报告厅都容不下。”

The same thing happened to Eddington when he spoke at Trinity College, Cambridge. Hundreds jammed the hall, and hundreds more were turned away. In his attempt to make the subject comprehensible, Eddington said that if he was traveling at nearly the speed of light he would be only three feet tall. That made newspaper headlines. Lorentz likewise gave a speech to an overflow audience. He compared the earth to a moving vehicle as a way to illustrate some examples of relativity.<sup><a id="filepos764259"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1774749">11</a></sup>

爱丁顿在剑桥三一学院演讲时也是如此。数百人挤满了报告厅，还有几百人被挡在门外。为了让人们理解这一理论，爱丁顿举例说，如果以接近光速的速度旅行，那么他将只有3英尺高。这成了报纸的标题。洛伦兹也给许多听众做了讲演。他将地球比作一个行进中的交通工具，以此来说明相对论的某些例子。

Soon many of the greatest physicists and thinkers began writing their own books explaining the theory, including Eddington, von Laue, Freundlich, Lorentz, Planck, Born, Pauli, and even the philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell.

Einstein himself had the opportunity to explain it in his own words in <em>The Times</em> of London, which commissioned him to write an article called “What Is the Theory of Relativity?”<sup><a id="filepos764987"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1774916">12</a></sup> The result was actually quite comprehensible. His own popular book on the subject, <em>Relativity: The Special and General Theory,</em> had first appeared in German in 1916. Now, in the wake of the eclipse observation, Einstein published it in English as well. Filled with many thought experiments that could be easily visualized, it became a best seller, with updated editions appearing over the ensuing years.

爱因斯坦亲自在伦敦的《泰晤士报》上撰文解释相对论。他应约写了一篇文章——《什么是相对论？》。 结果可以想见。他关于这一主题的通俗读物《狭义与广义相对论浅说》最早于1916年出版德文版。而现在，日食观测刚刚完成，爱因斯坦又用英语发表了它。书中含有大量思想实验，它很快就成了畅销书，在许多年里一版再版。

Einstein had just the right ingredients to be transformed into a star. Reporters, knowing that the public was yearning for a refreshing international celebrity, were thrilled that the newly discovered genius was not a drab or reserved academic. Instead, he was a charming 40-year-old, just passing from handsome to distinctive, with a wild burst of hair, rumpled informality, twinkling eyes, and a willingness to dispense wisdom in bite-sized quips and quotes.

爱因斯坦很有理由被奉为偶像。记者们知道，公众渴望看到一个与众不同的国际名人。他们激动地发现，这位新近崭露头角的天才既不单调无趣，亦非性格保守的学究，而是一个年富力强、魅力十足的人。他风流倜傥，卓尔不群，神采奕奕，风趣幽默，有一头乱蓬蓬的头发，打扮不拘小节，常常妙语连珠。

His friend Paul Ehrenfest found the press attention rather ridiculous. “The startled newspaper ducks flutter up in a hefty bout of quacking,” he joked. To Einstein’s sister, Maja, who grew up at a time before people actually liked publicity, the attention was astonishing, and she assumed that he found it completely distasteful. “An article was published about you in a Lucerne paper!” she marveled, not fully appreciating that he had made front pages around the world. “I imagine this causes you much unpleasantness that so much is being written about you.”<sup><a id="filepos766756"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1775081">13</a></sup>

他的朋友埃伦菲斯特认为媒体的关注相当可笑。“受惊的报纸如鸭子鼓起翅膀嘎嘎乱叫。”他开玩笑说。爱因斯坦的妹妹玛雅成长于人们不爱出名的时代。在她看来，这种关注令人惊讶，她认为爱因斯坦非常厌恶这些东西。“一家卢采恩的报纸刊登了一篇关于你的文章！”她惊呼，当时她并不知道爱因斯坦已经占据了全世界的头版，“关于你写了这么多，想必这给你造成了许多不快。”

Einstein indeed bemoaned his newfound fame, repeatedly. He was being “hounded by the press and other riff-raff,” he complained to Max Born. “It’s so dreadful that I can barely breathe anymore, not to mention getting around to any sensible work.” To another friend, he painted an even more vivid picture of the perils of publicity: “Since the flood of newspaper articles, I’ve been so deluged with questions, invitations, and requests that I dream I’m burning in Hell and the postman is the Devil eternally roaring at me, hurling new bundles of letters at my head because I have not yet answered the old ones.”<sup><a id="filepos767523"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1775286">14</a></sup>

<p>
爱因斯坦的确多次哀叹过自己得到的名声。他正“被媒体和其他家伙穷追不舍”，他对玻恩抱怨说，“我几乎喘不过气来，更不要说抽出时间做任何有价值的工作了。”关于出名所带来的危险，他还向另一位朋友描绘了一幅更加生动的画面：“自从报纸文章泛滥成灾以来，我被大量问题、邀请和请求淹没了。我梦见自己正在地狱受煎熬，邮递员便是永远向我咆哮的魔鬼。他将一捆捆新信朝我头上掷来，因为我还没有回复旧信。”

Einstein’s aversion to publicity, however, existed a bit more in theory than in reality. It would have been possible, indeed easy, for him to have shunned all interviews, pronouncements, pictures, and public appearances. Those who truly dislike the public spotlight do not turn up, as the Einsteins eventually would, with Charlie Chaplin on a red carpet at one of his movie premieres.

然而，爱因斯坦对名声的厌恶更多是在理论上而不是现实中。对他来说，躲过所有的采访、声明、照相以及在大庭广众之下抛头露面不仅做得到，甚至是轻而易举的事。真正不喜欢镁光灯的人不会像爱因斯坦那样，与卓别林一起出席后者的一场电影首映式。

Einstein’s response to adulation was as complex as that of the cosmos to gravity. He was attracted and repelled by the cameras, loved publicity and loved to complain about it.

One reason that Einstein—unlike Planck or Lorentz or Bohr—became such an icon was because he looked the part and because he could, and would, play the role. “Scientists who become icons must not only be geniuses but also performers, playing to the crowd and enjoying public acclaim,” the physicist Freeman Dyson (no relation to the Astronomer Royal) has noted.<sup><a id="filepos769429"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1775712">16</a></sup> Einstein performed.

In the current celebrity-soaked age, it is hard to recall the extent to which, a century ago, proper people recoiled from publicity and disdained those who garnered it. Especially in the realm of science, focusing on the personal seemed discordant. When Einstein’s friend Max Born published a book on relativity right after the eclipse observations, he included, in his first edition, a frontispiece picture of Einstein and a short biography of him. Max von Laue and other friends of both men were appalled. Such things did not belong in a scientific book, even a popular one, von Laue wrote Born. Chastened, Born left these elements out of the next edition.<sup><a id="filepos770884"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1776056">18</a></sup>

在现在这个名人时代，很难想象一个世纪之前有教养的人对名声的畏惧和对名人的鄙视。特别是在科学领域，对个人的强调就更显得不和谐。爱因斯坦的朋友玻恩在日食观测后出版了一本相对论著作，他在第一版的扉页加了一张爱因斯坦的照片，还补充了他的传略。他们的许多朋友都非常惊愕。劳厄给玻恩写信说，这些东西不属于科学著作，甚至不属于科普著作。玻恩只好在新版中老老实实删去了这些内容。

As a result, Born was dismayed when it was announced in 1920 that Einstein had cooperated on a forthcoming biography by a Jewish journalist, <a id="filepos771124"></a>Alexander Moszkowski, who had mainly written humor and occult books. The book advertised itself, in the title, as being based on conversations with Einstein, and in fact it was. During the war, the gregarious Moszkowski had befriended Einstein, been solicitous of his needs, and brought him into a semiliterary circle that hung around at a Berlin café.

1920年有消息指出，爱因斯坦将与一位主要写幽默和神秘著作的犹太新闻记者莫什科夫斯基合写一本传记，玻恩听说后很恐慌。书的标题是基于同爱因斯坦的谈话，事实上也的确如此。战争期间，这位爱好交际的莫什科夫斯基把爱因斯坦当作朋友，对他关怀备至，还介绍他加入一个在柏林咖啡厅消磨时间的半文学圈子。

Born was a nonpracticing Jew eager to assimilate into German society, and he feared that the book would stoke the simmering antiSemitism. “Einstein’s theories had been stamped as ‘Jewish physics’ by colleagues,” Born recalled, referring to the growing number of German nationalists who had begun decrying the abstract nature and supposed moral “relativism” inherent in Einstein’s theories. “And now a Jewish author, who had already published several books with frivolous titles, came along and wanted to write a similar book on Einstein.” So Born and his wife, Hedwig, who never shied from berating Einstein, launched a crusade with their friends to stop its publication.

玻恩是一个不那么虔诚的犹太人，渴望融入德国社会。他担心这本书会激起蠢蠢欲动的反犹主义。越来越多的德国民族主义者已经开始谴责爱因斯坦理论内在的抽象性和所谓的道德“相对主义”。“爱因斯坦的理论被同行们贴上了‘犹太物理学’的标签，”玻恩说，“现在，一个曾写过几本无足轻重著作的犹太作家粉墨登场，也想写一本关于爱因斯坦的类似的书。”于是玻恩、妻子海德维希（她从不吝于指责爱因斯坦）和朋友们试图阻止这本书的出版。

“You must withdraw permission,” Hedwig hectored, “at once and by registered letter.” She warned him that the “gutter press” would use it to tarnish his image and portray him as a self-promoting Jew. “A completely new and far worse wave of persecution will be unleashed.” The sin, she emphasized, was not what he said but the fact that he was permitting any publicity for himself:

If Moszkowski refused to back off, Born advised Einstein to get a restraining order from the public prosecutor’s office. “Make sure this is reported in the newspapers,” he said. “I shall send you the details of <a id="filepos773870"></a>where to apply.” Like many of their friends, Born worried that Elsa was the one who was more susceptible to the lures of publicity.

倘若莫什科夫斯基拒不罢手，玻恩建议爱因斯坦请检察厅出面干预。“要确保在报纸上有所报道，”他说，“我会把申请细节寄给你。”和他们的许多朋友一样，玻恩也担心爱尔莎更容易受名声的诱惑。他对爱因斯坦说：“在这些事情上你是一个小孩子。我们都爱你，你必须听明智者（而不是你的妻子）的话。”

Einstein took the advice of his friends, up to a point, by sending Moszkowski a registered letter demanding that his “splendid” work not appear in print. But when Moszkowski refused to back down, Einstein did not invoke legal measures. Both Ehrenfest and Lorentz agreed that going to court would serve only to inflame the issue and make matters worse, but Born disagreed. “You can flee to Holland,” he said, referring to the ongoing effort by Ehrenfest and Lorentz to lure him there, but his Jewish friends who remained in Germany “would be affected by the stench.”<sup><a id="filepos774869"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1776507">21</a></sup>

爱因斯坦听从了朋友们的建议。他给莫什科夫斯基寄了一封挂号信，要求不要出版那本书。虽然莫什科夫斯基没有就范，但爱因斯坦并未诉诸法律。埃伦菲斯特和洛伦兹都认为，对簿公堂只能使问题激化，让事情变得更糟。但玻恩并不这样看。“你可以逃到荷兰”（因为埃伦菲斯特和洛伦兹一直希望爱因斯坦能过去，但他在德国的犹太人朋友“将会身陷危难”。

Einstein’s detachment allowed him to affect an air of amusement rather than anxiety. “The whole affair is a matter of indifference to me, as is all the commotion, and the opinion of <em>each and every</em> human being,” he said. “I will live through all that is in store for me like an unconcerned spectator.”<sup><a id="filepos775312"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1776664">22</a></sup>

In retrospect, the controversy over publicity seems quaint and the book harmless fluff. “I have browsed through it a little, and find it not quite as bad as I had expected,” Born later admitted. “It contains many rather amusing stories and anecdotes which are characteristic of Einstein.”<sup><a id="filepos776138"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1777634">24</a></sup>

回想起来，这场围绕名声展开的争论似乎有些古怪。那本书不过是无害的哗众取宠的读物。“我随意翻了翻，觉得并不像我预想的那么糟糕，”玻恩后来承认，“它写了许多相当有趣的故事和轶事，很有爱因斯坦特色。”

Einstein was able to resist letting his fame destroy his simple approach to life. On an overnight trip to Prague, he was afraid that dignitaries or curiosity-seekers would want to celebrate him, so he decided to stay with his friend Philipp Frank and his wife. The problem was that they actually lived in Frank’s office suite at the physics laboratory, where Einstein had once worked himself. So Einstein slept on the sofa there. “This was probably not good enough for such a famous man,” <a id="filepos776744"></a>Frank recalled, “but it suited his liking for simple living habits and situations that contravened social conventions.”

爱因斯坦并未因公众的注意而毁掉他简单的生活方式。有一次，在前往布拉格途中，为避免达官贵人或好事者的骚扰，爱因斯坦决定与他的朋友弗兰克夫妇住在一起。不过，他们当时住在弗兰克物理实验室（爱因斯坦曾经在那里工作过）的办公室套间，爱因斯坦只好睡在沙发上。“这与一个如此著名的人也许不够相称，”弗兰克回忆说，“但这符合他对简朴生活的热爱，即使与社会常规相抵触。”

Einstein insisted that, on the way back from a coffeehouse, they buy food for dinner so that Frank’s wife need not go shopping. They chose some calf ’s liver, which Mrs. Frank proceeded to cook on the Bunsen burner in the office laboratory. Suddenly Einstein jumped up. “What are you doing?” he demanded.“Are you boiling the liver in water?” Mrs. Frank allowed that was indeed what she was doing. “The boiling-point of water is too low,” Einstein declared. “You must use a substance with a higher boiling-point such as butter or fat.” From then on, Mrs. Frank referred to the necessity of frying liver as “Einstein’s theory.”

在从咖啡厅返回的路上，爱因斯坦提议买一些食物做晚餐，这样就省得弗兰克的妻子再去购物了。他们买了一些牛肝，弗兰克的妻子用实验室的煤气灯烹煮。突然，爱因斯坦惊呼，“你在做什么？用水煮牛肝吗？”弗兰克夫人点点头。“水的沸点太低了，”爱因斯坦说，“你必须使用一种沸点更高的东西，比如黄油或油脂。”从那以后，弗兰克的妻子便把必须用油煎肝称为“爱因斯坦理论”。

After Einstein’s lecture that evening, there was a small reception given by the physics department at which several effusive speeches were made. When it was Einstein’s turn to respond, he instead declared, “It will perhaps be pleasanter and more understandable if instead of making a speech I play a piece for you on the violin.” He proceeded to perform a sonata by Mozart with, according to Frank, “his simple, precise and therefore doubly moving manner.”

Einstein liked to cast himself as a loner. Although he had an infectious laugh, like the barking of a seal, it could sometimes be wounding <a id="filepos782437"></a>rather than warm. He loved being in a group playing music, discussing ideas, drinking strong coffee, and smoking pungent cigars.

爱因斯坦喜欢扮演孤独者的角色。尽管他的笑很有感染力，听起来有些像海豹的叫声，但有时会伤人，而不是温暖人心。他喜欢在一群人中演奏音乐，讨论想法，喝浓咖啡，抽刺鼻的雪茄，但他与家人和密友之间却隐隐隔着一堵墙。 从奥林匹亚科学院开始，他时常光顾思想的许多角落，但却回避了心灵的内室。

He did not like to be constricted, and he could be cold to members of his family. Yet he loved the collegiality of intellectual companions, and he had friendships that lasted throughout his life. He was sweet toward people of all ages and classes who floated into his ken, got along well with staffers and colleagues, and tended to be genial toward humanity in general. As long as someone put no strong demands or emotional burdens on him, Einstein could readily forge friendships and even affections.

This mix of coldness and warmth produced in Einstein a wry detachment as he floated through the human aspects of his world. “My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and communities,” he reflected. “I am truly a ‘lone traveler’ and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude.”<sup><a id="filepos784056"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1779367">32</a></sup>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
当爱因斯坦在人性的世界中游弋时，这种冷漠与热情在他那里交织成一种古怪的超然。“我有强烈的社会正义感和社会责任感，但又明显地缺乏与别人和社会直接接触的需求，这两者总是形成鲜明的对比，”他反思道，“我实在是一个‘孤独的过客’我从未全心全意地属于我的国家，我的家庭，我的朋友，甚至我最亲近的人。在所有这些关系面前，我从未失去距离感和保持孤独的需要。”

Even his scientific colleagues marveled at the disconnect between the genial smiles he bestowed on humanity in general and the detachment he displayed to the people close to him. “I do not know anyone as lonely and detached as Einstein,” said his collaborator Leopold Infeld. “His heart never bleeds, and he moves through life with mild enjoyment and emotional indifference. His extreme kindness and decency are thoroughly impersonal and seem to come from another planet.”<sup><a id="filepos784656"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1779611">33</a></sup>

甚至他的科学同事也很惊讶，为什么他对一般人会那样和蔼，而对周围的人却会显得漠然。“我不知道还有谁像爱因斯坦那样孤独和超然，”英菲尔德说，“他不会真正受到伤害，他的生活充满了淡淡的愉快和冷冷的情感。他的温文友善完全是不带感情的，这些东西似乎来自另一星球。”

Max Born, another personal and professional friend, noted the same trait, and it seemed to explain Einstein’s ability to remain somewhat oblivious to the tribulations afflicting Europe during World War I.“For all his kindness, sociability and love of humanity, he was nevertheless totally detached from his environment and the human beings in it.”<sup><a id="filepos785125"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1779968">34</a></sup>

<a id="filepos785224"></a>Einstein’s personal detachment and scientific creativity seemed to be subtly linked.

It is easier to be a nonconformist and rebel, both in science and in a militaristic culture like Germany’s, when you can detach yourself easily from others. “The detachment enabled him to walk through life immersed in thought,” Pais said. It also allowed him—or compelled him—to pursue his theories in both a “single-minded and single-handed” manner.<sup><a id="filepos785935"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1780134">35</a></sup>

爱因斯坦的超然与科学创造性之间似乎存在着微妙的联系。根据派斯的说法，这种超然源于爱因斯坦显著的“孤独”特征，这使他既可以拒斥科学传统，又可以回避亲密的感情。如果一个人很难被他人影响，那么无论在科学上还是在像德国这样的军国主义文化中，他都更容易打破羁绊，成为一名反叛者。派斯说，“这种超然使他能在思考中度过一生”，也（迫）使他“一心一意、单枪匹马地”追求自己的理论。

Einstein understood the conflicting forces in his own soul, and he seemed to think it was true for all people. “Man is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a social being,” he said.<sup><a id="filepos786243"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1780451">36</a></sup> His own desire for detachment conflicted with his desire for companionship, mirroring the struggle between his attraction and his aversion to fame. Using the jargon of psychoanalysis, the pioneering therapist Erik Erikson once pronounced of Einstein, “A certain alternation of isolation and outgoingness seems to have retained the character of a dynamic polarization.”<sup><a id="filepos786671"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1780679">37</a></sup>

爱因斯坦理解他灵魂当中相互冲突的力量，他似乎认为所有人都是如此。“人既是孤独的人，同时也是社会的人。”他说。 他本人就是冷漠超然与渴望友谊的矛盾体，这反映在他对名声的好恶上。精神分析的一位先驱者埃里克·埃里克森曾经这样评价爱因斯坦：“孤立隔绝与热情友好的交替轮换似乎保持了一种动态的极化（dynamic polarization）。”

Einstein’s desire for detachment was reflected in his extramarital relationships. As long as women did not make any claims on him and he felt free to approach them or not according to his own moods, he was able to sustain a romance. But the fear that he might have to surrender some of his independence led him to erect a shield.<sup><a id="filepos787110"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1780912">38</a></sup>

爱因斯坦的超然态度反映在他的婚外情上。只要女性不会对他有所要求，而且让他觉得可以自由接近，或者不受他的喜怒无常所左右，那么就能维持一段风流韵事。一旦担心可能失去某些自由，他就竖起盾牌。

This was even more evident in his relationship with his family. He was not always merely cold, for there were times, especially when it came to Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, that the forces of both attraction and repulsion raged inside him with a fiery heat. His problem, especially with his family, was that he was resistant to such strong feelings in others. “He had no gift for empathy,” writes historian Thomas Levenson, “no ability to imagine himself into the emotional life of anyone else.”<sup><a id="filepos787757"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1781111">39</a></sup> When confronted with the emotional needs of others, Einstein tended to retreat into the objectivity of his science.

在与家人的关系上，这一点反映得尤为清楚。他并非一味冷漠，因为有些时候，特别是米列娃令他爱恨交加。历史学家托马斯·利文森写道：“他不擅长理解别人的处境，没有能力设身处地为他人的感情生活着想。” 在面对他人的感情需要时，他会试图退回到科学的客观性当中。

Einstein stormed away angry, and once again their relationship deteriorated, especially after he received a nasty letter from Hans Albert. “He wrote me as no decent person has ever written their father,” he explained in a pained letter to his other son, Eduard. “It’s doubtful I’ll ever be able to take up a relationship with him again.”<sup><a id="filepos789825"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1781428">41</a></sup>

爱因斯坦大发雷霆，他们的关系又一次恶化了。汉斯·阿尔伯特还给他写了一封带有威胁口吻的信。“任何一个有分寸的人都不会像他那样给父亲写信，”在给另一个儿子爱德华的信中，他痛苦地说，“不知道我和他的关系日后还能否继续。”

So she emphasized to the boys that Einstein was “a strange man in many ways,” but he was still their father and wanted their love.

不过，米列娃希望改善他与儿子们的关系。于是她对孩子们说，爱因斯坦“在许多方面很古怪”，但他仍然是爸爸，需要他们的爱。他或许很冷漠，但也“很友善”。按照汉斯·阿尔伯特的说法：“米列娃知道，无论他怎样伪装，阿尔伯特的个人生活仍然可能受到伤害，而且伤害很深。”

Hans Albert went on to enroll at his parents’ alma mater, the Zurich Polytechnic, and became an engineer.

Especially after he scored first in his exams, his father not only became reconciled, but proud. “My Albert has become a sound, strong chap,” Einstein wrote Besso in 1924. “He is a total picture of a man, a first-rate sailor, unpretentious and dependable.”

One person who elicited strong and sustained personal emotions in Einstein was his mother. Dying from stomach cancer, she had moved in with him and Elsa at the end of 1919, and watching her suffer overwhelmed whatever human detachment he usually felt or feigned. When she died in February 1920, Einstein was exhausted by the emotions. “One feels right into one’s bones what ties of blood mean,” he wrote Zangger. Käthe Freundlich had heard him boast to her husband, the astronomer, that no death would affect him, and she was relieved that his mother’s death proved that untrue. “Einstein wept like other men,” she said, “and I knew that he could really care for someone.”<sup><a id="filepos792857"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1782418">45</a></sup>

<h3><span><strong><em>The Ripples from Relativity</em> 相对论引发的骚动</strong></span></h3>

<p>

For nearly three centuries, the mechanical universe of Isaac Newton, based on absolute certainties and laws, had formed the psychological foundation of the Enlightenment and the social order, with a belief in causes and effects, order, even <em>duty.</em> Now came a view of the universe, known as relativity, in which space and time were dependent on frames of reference. This apparent dismissal of certainties, an abandonment of faith in the absolute, seemed vaguely heretical to some people, perhaps even godless. “It formed a knife,” historian Paul Johnson wrote in his sweeping history of the twentieth century, <em>Modern Times,</em> “to help cut society adrift from its traditional moorings.”<sup><a id="filepos793818"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1782637">46</a></sup>

在将近300年的时间里，牛顿基于定律和绝对确定性的机械宇宙构成了启蒙运动和社会秩序的心理基础，人们对因果性、秩序甚至义务都深信不疑。现在出现了一种相对论宇宙观，其空间和时间均取决于参考系。在某些人看来，这种对确定性的明显违背和对绝对信念的公然抛弃的确有些异端，甚至有不敬神之嫌。历史学家保罗·约翰逊在其20世纪通史《现时代》（Modern Times）中写道：“它是一把利刃，可以帮助社会从传统中挣脱出来。”

The horrors of the great war, the breakdown of social hierarchies, the advent of relativity and its apparent undermining of classical physics all seemed to combine to produce uncertainty. “For some years past, the entire world has been in a state of unrest, mental as well as physical,” a Columbia University astronomer, Charles Poor, told the <a id="filepos794273"></a><em>New York Times</em> the week after the confirmation of Einstein’s theory was announced. “It may well be that the physical aspects of the unrest, the war, the strikes, the Bolshevist uprisings, are in reality the visible objects of some underlying deeper disturbance, worldwide in character. This same spirit of unrest has invaded science.”<sup><a id="filepos794646"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1783259">47</a></sup>

世界大战的恐怖、社会阶层的崩溃以及经典物理学的瓦解似乎都指向了不确定性。“在过去的若干年里，整个世界陷入了一种动荡之中，既有精神上的，也有物质上的，”哥伦比亚大学的天文学家普尔在爱因斯坦的理论得到证实之后对《纽约时报》说，“实际上，动荡、战争、罢工、布尔什维克起义的暴力特征很可能反映了整个世界背后的某种更深层扰动。这种动荡已经侵入了科学。”

Indirectly, driven by popular misunderstandings rather than a fealty to Einstein’s thinking, <em>relativity</em> became associated with a new <em>relativism</em> in morality and art and politics. There was less faith in absolutes, not only of time and space, but also of truth and morality. In a December 1919 editorial about Einstein’s relativity theory, titled “Assaulting the Absolute,” the <em>New York Times</em> fretted that “the foundations of all human thought have been undermined.”<sup><a id="filepos795277"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1783495">48</a></sup>

渐渐地，人们开始把相对论与道德、艺术和政治上的一种新的相对主义联系起来，这乃是源于一种流行的误解，它并不符合爱因斯坦实际的思想。人们对绝对的事物不那么信任了，不仅是时间和空间，还包括真理和道德。在1919年12月的一篇名为《攻击绝对》的关于相对论的社论中，《纽约时报》声称“一切人类思想的基础已被颠覆”。

Einstein would have been, and later was, appalled at the conflation of relativity with relativism. As noted, he had considered calling his theory “invariance,” because the physical laws of combined spacetime, according to his theory, were indeed invariant rather than relative.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦后来对把相对论与相对主义混为一谈感到惊愕。我们说过，他曾经想把相对论称为“不变性”理论，因为根据相对论，结合后的时空所遵循的物理定律实际上是不变的，而不是相对的。

Moreover, he was not a relativist in his own morality or even in his taste. “The word relativity has been widely misinterpreted as relativism, the denial of, or doubt about, the objectivity of truth or moral values,” the philosopher Isaiah Berlin later lamented. “This was the opposite of what Einstein believed. He was a man of simple and absolute moral convictions, which were expressed in all he was and did.”<sup><a id="filepos796163"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1783655">49</a></sup>

<p>
此外，他本人在道德和品位上也并非相对主义者。“相对论一词已经被广泛误解为相对主义，即否认或怀疑真理或道德价值具有客观性，”哲学家以赛亚·伯林后来悲叹道，“这恰恰与爱因斯坦的看法相反。他是一个质朴的、具有绝对道德信念的人，他的经历和所做的一切都表明了这一点。”

In both his science and his moral philosophy, Einstein was driven by a quest for certainty and deterministic laws. If his theory of relativity produced ripples that unsettled the realms of morality and culture, this was caused not by what Einstein believed but by how he was popularly interpreted.

无论是科学还是道德哲学，爱因斯坦都力图寻求确定性和决定论定律。如果他的相对论引发了骚动，扰乱了道德文化领域，这并非源于爱因斯坦的思想，而是因为人们对其做了通俗解释。

One of those popular interpreters, for example, was the British statesman Lord Haldane, who fancied himself a philosopher and scientific scholar. In 1921, he published a book called <em>The Reign of Relativity,</em> which enlisted Einstein’s theory to support his own political views on the need to avoid dogmatism in order to have a dynamic society. “Einstein’s principle of the relativity of our measurements of space and time cannot be taken in isolation,” he wrote. “When its import is considered it may well be found to have its counterpart in other domains of nature and of knowledge generally.”<sup><a id="filepos797258"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1784345">50</a></sup>

例如，英国政治家理查德·伯登·霍尔丹勋爵便是这样一位通俗解释者，他自认为是一个哲学家和科学家。1921年，他出版了一本名为《相对论的统治》（The Reign of Relativity）的书，试图用爱因斯坦的理论来支持他个人的政治观点，即需要避免教条主义才能使社会生气勃勃。“爱因斯坦关于空间时间测量的相对性原理不应孤立思考，”他写道，“倘若我们思考它的意义，就可以在其他自然领域和一般知识领域找到它的对应。”

<a id="filepos797357"></a>Relativity theory would have profound consequences for theology, Haldane warned the archbishop of Canterbury, who immediately tried to comprehend the theory with only modest success. “The Archbishop,” one minister reported to the dean of English science, J. J. Thomson, “can make neither head nor tail of Einstein, and protests that the more he listens to Haldane, and the more newspaper articles he reads on the subject, the less he understands.”

霍尔丹警告坎特伯雷大主教，相对论可能会对神学产生深刻影响。大主教立即着手研究这一理论，但收效不大。一位大臣对英国科学的泰斗汤姆孙说：“大主教完全弄不懂爱因斯坦，他抱怨道，霍尔丹的解说和相关的报纸文章只能让他更加糊涂。”

Haldane persuaded Einstein to come to England in 1921. He and Elsa stayed at Haldane’s grand London townhouse, where they found themselves completely intimidated by their assigned footman and butler. The dinner that Haldane hosted in Einstein’s honor convened a pride of English intellectuals leonine enough to awe an Oxford senior common room. Among those present were George Bernard Shaw, Arthur Eddington, J. J. Thomson, Harold Laski, and of course the baffled archbishop of Canterbury, who got a personal briefing from Thomson in preparation.

在霍尔丹的劝说下，爱因斯坦1921年来到英国。爱因斯坦和爱尔莎住在伦敦市政厅，他们发现男仆和管家已经为他们安排好一切。霍尔丹为爱因斯坦举行了一场盛大的宴会，召集了英国知识界的各路精英，其场面足以使牛津资深教授共宴厅（senior common room）相形见绌。出席的人士有萧伯纳、爱丁顿、汤姆孙、哈罗尔德·拉斯基等人，当然还有那位一头雾水的坎特伯雷大主教。在准备这件事的过程中，他从汤姆孙那里得到了一份爱因斯坦的简介。

Haldane seated the archbishop next to Einstein, so he got to pose his burning question directly to the source. What ramifications, His Grace inquired, did the theory of relativity have for religion?

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

The answer probably disappointed both the archbishop and their host. “None,” Einstein said. “Relativity is a purely scientific matter and has nothing to do with religion.”<sup><a id="filepos798962"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1784606">51</a></sup>

That was no doubt true. However, there was a more complex relationship between Einstein’s theories and the whole witch’s brew of ideas and emotions in the early twentieth century that bubbled up from the highly charged cauldron of modernism. In his novel <em>Balthazar,</em> Lawrence Durrell had his character declare, “The Relativity proposition was directly responsible for abstract painting, atonal music, and formless literature.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
这无疑是正确的。然而，爱因斯坦的理论与20世纪初在现代主义的背景下涌现出的各种思想感情有着更复杂的关联。在劳伦斯·杜雷尔的小说《巴尔萨泽》（Balthazar）中，主人公宣布：“相对论对抽象绘画、无调性音乐和无形式文学负有直接责任。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

The relativity proposition, of course, was <em>not</em> directly responsible for any of this. Instead, its relationship with modernism was more mysteriously interactive. There are historical moments when an alignment of forces causes a shift in human outlook. It happened to art and philosophy and science at the beginning of the Renaissance, and again at the beginning of the Enlightenment. Now, in the early twentieth century, modernism was born by the breaking of the old strictures and <a id="filepos800066"></a>verities. A spontaneous combustion occurred that included the works of Einstein, Picasso, Matisse, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Joyce, Eliot, Proust, Diaghilev, Freud, Wittgenstein, and dozens of other path-breakers who seemed to break the bonds of classical thinking.<sup><a id="filepos800341"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1784782">52</a></sup>

<p>
当然，相对论对其中任何一项都没有直接责任，它与现代主义更多是神秘地相互作用。在历史的某些时段，各种力量共同造成了人的观念的转变。在文艺复兴和启蒙运动之初，艺术、哲学和科学都发生了这种转变。20世纪初，通过打破已有的限制和真理观，现代主义应运而生。爱因斯坦、毕加索、马蒂斯、斯特拉文斯基、勋伯格、乔伊斯、艾略特、普鲁斯特、佳吉列夫、弗洛伊德、维特根斯坦等一大批打破古典思维羁绊的开拓者涌现出来。

In his book <em>Einstein, Picasso: Space,Time, and the Beauty That Causes Havoc,</em> the historian of science and philosophy Arthur I.

在《爱因斯坦·毕加索：空间、时间和动人心魄之美》一书中，科学史家和哲学史家米勒特别探讨了爱因斯坦1905年狭义相对论和毕加索1907年的现代派杰作《阿维尼翁的少女》（Les Demoiselles d'Avignon）等的共同源泉。米勒指出，这两个人都魅力无穷，“但在感情上都表现出淡漠”。他们均以自己的方式觉察到各自领域的某些陈规出了问题。他们都对同时性、空间、时间，特别是庞加莱的著作非常感兴趣。

Einstein served as a source of inspiration for many of the modernist artists and thinkers, even when they did not understand him. This was especially true when artists celebrated such concepts as being “free from the order of time,” as Proust put it in the closing of <em>Remembrance of Things Past.</em> “How I would love to speak to you about Einstein,” Proust wrote to a physicist friend in 1921. “I do not understand a single word of his theories, not knowing algebra. [Nevertheless] it seems we have analogous ways of deforming Time.”<sup><a id="filepos801768"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1785198">54</a></sup>

爱因斯坦为许多现代派艺术家和思想家提供了灵感，即使他们并不了解爱因斯坦。比如艺术家们会歌颂像“从时间的秩序中解放出来”这样的观念，这是普鲁斯特在《追忆逝水年华》（Rememberance of Things Past）的结尾说的话。“我多想和你谈谈爱因斯坦啊，”普鲁斯特1921年给一个物理学家朋友写信说，“我不懂代数，他的理论我一点儿也不明白。[但]我们在扭曲时间方面似乎有异曲同工之妙。”

A pinnacle of the modernist revolution came in 1922, the year Einstein’s Nobel Prize was announced. James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> was published that year, as was T. S. Eliot’s <em>The Waste Land.</em> There was a midnight dinner party in May at the Majestic Hotel in Paris for the opening of <em>Renard,</em> composed by Stravinsky and performed by Diaghilev’s <em>Ballets Russes.</em> Stravinsky and Diaghilev were both there, as was Picasso. So, too, were both Joyce and Proust, who “were destroying 19th century literary certainties as surely as Einstein was revolutionizing physics.” The mechanical order and Newtonian laws that had defined classical physics, music, and art no longer ruled.<sup><a id="filepos802604"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1785375">55</a></sup>

1922年，也就是爱因斯坦获诺贝尔奖的那一年，是现代主义革命的一个顶峰。乔伊斯的《尤利西斯》（Ulysses）和艾略特的《荒原》（The Waste Land）在这一年出版。当年5月，为庆祝佳吉列夫的俄罗斯芭蕾舞团表演的斯特拉文斯基的《狐狸》（Renard）首演，巴黎的马捷斯特饭店（Majestic Hotel）举行了一场午夜晚宴。斯特拉文斯基、佳吉列夫、毕加索都出席了，乔伊斯和普鲁斯特也在。他们“正在摧毁19世纪文学的确定性，就像爱因斯坦使物理学发生革命那样”。曾经规定着经典物理学、音乐和艺术的机械秩序和牛顿定律已经不再有效。

Whatever the causes of the new relativism and modernism, the untethering of the world from its classical moorings would soon produce some unnerving reverberations and reactions. And nowhere was that mood more troubling than in Germany in the 1920s.

不论这种新的相对主义和现代主义的原因为何，使世界冲破古典樊篱很快就会引起某些令人不安的回响和反应。20世纪20年代，这种情绪在德国尤其令人担忧。
