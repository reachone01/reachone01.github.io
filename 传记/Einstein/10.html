<p>The Zurich Polytechnic, with 841 students, was mainly a teachers’ and technical college when 17-year-old Albert Einstein enrolled in October 1896. It was less prestigious than the neighboring University of Zurich and the universities in Geneva and Basel, all of which could grant doctoral degrees (a status that the Polytechnic, officially named the Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule, would attain in 1911 when it became the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, or ETH). Nevertheless, the Polytechnic had a solid reputation in engineering and science. The head of the physics department, Heinrich Weber, had recently procured a grand new building, funded by the electronics magnate (and Einstein Brothers competitor) Werner von Siemens. It housed showcase labs famed for their precision measurements.

1896年10月，17岁的爱因斯坦考入了苏黎世联邦工学院。这所学院当时共有841名学生，主要是一所技术师范学院。它虽然名气不如附近的苏黎世大学以及日内瓦和巴塞尔的大学，这些学校都可以授予博士学位[直到1911年苏黎世联邦工学院（Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule）更名为“联邦理工大学”（Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule，简称ETH）时才具有这一资格]，但在工程和科学方面却有着良好的声誉。物理系主任韦伯最近争取到了一幢崭新的大楼，由电子行业巨头（也是爱因斯坦兄弟公司的对手）西门子公司出资兴建。楼内有一批以精密测量而闻名的示范实验室。

<p>Einstein was one of eleven freshmen enrolled in the section that provided training “for specialized teachers in mathematics and physics.” He lived in student lodgings on a monthly stipend of 100 Swiss francs from his Koch family relatives. Each month he put aside 20 of those francs toward the fee he would eventually have to pay to become a Swiss citizen.<sup><a id="filepos119889"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1606545">1</a></sup>

爱因斯坦等11名新生接受了“数学和物理学专业教师”培训。他住在学生公寓里，每月从科赫亲戚那里拿100瑞士法郎的定期津贴。每个月他要从中拿出20法郎交给政府，这是成为瑞士公民所必须缴纳的费用。

<p>Theoretical physics was just coming into its own as an academic discipline in the 1890s, with professorships in the field sprouting up across Europe. Its pioneer practitioners—such as Max Planck in Berlin, <a id="filepos120199"></a>Hendrik Lorentz in Holland, and Ludwig Boltzmann in Vienna—combined physics with math to suggest paths where experimentalists had yet to tread. Because of this, math was supposed to be a major part of Einstein’s required studies at the Polytechnic.

19世纪90年代，理论物理学已经日趋独立，欧洲出现了不少该领域的教授。柏林的马克斯·普朗克、荷兰的亨德里克·洛伦兹、维也纳的路德维希·玻尔兹曼等人就是第一批理论物理教授。他们将物理学与数学结合在一起，为实验物理学家指明前进方向。因此，数学必定是爱因斯坦在联邦工学院的主要必修课。

<div class="left">
<p>Einstein, however, had a better intuition for physics than for math, and he did not yet appreciate how integrally the two subjects would be related in the pursuit of new theories. During his four years at the Polytechnic, he got marks of 5 or 6 (on a 6-point scale) in all of his theoretical physics courses, but got only 4s in most of his math courses, especially those in geometry. “It was not clear to me as a student,” he admitted, “that a more profound knowledge of the basic principles of physics was tied up with the most intricate mathematical methods.”<sup><a id="filepos121113"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1606720">2</a></sup>

<p>
不过，爱因斯坦对物理学的直觉能力还是要强于数学。在探索新理论的过程中，他尚未认识到这两门学科可以有机地结合在一起。在联邦工学院的四年学习中，他所有的理论物理课程都得了5分（满分为6分），而大部分数学课，特别是几何学，都只得了4分。他承认：“学生时代的我还不明白，更深入地理解物理学基本原理是同最复杂的数学方法联系着的。”

</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>That realization would sink in a decade later, when he was wrestling with the geometry of his theory of gravity and found himself forced to rely on the help of a math professor who had once called him a lazy dog. “I have become imbued with great respect for mathematics,” he wrote to a colleague in 1912, “the subtler part of which I had in my simple-mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now.” Near the end of his life, he expressed a similar lament in a conversation with a younger friend. “At a very early age, I made an assumption that a successful physicist only needs to know elementary mathematics,” he said. “At a later time, with great regret, I realized that the assumption of mine was completely wrong.”<sup><a id="filepos121981"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1606859">3</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


这种领悟要到10年之后才能浮现出来。那时他正在为引力理论的几何学而绞尽脑汁，发现自己不得不依靠一位曾经称自己为“懒狗”的数学教授的帮助。“我已经开始变得对数学充满敬意，”他1912年给同事写信说，“直到现在，我还愚蠢地将数学中比较精妙的内容当成纯粹的奢侈。”到了晚年，他在与一位年轻朋友彼得·巴基谈话时，也有过类似的悲叹。他说：“早先我以为一个成功的物理学家只要懂得初等数学就够了，但后来我十分遗憾地认识到，这种想法是完全错误的。”

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>His primary physics professor was Heinrich Weber, the one who a year earlier had been so impressed with Einstein that, even after he had failed his entrance exam to the Polytechnic, he urged him to stay in Zurich and audit his lectures. During Einstein’s first two years at the Polytechnic, their mutual admiration endured. Weber’s lectures were among the few that impressed him. “Weber lectured on heat with great mastery,” he wrote during their second year. “One lecture after another of his pleases me.” He worked in Weber’s laboratory “with fervor and passion,” took fifteen courses (five lab and ten classroom) with him, and scored well in them all.<sup><a id="filepos122792"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1607121">4</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
韦伯是这里主要的物理教授。一年前，爱因斯坦给这位教授留下了深刻的印象。那时爱因斯坦没能通过联邦工学院的入学考试，他敦促爱因斯坦留在苏黎世听他的课。入学之后，他们在头两年里依然相互褒奖。韦伯的课是少数几门令他印象深刻的课。“韦伯讲授热学的技巧高超而娴熟，”他在第二年写道，“他上的每一门课我都很喜欢。”他“怀着极大的热情”在韦伯的实验室中工作，选修了他的十五门课（五门实验课，十门理论课），而且考得都很好。



</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein, however, gradually became disenchanted with Weber. He felt that the professor focused too much on the historical foundations of physics, and he did not deal much with contemporary frontiers. <a id="filepos123091"></a>“Anything that came after Helmholtz was simply ignored,” one contemporary of Einstein complained. “At the close of our studies, we knew all the past of physics but nothing of the present and future.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
不过，爱因斯坦渐渐对韦伯失去了兴趣。他感到这位教授过分专注于物理学的历史基础，而不注重当下的前沿。“他不关注亥姆霍兹之后的一切东西，”当时有人这样抱怨说，“在学习结束的时候，我们对物理学的过去一清二楚，而对它的现在和未来却一无所知。”



</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Notably absent from Weber’s lectures was any exploration of the great breakthroughs of James Clerk Maxwell, who, beginning in 1855, developed profound theories and elegant mathematical equations that described how electromagnetic waves such as light propagated. “We waited in vain for a presentation of Maxwell’s theory,” wrote another fellow student. “Einstein above all was disappointed.”<sup><a id="filepos123809"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1607327">5</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
韦伯在课上没有讲述的内容之一就是麦克斯韦的重大突破。从1855年开始，麦克斯韦提出了深奥的理论和优雅的数学方程来描述像光这样的电磁波是如何传播的。“我们企盼着能够讲讲麦克斯韦理论，到头来却是一场空，”另一位学生写道，“爱因斯坦失望透了。”



</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Given his brash attitude, Einstein didn’t hide his feelings. And given his dignified sense of himself, Weber bristled at Einstein’s ill-concealed disdain. By the end of their four years together they were antagonists.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦向来直来直去，丝毫不掩饰自己的感受。韦伯则出于体面，对爱因斯坦愤懑的倨傲态度大为光火。到了第四年年底，他们已经到了几乎水火不容的境地。

</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Weber’s irritation was yet another example of how Einstein’s scientific as well as personal life was affected by the traits deeply bred into his Swabian soul: his casual willingness to question authority, his sassy attitude in the face of regimentation, and his lack of reverence for received wisdom. He tended to address Weber, for example, in a rather informal manner, calling him “Herr Weber” instead of “Herr Professor.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
韦伯对爱因斯坦的愤怒再次证明，爱因斯坦的科学和个人生活多么受制于那个施瓦本灵魂深处的东西，即习惯于挑战权威，不服管制，对公认的观点缺乏尊重。例如，他经常漫不经心地称韦伯为“韦伯先生”，而不是“教授先生”。



</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>When his frustration finally overwhelmed his admiration, Professor Weber’s pronouncement on Einstein echoed that of the irritated teacher at the Munich gymnasium a few years earlier. “You’re a very clever boy, Einstein,” Weber told him. “An extremely clever boy. But you have one great fault: you’ll never let yourself be told anything.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
韦伯教授的愤怒最终还是胜过了赞赏，他对爱因斯坦的断言让人想起了几年前慕尼黑高中的那位气急败坏的老师。“爱因斯坦，你是个非常聪明的孩子，可以说聪明过人，”韦伯对他说，“但你有一个大毛病：你从不听别人说什么。”



</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>There was some truth to that assessment. But Einstein was to show that, in the jangled world of physics at the turn of the century, this insouciant ability to tune out the conventional wisdom was not the worst fault to have.<sup><a id="filepos125375"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1607626">6</a></sup>
</p>
</div>

这种评价不无道理。不过爱因斯坦将会表明，在世纪之交的那个波谲云诡的物理学世界，不去理会时下的流行观点不无裨益。

<div class="left">
<p>Einstein’s impertinence also got him into trouble with the Polytechnic’s other physics professor, Jean Pernet, who was in charge of experimental and lab exercises. In his course Physical Experiments for Beginners, Pernet gave Einstein a 1, the lowest possible grade, thus earning himself the historic distinction of having flunked Einstein in a physics course. Partly it was because Einstein seldom showed up for the course. At Pernet’s written request, in March 1899 Einstein was <a id="filepos125972"></a>given an official “director’s reprimand due to lack of diligence in physics practicum.”<sup><a id="filepos126089"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1607864">7</a></sup>

爱因斯坦的无礼也冒犯了联邦工学院的另一位物理教授让·佩尔内，他负责爱因斯坦的实验课和物理实习。在佩尔内开设的“物理实验入门”课上，他给了爱因斯坦最低分1分，从而在历史上留下了这样一个名声：他使爱因斯坦的一门物理课没有通过。爱因斯坦很少来上这门课也是一个重要原因。根据佩尔内的书面建议，1899年3月，“由于对物理实习课不够重视”，爱因斯坦受到“校长的一次申斥”。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Why are you specializing in physics, Pernet asked Einstein one day, instead of a field like medicine or even law? “Because,” Einstein replied, “I have even less talent for those subjects. Why shouldn’t I at least try my luck with physics?”<sup><a id="filepos126461"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1608024">8</a></sup>

</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
有一次，佩尔内问爱因斯坦为什么要研究物理学，而不是医学或法律等领域，爱因斯坦回答说：“因为我在那些学科上的天资更浅。我何不在物理学上碰碰运气呢？”



</p>
</div></div>


<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>On those occasions when Einstein did deign to show up in Pernet’s lab, his independent streak sometimes got him in trouble, such as the day he was given an instruction sheet for a particular experiment. “With his usual independence,” his friend and early biographer Carl Seelig reports, “Einstein naturally flung the paper in the waste paper basket.” He proceeded to pursue the experiment in his own way. “What do you make of Einstein?” Pernet asked an assistant. “He always does something different from what I have ordered.”

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
有那么几次，爱因斯坦终于光临了佩尔内的实验室，但他那独立的个性有时又会惹上麻烦。比如有一天，老师让他按照纸上的说明做一个特殊的实验。“凭借着一贯的独立性，”卡尔·塞利希说，“爱因斯坦自然将这张纸扔进了废纸篓。”他按照自己的方式进行实验。佩尔内问一位助手：“你拿爱因斯坦有什么办法？他总是不照我说的去做。”

<p>Eventually, these methods caught up with him. In July 1899, he caused an explosion in Pernet’s lab that “severely damaged” his right hand and required him to go to the clinic for stitches. The injury made it difficult for him to write for at least two weeks, and it forced him to give up playing the violin for even longer. “My fiddle had to be laid aside,” he wrote to a woman he had performed with in Aarau. “I’m sure it wonders why it is never taken out of the black case. It probably thinks it has gotten a stepfather.”<sup><a id="filepos128032"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1608358">10</a></sup> He soon resumed playing the violin, but the accident seemed to make him even more wedded to the role of theorist rather than experimentalist.

终于，这些方法使他受到了惩罚。1899年7月的一天，他在佩尔内的实验室酿成了一次爆炸，右手“伤势严重”，不得不到诊所缝合伤口。这次事故使他至少在两周内难以拿笔写东西，小提琴就更没法拉了。“我的小提琴只能弃置一旁，”他写信给曾经在阿劳同台演出的一位女士说，“它肯定感到很奇怪，自己竟然再没有从黑匣子里出来过。或许它以为，自己遇上了个继父吧。”不久，他又可以重新拉琴了，不过这次事故似乎使他更加热衷于当理论家而不是实验家了。

<p>Despite the fact that he focused more on physics than on math, the professor who would eventually have the most positive impact on him was the math professor Hermann Minkowski, a square-jawed, handsome Russian-born Jew in his early thirties. Einstein appreciated the way Minkowski tied math to physics, but he avoided the more challenging of his courses, which is why Minkowski labeled him a lazy dog: “He never bothered about mathematics at all.”<sup><a id="filepos128737"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1608519">11</a></sup>

尽管他对物理的重视甚于数学，但给他最正面影响的教授却是数学家赫尔曼·闵可夫斯基。他是俄裔犹太人，当时只有30岁出头，方方的下巴，可以说相貌堂堂。爱因斯坦欣赏闵可夫斯基将数学与物理结合起来的方式，但却避开了他的课上最需要费心思的内容，这就是为什么闵可夫斯基称他为一条懒狗的原因：“他从不为数学操心。”

<p>Among these was Marcel Grossmann, a middle-class Jewish math wizard whose father owned a factory near Zurich. Grossmann took copious notes that he shared with Einstein, who was less diligent about attending lectures. “His notes could have been printed and published,” Einstein later marveled to Grossmann’s wife. “When it came time to prepare for my exams, he would always lend me those notebooks, and they were my savior.

<p>He was also influenced by reading a lesser-known theorist, August Föppl, who in 1894 had written a popular text titled <em>Introduction to Maxwell’s Theory of Electricity.</em> As science historian Gerald Holton has pointed out, Föppl’s book is filled with concepts that would soon echo in Einstein’s work. It has a section on “The Electrodynamics of Moving Conductors” that begins by calling into question the concept of “absolute motion.” The only way to define motion, Föppl notes, is relative to another body. From there he goes on to consider a question concerning the induction of an electric current by a magnetic field: “if it is all the same whether a magnet moves in the vicinity of a resting electric circuit or whether it is the latter that moves while the magnet is <a id="filepos131868"></a>at rest.” Einstein would begin his 1905 special relativity paper by raising this same issue.<sup><a id="filepos131978"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1609073">14</a></sup>

他也受到了一位不太出名的理论家奥古斯特·弗普尔的著作的影响。1894年，弗普尔写出了一部名为《麦克斯韦电学理论导论》（Introduction to Mmaxwell's Throry of Electricity）的通俗著作。正如科学史家霍尔顿所说，弗普尔书中的许多概念很快就在爱因斯坦的工作中派上了用场。书中有一章名为“运动导体的电动力学”，开篇就对“绝对运动”概念提出了质疑。弗普尔指出，运动只能相对于其他物体来定义。然而他进而考虑一个有关磁场感生电流的问题：“到底是电路静止，磁体在附近运动，还是电路运动，磁体静止，这是否是一回事？”在1905年狭义相对论论文的开头，爱因斯坦也提出了同样的问题。

<p>Music continued to beguile Einstein. It was not so much an escape as it was a connection: to the harmony underlying the universe, to the creative genius of the great composers, and to other people who felt comfortable bonding with more than just words. He was awed, both in music and in physics, by the beauty of harmonies.

爱因斯坦欣赏莫扎特和巴赫音乐中清晰的结构，这种结构使他们的音乐似乎是“决定论的”，一如他最喜爱的那些科学理论像是直接来自于宇宙，而不是编创出来的。爱因斯坦曾说：“贝多芬的音乐是创作出来的，而莫扎特的音乐则纯洁非常，似乎向来就存在于宇宙之中。”在另一则报道中，他将贝多芬与巴赫进行对照：“我听贝多芬时感到不舒服。我认为他过于个人化了，几乎是赤裸裸的。还是让我听巴赫，多听些巴赫吧。”

Now, in Zurich, he met a friend of Winteler’s who became a similar political mentor: Gustav Maier, a Jewish banker who had helped arrange Einstein’s first visit to the Polytechnic.

1896年10月，他们双双考入联邦工学院，但关系的推进尚需时日。根据他们的书信或回忆录，种种迹象表明，他们在第一学年还只是同学关系。不过，1897年夏天，他们决定一起去徒步旅行。那年秋天，米列娃从爱因斯坦那里“得到的新感觉让她有些惴惴不安”，她决定暂时离开联邦工学院，去海德堡大学听课。

<p>Her first surviving letter to Einstein, written a few weeks after she moved to Heidelberg, shows glimmers of a romantic attraction but also highlights her self-confident nonchalance. She addresses Einstein with the formal <em>Sie</em> in German, rather than the more intimate <em>du.</em> Unlike Marie Winteler, she teasingly makes the point that she has not been obsessing about him, even though he had written an unusually long letter to her. “It’s now been quite a while since I received your letter,” she said, “and I would have replied immediately and thanked you for the sacrifice of writing four long pages, would have also told of the joy you provided me through our trip together, but you said I should write to you someday when I happened to be bored. And I am very obedient, and I waited and waited for boredom to set in; but so far my waiting has been in vain.”

她给爱因斯坦的现存的第一封信是在到达海德堡后几周写的，它隐隐显示出了爱情的召唤，但她那种自信的冷漠也表现得很突出。她用德语中正式的“您”来称呼爱因斯坦，而没有用更亲切的“你”。与玛丽·温特勒不同，她戏称自己并不迷恋对方，虽然爱因斯坦此前给她写过一封罕见的长信。“收到您的信已经很久了，”她说，“我本想立即回复，以感谢您不辞劳苦写了长长的四页，也表达一下您在旅行中给我带来的快乐。不过您说过，倘使有一天我感到无聊，就该提笔给您写信，而我是很听话的，就一个劲地等待无聊出现；然而时至今日，我的等待仍是枉然。”

<div class="left">
<p>Distinguishing Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> even more from Marie Winteler was the intellectual intensity of her letters. In this first one, she enthused over the lectures she had been attending of Philipp Lenard, then an assistant professor at Heidelberg, on kinetic theory, which explains the properties of gases as being due to the actions of millions of individual molecules. “Oh, it was really neat at the lecture of Professor Lenard yesterday,” she wrote. “He is talking now about the kinetic theory of heat and gases. So, it turns out that the molecules of oxygen move with a velocity of over 400 meters per second, then the good professor calculated and calculated . . . and it finally turned out even though molecules do move with this velocity, they travel a distance of only 1/100 of a hairbreadth.”

米列娃与玛丽的另一点不同是，她在信中表现出了相当的思想力度。在第一封信中，她对菲利普·勒纳德正在讲授的运动论课程表现出了极大热情。勒纳德当时是海德堡大学的副教授，这门课讲的是气体性质如何源于数百万个分子的相互作用。她写道：“哦，昨天勒纳德教授讲的课真是太清楚了。他目前正在讲气体的热运动论，结果竟然得出了氧分子以每秒400多米的速度运动的结论，于是这位可敬的教授算了又算……终于得出这些分子虽然以这种速度在运动，但所走过的路程只是一根头发丝宽度的1/100。”

<p>Kinetic theory had not yet been fully accepted by the scientific establishment (nor, for that matter, had even the existence of atoms and molecules), and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>’s letter indicated that she did not have a deep understanding of the subject. In addition, there was a sad irony: Lenard would be one of Einstein’s early inspirations but later one of his most hateful anti-Semitic tormentors.

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在当时，运动论还没有被科学界广泛接受（甚至原子和分子的存在都没有得到肯定），米列娃的信表明，她对这一领域的了解还不深。顺便说一句，勒纳德将会成为爱因斯坦早期的灵感来源，但后来却成为他最为憎恶的反犹主义者之一。这种讽刺着实令人悲哀。

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> also commented on ideas Einstein had shared in his earlier letter about the difficulty mortals have in comprehending the infinite. “I do not believe that the structure of the human brain is to be blamed <a id="filepos151812"></a>for the fact that man cannot grasp infinity,” she wrote. “Man is very capable of imagining infinite happiness, and he should be able to grasp the infinity of space—I think that should be much easier.” There is a slight echo of Einstein’s escape from the “merely personal” into the safety of scientific thinking: finding it easier to imagine infinite space than infinite happiness.

<p>
针对爱因斯坦在前一封信中提出的人在理解无限方面碰到的困难，米列娃也做了评论。“人不能把握无限，我认为这不应当归咎于人脑的结构，”她写道，“人可以想象无限的幸福，他也应当能够把握空间的无限，我相信这要容易得多。”她发现想象无限空间要比想象无限幸福更容易，这在一定程度上应和了爱因斯坦所说的——摆脱“纯个人事情”的束缚，逃入科学思考的避风港。

<p>Yet Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> was also, it is clear from her letter, thinking of Einstein in a more personal way. She had even talked to her adoring and protective father about him. “Papa gave me some tobacco to take with me and I was supposed to hand it to you personally,” she said. “He wanted so much to whet your appetite for our little land of outlaws. I told him all about you—you must absolutely come back with me someday. The two of you would really have a lot to talk about!” The tobacco, unlike Marie Winteler’s teapot, was a present Einstein would likely have wanted, but Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> teased that she wasn’t sending it.“You would have to pay duty on it, and then you would curse me.”<sup><a id="filepos153102"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1613634">31</a></sup>

不过从信上看，米列娃也在以一种更加个人的方式想念爱因斯坦。她甚至同自己所仰慕的、呵护自己的父亲谈起过他。“我爸爸曾托人捎给我一些烟草，要我一定当面交给您。他很想使您对我们的强盗小国垂涎三尺。我已经向他谈起过您的方方面面。哪天您无论如何都要与我去一次，你们俩一定会有许多东西可谈！”与玛丽的茶壶不同，烟草也许是爱因斯坦钟爱的礼物，不过米列娃却逗他说自己还没有寄出，“不然您必须为它上税，那时您会诅咒我的”。

<p>That conflicting admixture of playfulness and seriousness, of insouciance and intensity, of intimacy and detachment—so peculiar yet also so evident in Einstein as well—must have appealed to him.

<p>Einstein’s mother, who had adored Marie Winteler, was similarly dubious about the dark intellectual who had replaced her. “Your photograph had quite an effect on my old lady,” Einstein wrote from Milan, where he was visiting his parents during spring break of 1899. “While she studied it carefully, I said with the deepest sympathy: ‘Yes, yes, she certainly is a clever one.’ I’ve already had to endure much teasing about this.”<sup><a id="filepos155932"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1614462">35</a></sup>

<p>It is easy to see why Einstein felt such an affinity for Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. They were kindred spirits who perceived themselves as aloof scholars and outsiders.

While on vacation with his family in 1899, Einstein lamented in a letter to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, “When I read Helmholtz for the first time I could not—and still cannot—believe <a id="filepos157747"></a>that I was doing so without you sitting next to me.

<p>Indeed, most of their letters mixed romantic effusions with scientific enthusiasms, often with an emphasis on the latter. In one letter, for example, he foreshadowed not only the title but also some of the concepts of his great paper on special relativity. “I am more and more convinced that the electrodynamics of moving bodies as it is presented today does not correspond to reality and that it will be possible to present it in a simpler way,” he wrote. “The introduction of the term ‘ether’ into theories of electricity has led to the conception of a medium whose motion can be described without, I believe, being able to ascribe physical meaning to it.”<sup><a id="filepos158638"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1614895">37</a></sup>

事实上，他们之间的通信大都既有绵绵爱意，又包含着对科学的巨大热情，而且通常后者更为重要。在一封信中，爱因斯坦不仅预示了他那篇关于狭义相对论的伟大论文的标题，而且预示了其中的某些思想。“我越来越确信，目前这种动体的电动力学是不符合实际的，它能够通过更简单的方式表述出来，”他写道，“在电学理论中引入‘以太’这个术语已经导致了这样一种介质观念，其运动可以被描述，但却无法被赋予物理意义。”

<p>Even though this mix of intellectual and emotional companionship appealed to him, every now and then he recalled the enticement of the simpler desire represented by Marie Winteler. And with the tactlessness that masqueraded for him as honesty (or perhaps because of his puckish desire to torment), he let Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> know it. After his 1899 summer vacation, he decided to take his sister to enroll in school in Aarau, where Marie lived. He wrote Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> to assure her that he would not spend much time with his former girlfriend, but the pledge was written in a way that was, perhaps intentionally, more unsettling than reassuring. “I won’t be going to Aarau as often now that the daughter I was so madly in love with four years ago is coming back home,” he said. “For the most part I feel quite secure in my high fortress of calm.

虽然这种理智与感情并存的伙伴关系令他着迷，但他还是会不时想起玛丽·温特勒所代表的那种更简单欲望的吸引。带着一种他以为是诚实的乖巧（或是为了恶作剧式地折磨别人的欲望）他把事情的原委告诉了米列娃。1899年暑假过后，他决定带着妹妹玛雅报考阿劳中学，而玛丽就住在那里。他写信向米列娃保证，自己绝不会与前女友在一起很长时间。但也许是存心的，这个保证写得非但不能让人宽心，反倒更加令人不安。“我不会常去阿劳，因为我四年前曾经狂恋过的那个女孩儿就要回家去了”他说，“自从有了以内心镇定为基础的坚固堡垒，我通常感觉相当安全。不过我知道，要是再见几次这个姑娘，我肯定会发疯的。我对此相当确信，我怕这件事就像怕火一样。”

There they would be able to “take pleasure in unpacking our memories” of the things they had done together on other hiking trips. “I can already imagine the fun we will have,” he wrote.

<p>To graduate, Einstein had to do a research thesis. He initially proposed to Professor Weber that he do an experiment to measure how fast the earth was moving through the ether, the supposed substance that allowed light waves to propagate through space. The accepted wisdom, which he would famously destroy with his special theory of relativity, was that if the earth were moving through this ether toward or away from the source of a light beam, we’d be able to detect a difference in the observed speed of the light.

为了毕业，爱因斯坦不得不完成一篇研究论文。起初，他向韦伯教授提出用实验来测量地球在以太（使得光波能够在空间中传播的假想的物质）中穿行的速度。根据当时流行的看法（他后来会用狭义相对论推翻它）如果在以太中穿行的地球靠近或远离光源，那么观察到的光速就可以检测出不同。

<p>During his visit to Aarau at the end of his summer vacation of 1899, he worked on this issue with the rector of his old school there. “I had a good idea for investigating the way in which a body’s relative motion with respect to the ether affects the velocity of the propagation of light,” he wrote Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. His idea involved building an apparatus that would use angled mirrors “so that light from a single source would be reflected in two different directions,” sending one part of the beam in the direction of the earth’s movement and the other part of the beam perpendicular to it. In a lecture on how he discovered relativity, Einstein <a id="filepos163554"></a>recalled that his idea was to split a light beam, reflect it in different directions, and see if there was “a difference in energy depending on whether or not the direction was along the earth’s motion through the ether.” This could be done, he posited, by “using two thermoelectric piles to examine the difference of the heat generated in them.”<sup><a id="filepos163942"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1615706">41</a></sup>

1899年暑假，他在造访阿劳期间同母校校长一起研究这个问题。“我想出了一个好办法来研究物体相对于以太的运动是否会影响光的传播速度。”他在给米列娃的信中写道。他认为可以建造这样一个仪器，其中有一些成角度放置的镜面，“使得从一个光源发出的光可以沿两个不同方向被反射”，光的一部分沿着地球运动的方向发送，另一部分则垂直于它发送。后来，在一场关于他如何发现相对论的讲演中，爱因斯坦回忆说，他的想法是将一束光分开，沿不同方向反射它，看看是否会产生“能量差，这取决于该方向是否沿着地球在以太中穿行的方向”。他认为，这一想法可以“用两个热电堆检验它们当中产生的热量差”来实现。

<p>Weber rejected the proposal. What Einstein did not fully realize was that similar experiments had already been done by many others, including the Americans Albert Michelson and Edward Morley, and none had been able to detect any evidence of the perplexing ether—or that the speed of light varied depending on the motion of the observer or the light source. After discussing the topic with Weber, Einstein read a paper delivered the previous year by Wilhelm Wien, which briefly described thirteen experiments that had been conducted to detect the ether, including the Michelson-Morley one.

韦伯反对这一建议。爱因斯坦自己并不知道，其实已经有不少人做过类似的实验（其中也包括美国人阿尔伯特·迈克耳孙和爱德华·莫雷）。没有任何迹象表明，这种令人困惑的以太实际存在着，也没有人发现光速会随着观察者或光源的运动而发生改变。在与韦伯讨论之后，爱因斯坦读到了此前一年威廉·维恩提交的一篇论文，它简要介绍了已有的检测以太的13个实验，其中也包括迈克耳孙-莫雷实验。

<p>Einstein sent Professor Wien his own speculative paper on that topic and asked him to write him back. “He’ll write me via the Polytechnic,” Einstein predicted to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. “If you see a letter there for me, you may go ahead and open it.” There is no evidence that Wien ever wrote back.<sup><a id="filepos165048"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1616015">42</a></sup>

他把自己关于这个问题的纯理论论文寄给了维恩教授，希望他能够回复。“他会通过联邦工学院写信给我，”爱因斯坦向米列娃预言，“您若在那里看到给我的信，可以将它取来启封。”可惜没有证据表明维恩曾经写过回信。

<p>Einstein’s next research proposal involved exploring the link between the ability of different materials to conduct heat and to conduct electricity, something that was suggested by the electron theory. Weber apparently did not like that idea either, so Einstein was reduced, along with Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, to doing a study purely on heat conduction, which was one of Weber’s specialties.

爱因斯坦的下一个计划是研究不同材料的导热性与导电性之间的关联。韦伯显然同样不喜欢这个想法，于是，爱因斯坦不得不（和米列娃一道）完成一项纯粹关于导热性的研究，而这是韦伯最擅长的领域之一。

<p>Einstein later dismissed their graduation research papers as being of “no interest to me.” Weber gave Einstein and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> the two lowest essay grades in the class, a 4.5 and a 4.0, respectively; Grossmann, by comparison, got a 5.5. Adding annoyance to that injury, Weber said that Einstein had not written his on the proper regulation paper, and he forced him to copy the entire essay over again.<sup><a id="filepos166080"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1616444">43</a></sup>

爱因斯坦后来称自己对这篇毕业论文“毫无兴趣”。韦伯给了爱因斯坦和米列娃班上的两个最低分，分别为4.5和4.0，而格罗斯曼则得了5.5。不仅如此，韦伯还说爱因斯坦的论文没有在正规的稿纸上书写，所以强令他将整个文章重抄一遍。

<p>Despite the low mark on his essay, Einstein was able to eke by with a 4.9 average in his final set of grades, placing him fourth in his class of five. Although history refutes the delicious myth that he flunked math in high school, at least it does offer as a consolation the amusement that he graduated college near the bottom of his class.

尽管论文得分很低，但爱因斯坦的毕业总评还是勉强得了4.9分，在班里的五个学生里名列第四。虽然他的中学数学不及格这一动听神话已为历史所颠覆，但有趣的是，他大学毕业时的确在班里是倒数。对有些人来说，这多少也算个安慰吧。

<p><a id="filepos166577"></a>At least he graduated. His 4.9 average was just enough to let him get his diploma, which he did officially in July 1900.

总而言之，爱因斯坦毕业了。他的4.9分刚刚能够拿到毕业文凭，1900年7月，文凭正式下发。然而，米列娃只得了4.0，几乎是班里的最低分，所以无法毕业。她只得来年再试一次。

<p>Not surprisingly, Einstein’s years at the Polytechnic were marked by his pride at casting himself as a nonconformist. “His spirit of independence asserted itself one day in class when the professor mentioned a mild disciplinary measure just taken by the school’s authorities,” a classmate recalled. Einstein protested. The fundamental requirement of education, he felt, was the “need for intellectual freedom.”<sup><a id="filepos167466"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1616996">45</a></sup>

的确，在联邦工学院的那些日子里，爱因斯坦最令人难忘的就是将自己自豪地塑造成一个不服从者。一个同学回忆说，“有一次，他的独立精神在班上表现了出来。教授提到了校方刚刚出台的一条不算严厉的纪律条例”，爱因斯坦表示抗议，他觉得教育最基本的要求是“思想自由”。

<p>Throughout his life, Einstein would speak lovingly of the Zurich Polytechnic, but he also would note that he did not like the discipline that was inherent in the system of examinations. “The hitch in this was, of course, that one had to cram all this stuff into one’s mind for the examinations, whether one liked it or not,” he said. “This coercion had such a deterring effect that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year.”<sup><a id="filepos168116"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1617234">46</a></sup>

爱因斯坦终生都对苏黎世联邦工学院有较高评价，不过他也指出，他并不喜欢由考试制度所带来的纪律。“当然，这里的问题在于，人们为了考试，不论愿意与否，都得把所有这些废物统统塞进自己的脑袋，”他说，“这种强制的结果使我畏缩不前，以至于通过期终考试之后整整一年，我对思考任何科学问题都提不起兴趣。”

<p>In reality, that was neither possible nor true. He was cured within weeks, and he ended up taking with him some science books, including texts by Gustav Kirchhoff and Ludwig Boltzmann, when he joined his mother and sister later that July for their summer holiday in the Swiss Alps. “I’ve been studying a great deal,” he wrote Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, “mainly Kirch-hoff ’s notorious investigations of the motion of the rigid body.” He admitted that his resentment over the exams had already worn off. “My nerves have calmed down enough so that I’m able to work happily again,” he said. “How are yours?”<sup><a id="filepos168909"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1617375">47</a></sup>

实际上，这既不是事实也不可能是事实。他几周之内就打起了精神，最终带着基尔霍夫和玻尔兹曼的教科书等科学书籍，在那年7月底与妈妈、妹妹一起到瑞士的阿尔卑斯山过暑假去了。“我一直在读很多东西，”他在给米列娃的信中说，“特别是基尔霍夫关于刚体运动的那些著名研究。”他承认自己对考试的愤恨已经平息了不少。他说：“我的神经已经镇静下来，因此我又可以幸福地重新开始学习了。你怎么样？”
