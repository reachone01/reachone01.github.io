<p class="calibre29">In the article he wrote for <em class="calibre6">The Times</em> of London after the confirmation of his relativity theory, Einstein quipped that if things went bad the Germans would no longer consider him a compatriot but instead a Swiss Jew. It was a clever remark, made more so because Einstein knew, even then, that there was an odious smell of truth to it. That very week, in a letter to his friend Paul Ehrenfest, he described the mood in Germany. “Anti-Semitism is very strong here,” he wrote. “Where is this all supposed to lead?”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos804090" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1785776" class="calibre22">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The rise of German anti-Semitism after World War I produced a counterreaction in Einstein: it made him identify more strongly with his Jewish heritage and community. At one extreme were German Jews such as Fritz Haber, who did everything they could, including <a id="filepos804448" class="calibre3"></a>converting to Christianity, to assimilate, and they urged Einstein to do the same. But Einstein took the opposite approach. Just when he was becoming famous, he embraced the Zionist cause. He did not officially join any Zionist organization, nor for that matter did he belong to or worship at any synagogue. But he cast his lot in favor of Jewish settlements in Palestine, a national identity among Jews everywhere, and the rejection of assimilationist desires.</p>
<p class="calibre29">He was recruited by the pioneering Zionist leader Kurt Blumenfeld, who paid a call on Einstein in Berlin in early 1919. “With extreme naïveté he asked questions,” Blumenfeld recalled. Among Einstein’s queries: With their spiritual and intellectual gifts, why should Jews be called on to create an agricultural nation-state? Wasn’t nationalism the problem rather than the solution?</p>
<p class="calibre29">Eventually, Einstein came around to the cause. “I am, as a human being, an opponent of nationalism,” he declared. “But as a Jew, I am from today a supporter of the Zionist effort.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos805653" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1785940" class="calibre22">2</a></sup> He also became, more specifically, an advocate for the creation of a new Jewish university in Palestine, which eventually became Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Once he decided to abandon the postulate that all forms of nationalism were bad, he found it easy to embrace Zionism with greater enthusiasm. “One can be an internationalist without being indifferent to members of one’s tribe,” he wrote a friend in October 1919. “The Zionist cause is very close to my heart ...I am glad that there should be a little patch of earth on which our kindred brethren are not considered aliens.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos806370" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786229" class="calibre22">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">His support for Zionism put Einstein at odds with assimilationists. In April 1920, he was invited to address a meeting of one such group that emphasized its members’ loyalty to Germany, the German Citizens of the Jewish Faith. He replied by accusing them of trying to separate themselves from the poorer and less polished eastern European Jews. “Can the ‘Aryan’ respect such pussyfooters?” he chided.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos806903" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786388" class="calibre22">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Privately declining the invitation was not enough. Einstein also felt compelled to write a public attack on those who tried to fit in by talking <a id="filepos807146" class="calibre3"></a>“about religious faith instead of tribal affiliation.”<a id="filepos807219" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_062.html#filepos2416414" class="calibre22">*</a> In particular, he scorned what he called “the assimilatory” approach that sought “to overcome anti-Semitism by dropping nearly everything Jewish.” This never worked; indeed, it “appears somewhat comical to a non-Jew,” because the Jews are a people set apart from others. “The psychological root of anti-Semitism lies in the fact that the Jews are a group of people unto themselves,” he wrote. “Their Jewishness is visible in their physical appearance, and one notices their Jewish heritage in their intellectual work.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos807838" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786582" class="calibre22">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The Jews who practiced and preached assimilation tended to be those who took pride in their German or western European heritage. At the time (and through much of the twentieth century), they tended to look down on Jews from eastern Europe, such as Russia and Poland, who seemed less polished, refined, and assimilated. Although Einstein was German Jewish, he was appalled by those from his background who would “draw a sharp dividing line between eastern European Jews and western European Jews.” The approach was doomed to backfire against all Jews, he argued, and it was not based on any true distinction. “Eastern European Jewry contains a rich potential of human talents and productive forces that can well stand the comparison to the higher civilization of western European Jews.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos808750" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1786799" class="calibre22">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was acutely aware, even more than the assimilationists, that anti-Semitism was not the result of rational causes. “In Germany today hatred of the Jews has taken on horrible expressions,” he wrote in early 1920. Part of the problem was that inflation was out of control. The German mark had been worth about 12 cents at the beginning of 1919, which was half of its value from before the war but still manageable. But by the beginning of 1920, the mark was worth a mere 2 cents, and collapsing further each month.</p>
<p class="calibre29">In addition, the loss of the war had been humiliating. Germany had lost 6 million men and then was forced into surrendering land containing half of its natural resources, plus all of its overseas colonies. Many proud Germans believed it must have been the result of betrayal. The Weimar Republic that had emerged after the war, though supported by liberals and pacifists and Jews such as Einstein, was disdained by much of the old order and even the middle class.</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos809957" class="calibre3"></a>There was one group that could be easily cast as the alien and dark force most responsible for the humiliation facing a proud culture.“People need a scapegoat and make the Jews responsible,” Einstein noted. “They are a target of instinctive resentment because they are of a different tribe.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos810284" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787129" class="calibre22">7</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">Weyland, Lenard, and the Antirelativists</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">The explosion of great art and ideas in Germany at the time, as Amos Elon wrote in his book <em class="calibre6">The Pity of It All,</em> was largely due to Jewish patrons and pioneers in a variety of fields. This was particularly true in science. As Sigmund Freud pointed out, part of the success of Jewish scientists was their “creative skepticism,” which arose from their essential nature as outsiders.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos810934" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787446" class="calibre22">8</a></sup> What the Jewish assimilationists underestimated was the virulence with which many Germans, whom they considered to be their fellow countrymen, in fact saw them as essentially outsiders or, as Einstein put it, “a different tribe.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s first public collision with this anti-Semitism came in the summer of 1920. A shady German nationalist named Paul Weyland, an engineer by training, had turned himself into a polemicist with political aspirations. He was an active member of a right-wing nationalistic political party that pledged, in its 1920 official program, to “diminish the dominant Jewish influence showing up increasingly in government and in public.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos811730" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787576" class="calibre22">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Weyland realized that Einstein, as a highly publicized Jew, had engendered resentment and jealousy. Likewise, his relativity theory was easy to turn into a target, because many people, including some scientists, were unnerved by the way it seemed to undermine absolutes and be built on abstract hypotheses rather than grounded in solid experiment. So Weyland published articles denouncing relativity as “a big hoax” and formed a ragtag (but mysteriously well-funded) organization <a id="filepos812320" class="calibre3"></a>grandly dubbed the Study Group of German Scientists for the Preservation of a Pure Science.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Joining with Weyland was an experimental physicist of modest reputation named Ernst Gehrcke, who for years had been assailing relativity with more vehemence than comprehension. Their group lobbed a few personal attacks at Einstein and the “Jewish nature” of relativity theory, then called a series of meetings around Germany, including a large rally at Berlin’s Philharmonic Hall on August 24.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Weyland spoke first and, with the orotund rhetoric of a demagogue, accused Einstein of engaging in a “businesslike booming of his theory and his name.” Einstein’s penchant for publicity, wanted or not, was being used against him, as his assimilationist friends had warned. Relativity was a hoax, Weyland said, and plagiarized to boot. Gehrcke said much the same with a more technical gloss, reading from a written text. The meeting, reported the <em class="calibre6">New York Times,</em> “had a decidedly antiSemitic complexion.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos813490" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787795" class="calibre22">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">In the middle of Gehrcke’s talk, there arose from the audience a quiet murmur:<em class="calibre6">Einstein, Einstein.</em> He had come to see the circus and, averse neither to publicity nor controversy, laugh at the spectacle. As his friend Philipp Frank noted, “He always liked to regard events in the world around him as if he were a spectator in a theater.” Sitting in the audience with his friend the chemist Walther Nernst, he cackled loudly at times and at the end pronounced the entire event “most amusing.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos814122" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1787956" class="calibre22">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">But he was not truly amused, and he even briefly considered moving away from Berlin.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos814310" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788141" class="calibre22">12</a></sup> His anger aroused, he made the tactical mistake of responding with a highly charged diatribe that was published three days later on the front page of the <em class="calibre6">Berliner Tageblatt,</em> a liberal daily owned by Jewish friends. “I am well aware that the two speakers are unworthy of reply by my pen,” he said, but then proceeded not to be restrained by that awareness. Gehrcke and Weyland had not been explicitly anti-Semitic, nor did they overtly criticize Jews in their speeches. But Einstein alleged that they would not have attacked his theory “if I were a German nationalist, with or without a swastika, instead of a Jew.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos815005" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788562" class="calibre22">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein spent most of his piece refuting Weyland and Gehrcke. <a id="filepos815167" class="calibre3"></a>But he also attacked a more reputable physicist who was not at the meeting but had given support to the antirelativity cause: Philipp Lenard.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize, Lenard had been a pioneer experimenter who described the photoelectric effect. Einstein had once admired him. “I have just read a wonderful paper by Lenard,” Einstein had gushed to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> back in 1901. “Under this beautiful piece I am filled with such happiness and joy that I absolutely must share some of it with you.” After Einstein had published his first spate of seminal papers in 1905, citing Lenard by name in the one on light quanta, the two scientists had exchanged flattering letters.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos815966" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788746" class="calibre22">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">But as an ardent German nationalist, Lenard had become increasingly bitter about the British and the Jews, contemptuous of the publicity Einstein’s theory was garnering, and vocal in his attacks on the “absurd” aspects of relativity. He had allowed his name to be used on brochures that were distributed at Weyland’s meeting, and as a Nobel laureate he had worked behind the scenes to make sure that Einstein was not awarded the prize.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Because Lenard had refrained from showing up at the Philharmonic Hall rally, and because his published critiques of relativity had been academic in tone, Einstein did not need to attack him in his newspaper piece. But he did. “I admire Lenard as a master of experimental physics, but he has not yet produced anything outstanding in theoretical physics, and his objections to the general theory of relativity are of such superficiality that, up until now, I did not think it necessary to answer them,” he wrote. “I intend to make up for this.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos817152" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1788928" class="calibre22">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s friends publicly supported him. A group that included von Laue and Nernst published a letter claiming, not altogether accurately, “Whoever is fortunate enough to be close to Einstein knows that he will never be surpassed in his . . . dislike of all publicity.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos817545" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789112" class="calibre22">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Privately, however, his friends were appalled. He had been provoked into a display of public anger against those who should have remained unworthy of a reply by his pen, thus stirring up even more distasteful publicity. Max Born’s wife, Hedwig, who had freely scolded Einstein about his treatment of his family, now lectured, “[You should] not have allowed yourself to be goaded into that rather unfortunate <a id="filepos818064" class="calibre3"></a>reply.” He should show more respect, she said, for “the secluded temple of science.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos818178" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789251" class="calibre22">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Paul Ehrenfest was even harsher. “My wife and I absolutely cannot believe that you yourself wrote some of the phrases in the article,” he said. “If you really did write them down with your own hand, it proves that these damn pigs have finally succeeded in touching your soul. I urge you as strongly as I can not to throw one more word on this subject to that voracious beast, the public.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos818694" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789411" class="calibre22">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was somewhat contrite. “Don’t be too severe with me,” he replied to the Borns. “Everyone must, from time to time, make a sacrifice on the altar of stupidity, to please the deity and mankind. And I did so thoroughly with my article.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos819069" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789574" class="calibre22">19</a></sup> But he made no apologies for flunking their standards of publicity avoidance. “I had to do this if I wanted to stay in Berlin, where every child recognizes me from photographs,” he told Ehrenfest. “If one believes in democracy, then one must grant the public this much right as well.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos819425" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789742" class="calibre22">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Not surprisingly, Lenard was outraged by Einstein’s article. He insisted on an apology, as he had not even been part of the antirelativity rally. Arnold Sommerfeld, chairman of the German Physical Society, tried to mediate, and he urged Einstein “to write some conciliatory words to Lenard.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos819838" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1789912" class="calibre22">21</a></sup> It was not to be. Einstein refused to back down, and Lenard ended up edging ever closer to being an outright antiSemite and later a Nazi.</p>
<p class="calibre29">(There was one odd coda to this event. In 1953, according to declassified documents in Einstein’s FBI file, a well-dressed German walked into the FBI field office in Miami and told the receptionist he had information that Einstein had admitted to being a communist in an article in <em class="calibre6">Berliner Tageblatt</em> in August 1920. The aspiring informer was none other than Paul Weyland, who had landed in Miami and was trying to emigrate after years of being a con man and swindler all over the world. J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI was eagerly trying to prove, with no success, that Einstein was a communist, and took up the cause. After three months, the Bureau finally found the article and translated it. There was nothing about being a communist in it. Weyland was, nevertheless, granted American citizenship.)<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos820893" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790079" class="calibre22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The public crossfire coming out of the antirelativity rally heightened <a id="filepos821063" class="calibre3"></a>interest in the upcoming annual meeting of German scientists, scheduled for late September in the spa town of Bad Nauheim. Both Einstein and Lenard were to attend, and Einstein had ended his newspaper response by proclaiming that, at his suggestion, a public discussion of relativity would occur there. “Anyone who can dare face a scientific forum can present his objections there,” he said, tossing a gauntlet in Lenard’s direction.</p>
<p class="calibre29">During the weeklong gathering in Bad Nauheim, Einstein stayed with Max Born in Frankfurt, twenty miles away, and the two men commuted to the resort town by train each day. The big showdown over relativity, at which both Einstein and Lenard were expected to participate, was on the afternoon of September 23. Einstein had forgotten to bring anything to write with, so he borrowed the pencil of the person next to him in order to take notes while Lenard talked.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Planck was in the chair, and by both his commanding presence and soothing words he was able to prevent any personal attacks. Lenard’s objections to relativity were similar to those of many nontheorists. The theory was built on equations rather than observations, he said, and it “offends against the simple common sense of a scientist.” Einstein replied that what “seems obvious” changes over time. That was true even of Galileo’s mechanics.</p>
<p class="calibre29">It was the first time that Einstein and Lenard had met, but they did not shake hands or speak to each other. And though the official minutes of the meeting do not record it, Einstein apparently lost his equanimity at one point. “Einstein was provoked into making a caustic reply,” Born recalled. And a few weeks later, Einstein wrote Born to assure him that he would “not allow myself to get excited again as in Nauheim.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos823078" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790237" class="calibre22">23</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Finally, Planck was able to end the session, before any blood was drawn, with a limp joke. “Since the theory of relativity unfortunately has not so far been able to extend the absolute time available for this meeting,” he said, “ it must now be adjourned.”The papers the next day were left without headlines, and the antirelativity movement subsided for the time being.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos823575" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790409" class="calibre22">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">As for Lenard, he distanced himself from the weird group of original antirelativists. “Unfortunately Weyland turned out to be a crook,” <a id="filepos823822" class="calibre3"></a>he later said. But he did not let go of his own antipathy toward Einstein. After the Bad Nauheim meeting he became increasingly vitriolic and anti-Semitic in his attacks on Einstein and “Jewish science.” He became a proponent of creating a “Deutsche Physik” that purged German physics of Jewish influences, which to him was exemplified by Einstein’s relativity theory with its abstract, theoretical, and nonexperimental approach and its odor (at least to him) of a relativism that rejected absolutes, order, and certainties.</p>
<p class="calibre29">A few months later, at the beginning of January 1921, an obscure Munich party functionary picked up the theme. “Science, once our greatest pride, is today being taught by Hebrews,” Adolf Hitler wrote in a newspaper polemic.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos824680" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790582" class="calibre22">25</a></sup> There were even ripples that made it across the Atlantic. That April, the <em class="calibre6">Dearborn Independent,</em> a weekly owned by automaker Henry Ford, a strong anti-Semite, blared a banner headline across the top of its front page. “Is Einstein a Plagiarist?” it accusingly asked.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos825014" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1790787" class="calibre22">26</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">Einstein in America, 1921</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">Albert Einstein’s exploding global fame and budding Zionism came together in the spring of 1921 for an event that was unique in the history of science, and indeed remarkable for any realm: a grand two-month processional through the eastern and midwestern United States that evoked the sort of mass frenzy and press adulation that would thrill a touring rock star. The world had never before seen, and perhaps never will again, such a scientific celebrity superstar, one who also happened to be a gentle icon of humanist values and a living patron saint for Jews.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein had initially thought that his first visit to America might be a way to make some money in a stable currency in order to provide for his family in Switzerland. “I have demanded $15,000 from Princeton and Wisconsin,” he told Ehrenfest.“It will probably scare them off. But if they do bite, I will be buying economic independence for myself—and that’s not a thing to sniff at.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">The American universities did not bite. “My demands were too high,” he reported back to Ehrenfest.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos826462" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791179" class="calibre22">27</a></sup> So by February 1921, he had <a id="filepos826533" class="calibre3"></a>made other plans for the spring: he would present a paper at the third Solvay Conference in Brussels and give some lectures in Leiden at the behest of Ehrenfest.</p>
<p class="calibre29">It was then that Kurt Blumenfeld, leader of the Zionist movement in Germany, came by Einstein’s apartment once again. Exactly two years earlier, Blumenfeld had visited Einstein and enlisted his support for the cause of creating a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Now he was coming with an invitation—or perhaps an instruction—in the form of a telegram from the president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Weizmann was a brilliant biochemist who had emigrated from Russia to England, where he helped his adopted nation in the First World War by coming up with a bacterial method for more efficiently manufacturing the explosive cordite. During that war he worked under former prime minister Arthur Balfour, who was then first lord of the Admiralty. He subsequently helped to persuade Balfour, after he became foreign secretary, to issue the famous 1917 declaration in which Britain pledged to support “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Weizmann’s telegram invited Einstein to accompany him on a trip to America to raise funds to help settle Palestine and, in particular, to create Hebrew University in Jerusalem. When Blumenfeld read it to him, Einstein initially balked. He was not an orator, he said, and the role of simply using his celebrity to draw crowds to the cause was “an unworthy one.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Blumenfeld did not argue. Instead, he simply read Weizmann’s telegram aloud again. “He is the president of our organization,” Blumenfeld said, “and if you take your conversion to Zionism seriously, then I have the right to ask you, in Dr. Weizmann’s name, to go with him to the United States.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">“What you say is right and convincing,” Einstein replied, to the “boundless astonishment” of Blumenfeld. “I realize that I myself am now part of the situation and that I must accept the invitation.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos828949" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791560" class="calibre22">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s reply was indeed a cause for astonishment. He was already committed to the Solvay Conference and other lectures in Europe, he <a id="filepos829191" class="calibre3"></a>professed to dislike the public spotlight, and his fragile stomach had made him reluctant to travel. He was not a faithful Jew, and his allergy to nationalism kept him from being a pure and unalloyed Zionist.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Yet now he was doing something that went against his nature: accepting an implied command from a figure of authority, one that was based on his perceived bonds and commitments to other people. Why?</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s decision reflected a major transformation in his life. Until the completion and confirmation of his general theory of relativity, he had dedicated himself almost totally to science, to the exclusion even of his personal, familial, and societal relationships. But his time in Berlin had made him increasingly aware of his identity as a Jew. His reaction to the pervasive anti-Semitism was to feel even more connected—indeed, inextricably connected—to the culture and community of his people.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Thus in 1921, he made a leap not of faith but of commitment. “I am really doing whatever I can for the brothers of my race who are treated so badly everywhere,” he wrote Maurice Solovine.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos830497" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791702" class="calibre22">29</a></sup> Next to his science, this would become his most important defining connection. As he would note near the end of his life, after declining the presidency of Israel, “My relationship to the Jewish people has become my strongest human tie.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos830794" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1791877" class="calibre22">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">One person who was not only astonished but dismayed by Einstein’s decision was his friend and colleague in Berlin, the chemist Fritz Haber, who had converted from Judaism and assiduously assimilated in order to appear a proper Prussian. Like other assimilationists, he was worried (understandably) that a visit by Einstein to the great wartime enemy at the behest of a Zionist organization would reinforce the belief that Jews had dual loyalties and were not good Germans.</p>
<p class="calibre29">In addition, Haber had been thrilled that Einstein was planning to attend the Solvay Conference in Brussels, the first since the war. No other Germans had been invited, and his attendance was seen as a crucial step for the return of Germany to the larger scientific community.</p>
<p class="calibre29">“People in this country will see this as evidence of the disloyalty of the Jews,” Haber wrote when he heard of Einstein’s decision to visit America. “You will certainly sacrifice the narrow basis upon which the <a id="filepos831996" class="calibre3"></a>existence of professors and students of the Jewish faith at German universities rests.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos832101" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792057" class="calibre22">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Haber apparently had the letter delivered by hand, and Einstein replied the same day. He took issue with Haber’s way of regarding Jews as being people “of the Jewish faith” and instead, once again, cast the identity as being inextricably a matter of ethnic kinship. “Despite my emphatic internationalist beliefs, I have always felt an obligation to stand up for my persecuted and morally oppressed tribal companions,” he said. “The prospect of establishing a Jewish university fills me with particular joy, having recently seen countless instances of perfidious and uncharitable treatment of splendid young Jews with attempts to deny their chances of education.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos832909" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792228" class="calibre22">32</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">And so it was that the Einsteins sailed from Holland on March 21, 1921, for their first visit to America. To keep things unpretentious and inexpensive, Einstein had said he was willing to travel steerage. The request was not granted, and he was given a nice stateroom. He also asked that he and Elsa be given separate rooms, both aboard the ship and at the hotels, so that he could work while on the trip. That request was granted.</p>
<p class="calibre29">It was, by all accounts, a pleasant Atlantic crossing, during which Einstein tried to explain relativity to Weizmann. Asked upon their arrival whether he understood the theory, Weizmann gave a delightful reply: “During the crossing, Einstein explained his theory to me every day, and by the time we arrived I was fully convinced that he really understands it.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos833873" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792399" class="calibre22">33</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">When the ship pulled up to the Battery in lower Manhattan on the afternoon of April 2, Einstein was standing on the deck wearing a faded gray wool coat and a black felt hat that concealed some but not all of his now graying shock of hair. In one hand was a shiny briar pipe; the other clutched a worn violin case. “He looked like an artist,” the <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> reported. “But underneath his shaggy locks was a scientific mind whose deductions have staggered the ablest intellects of Europe.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos834501" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792568" class="calibre22">34</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">As soon as they were permitted, dozens of reporters and cameramen rushed aboard. The press officer of the Zionist organization told <a id="filepos834732" class="calibre3"></a>Einstein that he would have to attend a press conference. “I can’t do that,” he protested. “It’s like undressing in public.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos834904" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792728" class="calibre22">35</a></sup> But he could, of course, and did.</p>
<p class="calibre29">First he obediently followed directions for almost a half hour as the photographers and newsreel men ordered him and Elsa to strike a variety of poses. Then, in the captain’s cabin, he displayed more joy than reluctance as he conducted his first press briefing with all the wit and charm of a merry big-city mayor. “One could tell from his chuckling,” the reporter from the <em class="calibre6">Philadelphia Public Ledger</em> wrote, “that he enjoyed it.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos835510" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1792858" class="calibre22">36</a></sup> His questioners enjoyed it as well. The whole performance, sprinkled with quips and pithy answers, showed why Einstein was destined to become such a wildly popular celebrity.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Speaking through an interpreter, Einstein began with a statement about his hope “to secure the support, both material and moral, of American Jewry for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.” But the reporters were more interested in relativity, and the first questioner requested a one-sentence description of the theory, a request that Einstein would face at almost every stop on his trip. “All of my life I have been trying to get it into one book,” he replied, “and <em class="calibre6">he</em> wants me to get it into one sentence!” Pressed to try, he provided a simple overview: “It is a theory of space and time as far as physics is concerned, which leads to a theory of gravitation.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">What about those, especially in Germany, who attacked his theory? “No one of knowledge opposes my theory,” he answered. “Those physicists who do oppose the theory are animated by political motives.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">What political motives? “Their attitude is largely due to antiSemitism,” he replied.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The interpreter finally called the session to a close. “Well, I hope I have passed my examination,” Einstein concluded with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre29">As they were leaving, Elsa was asked if she understood relativity. “Oh, no, although he has explained it to me many times,” she replied. “But it is not necessary to my happiness.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos837400" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1793030" class="calibre22">37</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Thousands of spectators, along with the fife and drum corps of the Jewish Legion, were waiting in Battery Park when the mayor and other <a id="filepos837635" class="calibre3"></a>dignitaries brought Einstein ashore on a police tugboat. As blue-and-white flags were waved, the crowd sang the <em class="calibre6">Star-Spangled Banner</em> and then the Zionist anthem <em class="calibre6">Hatikvah.</em></p>
<p class="calibre29">The Einsteins and Weizmanns intended to head directly to the Hotel Commodore in Midtown. Instead, their motorcade wound through the Jewish neighborhoods of the Lower East Side late into the evening. “Every car had its horn, and every horn was put in action,” Weizmann recalled. “We reached the Commodore at about 11:30, tired, hungry, thirsty and completely dazed.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos838281" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1793328" class="calibre22">38</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The following day Einstein entertained a steady procession of visitors and, with what the <em class="calibre6">Times</em> called “an unusual impression of geniality,” he even held another press gathering. Why, he was asked, had he attracted such an unprecedented explosion of public interest? He professed to being puzzled himself. Perhaps a psychologist could determine why people who generally did not care for science had taken such an interest in him. “It seems psycho-pathological,” he said with a laugh.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos838901" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1793463" class="calibre22">39</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Weizmann and Einstein were officially welcomed later in the week at City Hall, where ten thousand excited spectators gathered in the park to hear the speeches. Weizmann got polite applause. But Einstein, who said nothing, got a “tumultuous greeting” when he was introduced. “As Dr. Einstein left,” the New York <em class="calibre6">Evening Post</em> reported, “he was lifted onto the shoulders of his colleagues and into the automobile, which passed in triumphal procession through a mass of waving banners and a roar of cheering voices.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos839562" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1793673" class="calibre22">40</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">One of Einstein’s visitors at the Commodore Hotel was a German immigrant physician named Max Talmey, whose name had been Max Talmud back when he was a poor student in Munich. This was the family friend who had first exposed the young Einstein to math and philosophy, and he was unsure whether the now famous scientist would remember him.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein did. “He had not seen me or corresponded with me for nineteen years,” Talmey later noted. “Yet as soon as I entered his room in the hotel, he exclaimed: ‘You distinguish yourself through eternal youth!’ ”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos840315" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1793892" class="calibre22">41</a></sup> They chatted about their days in Munich and their paths since. Einstein invited Talmey back various times during the course of <a id="filepos840485" class="calibre3"></a>his visit, and before he left even went to Talmey’s apartment to meet his young daughters.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Even though he spoke in German about abstruse theories or stood silent as Weizmann tried to cajole money for Jewish settlements in Palestine, Einstein drew packed crowds wherever he went in New York.“Every seat in the Metropolitan Opera House, from the pit to the last row under the roof, was filled, and hundreds stood,” reported the <em class="calibre6">Times</em> one day. About another lecture that week it likewise reported, “He spoke in German, but those anxious to see and hear the man who has contributed a new theory of space and time and motion to scientific conceptions of the universe filled every seat and stood in the aisles.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos841297" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1794025" class="calibre22">42</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">After three weeks of lectures and receptions in New York, Einstein paid a visit to Washington. For reasons fathomable only by those who live in that capital, the Senate decided to debate the theory of relativity. Among the leaders asserting that it was incomprehensible were Pennsylvania Republican Boies Penrose, famous for once uttering that “public office is the last refuge of a scoundrel,” and Mississippi Democrat John Sharp Williams, who retired a year later, saying, “I’d rather be a dog and bay at the moon than stay in the Senate another six years.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">On the House side of the Capitol, Representative J. J. Kindred of New York proposed placing an explanation of Einstein’s theories in the <em class="calibre6">Congressional Record.</em> David Walsh of Massachusetts rose to object. Did Kindred understand the theory? “I have been earnestly busy with this theory for three weeks,” he replied, “and am beginning to see some light.” But what relevance, he was asked, did it have to the business of Congress? “It may bear upon the legislation of the future as to general relations with the cosmos.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Such discourse made it inevitable that, when Einstein went with a group to the White House on April 25, President Warren G. Harding would be faced with the question of whether <em class="calibre6">he</em> understood relativity. As the group posed for cameras, President Harding smiled and confessed that he did not comprehend the theory at all. The <em class="calibre6">Washington Post</em> carried a cartoon showing him puzzling over a paper titled “Theory of Relativity” while Einstein puzzled over one on the “Theory of Normalcy,” which was the name Harding gave to his governing philosophy <a id="filepos843250" class="calibre3"></a>. The <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> ran a page 1 headline: “Einstein Idea Puzzles Harding, He Admits.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">At a reception in the National Academy of Sciences on Constitution Avenue (which now boasts the world’s most interesting statue of Einstein, a twelve-foot-high full-length bronze figure of him reclining),<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos843637" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1794193" class="calibre22">43</a></sup> he listened to long speeches from various honorees, including Prince Albert I of Monaco, who was an avid oceanographer, a North Carolina scholar of hookworms, and a man who had invented a solar stove. As the evening droned on, Einstein turned to a Dutch diplomat seated next to him and said, “I’ve just developed a new theory of eternity.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos844042" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1795041" class="calibre22">44</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">By the time Einstein reached Chicago, where he gave three lectures and played violin at a dinner party, he had become more adept at answering irksome questions, particularly the most frequent one, which was sparked by the fanciful <em class="calibre6">New York Times</em> headline after the 1919 eclipse that only twelve people could understand his theory.</p>
<p class="calibre29">“Is it true only twelve great minds can understand your theory?” the reporter from the <em class="calibre6">Chicago Herald and Examiner</em> asked.</p>
<p class="calibre29">“No, no,” Einstein replied with a smile. “I think the majority of scientists who have studied it can understand it.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">He then proceeded to try to explain it to the reporter by using his metaphor about how the universe would look to a two-dimensional creature who spent its life moving on a surface of what turned out to be a globe. “It could travel for millions of years and would always return to its starting point,” said Einstein. “It would never be conscious of what was above it or beneath it.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">The reporter, being a good Chicago newspaperman, was able to spin a glorious tale, written in the third person, about the depths of his own confusion. “When the reporter came to he was vainly trying to light a three-dimensional cigarette with a three-dimensional match,” the story concluded. “It began to trickle into his brain that the two-dimensional organism referred to was himself, and far from being the 13th Great Mind to comprehend the theory he was condemned henceforth to be one of the Vast Majority who live on Main Street and ride in Fords.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos845977" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1795375" class="calibre22">45</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">When a reporter from the rival <em class="calibre6">Tribune</em> asked him the same question <a id="filepos846152" class="calibre3"></a>about only twelve people being able to understand his theory, Einstein again denied it. “Everywhere I go, someone asks me that question,” he said. “It’s absurd. Anyone who has had sufficient training in science can readily understand the theory.” But this time Einstein made no attempt to explain it, nor did the reporter. “The <em class="calibre6">Tribune</em> regrets to inform its readers that it will be unable to present to them Einstein’s theory of relativity,” the article began. “After the professor explained that the most incidental discussion of the question would take from three to four hours, it was decided to confine the interview to other things.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos846871" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1795675" class="calibre22">46</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein went on to Princeton, where he delivered a weeklong series of scientific lectures and received an honorary degree “for voyaging through strange seas of thought.” Not only did he get a nice fee for the lectures (though apparently not the $15,000 he had originally sought), he also negotiated a deal while there that Princeton could publish his lectures as a book from which he would get a 15 percent royalty.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos847403" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1795841" class="calibre22">47</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">At the behest of Princeton’s president, all of Einstein’s lectures were very technical. They included more than 125 complex equations that he scribbled on the blackboard while speaking in German. As one student admitted to a reporter, “I sat in the balcony, but he talked right over my head anyway.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos847830" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1796251" class="calibre22">48</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">At a party following one of these lectures, Einstein uttered one of his most memorable and self-revealing quotes. Someone excitedly informed him that word had just arrived of a new set of experiments improving on the Michelson-Morley technique that seemed to show that the ether existed and the speed of light was variable. Einstein simply refused to accept it. He knew that his theory was correct. And so he calmly responded, “Subtle is the Lord, but malicious he is not.”<a id="filepos848414" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_063.html#filepos2416844" class="calibre22">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre29">The mathematics professor Oswald Veblen, who was standing there, heard the remark and, when a new math building was built a decade later, asked Einstein for the right to carve the words on the stone mantel of the fireplace in the common room. Einstein happily sent back his approval and further explained to Veblen what he had meant: “Nature hides her secret because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of ruse.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos848944" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1796426" class="calibre22">49</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos849043" class="calibre3"></a>The building, neatly enough, later became the temporary home of the Institute for Advanced Study, and Einstein would have an office there when he immigrated to Princeton in 1933. Near the end of his life, he was in front of the fireplace at a retirement party for the mathematician Hermann Weyl, a friend who had followed him from Germany to Princeton when the Nazis took power. Alluding to his frustration with the uncertainties of quantum mechanics, Einstein nodded to the quote and lamented to Weyl, “Who knows, perhaps He <em class="calibre6">is</em> a little malicious.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos849625" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797041" class="calibre22">50</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein seemed to like Princeton. “Young and fresh,” he called it. “A pipe as yet unsmoked.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos849846" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797209" class="calibre22">51</a></sup> For a man who was invariably fondling new briar pipes, this was a compliment. It would not be a surprise, a dozen years hence, that he would decide to move there permanently.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Harvard, where Einstein went next, did not endear itself quite as well. Perhaps it was because Princeton President John Hibben had introduced him in German, whereas Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell spoke to him in French. In addition, Harvard had invited Einstein to visit, but it did not invite him to give lectures.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Some charged that this slight was due to the influence of a rival Zionist group in America led by Louis Brandeis, a graduate of Harvard Law School, who had become the first Jewish Supreme Court justice. The allegation was so widespread that Brandeis’s protégé Felix Frankfurter had to issue a public denial. That prompted an amused letter about the perils of assimilationism from Einstein to Frankfurter. It was “a Jewish weakness,” he wrote, “always and eagerly to try to keep the Gentiles in good humor.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos851049" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797370" class="calibre22">52</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The very assimilated Brandeis, who had been born in Kentucky and had turned himself into a proper Bostonian, was an example of the Jews from Germany whose families had arrived in the nineteenth century and tended to look down on the more recent immigrants from eastern Europe and Russia. For both political and personal reasons, Brandeis had clashed with Weizmann, a Russian Jew who had a more assertive and political approach toward Zionism.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos851595" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797547" class="calibre22">53</a></sup> The enthusiastic crowds that greeted Einstein and Weizmann on their trip were mainly <a id="filepos851723" class="calibre3"></a>made up of the eastern European Jews, while Brandeis and his ilk remained more aloof.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Most of Einstein’s time during the two days he spent in Boston was devoted to appearances, rallies, and dinners (including a kosher banquet for five hundred) with Weizmann to drum up contributions for their Zionist cause. The <em class="calibre6">Boston Herald</em> reported on the reaction at one fund-raising event at a synagogue in Roxbury:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre38"><p class="calibre21">The response was electrifying. Young girl ushers worked their way with difficulty through the crowded aisles, carrying long boxes. Bills of various denominations were rained into these receptacles. A prominent Jewess cried out ecstatically that she had eight sons who had been in the army and wanted to make some donation in proportion to their sacrifices. She held up her watch, a valuable imported timepiece, and slipped the rings from her hands. Others followed her example, and soon baskets and boxes filled with diamonds and other precious ornaments.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos852845" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797795" class="calibre22">54</a></sup></p></blockquote><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">While in Boston, Einstein was subjected to a pop quiz known as the Edison test. The inventor Thomas Edison was a practical man, getting crankier with age (he was then 74), who disparaged American colleges as too theoretical and felt the same about Einstein. He had devised a test he gave job applicants that, depending on the position being sought, included about 150 factual questions. How is leather tanned? What country consumes the most tea? What was Gutenberg’s type made of?<a id="filepos853443" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_064.html#filepos2417144" class="calibre22">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre29">The <em class="calibre6">Times</em> called it “the ever-present Edison questionnaire controversy,” and of course Einstein ran into it. A reporter asked him a question from the test. “What is the speed of sound?” If anyone understood the propagation of sound waves, it was Einstein. But he admitted that he did not “carry such information in my mind since it is readily available in books.” Then he made a larger point designed to disparage Edison’s view of education. “The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think,” he said.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos854161" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1797954" class="calibre22">55</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">One remarkable feature of most stops on Einstein’s grand tour was a noisy parade, which was rather unusual for a theoretical physicist. In Hartford, Connecticut, for example, the procession included more than a hundred automobiles headed by a band, a coterie of war veterans, and standard-bearers with the American and Zionist flags. More than fifteen thousand spectators lined the route. “North Main Street was jammed by crowds that struggled to get close to shake hands,” the newspaper reported. “The crowds cheered wildly as Dr. Weizmann and Prof. Einstein stood up in the car to receive flowers.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos854895" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798167" class="calibre22">56</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos854994" class="calibre3"></a>It was an astonishing scene, but it was exceeded in Cleveland. Several thousands thronged Union train depot to meet the visiting delegation, and the parade included two hundred honking and flag-draped cars. Einstein and Weizmann rode in an open car, preceded by a National Guard marching band and a cadre of Jewish war veterans in uniform. Admirers along the way grabbed on to Einstein’s car and jumped on the running board, while police tried to pull them away.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos855474" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798403" class="calibre22">57</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">While in Cleveland, Einstein spoke at the Case School of Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve), where the famous Michelson-Morley experiments had been conducted. There he met privately, for more than an hour, with Professor Dayton Miller, whose new version of that experiment had provoked Einstein’s skeptical response at the Princeton cocktail party. Einstein drew sketches of Miller’s ether-drift models and urged him to continue refining his experiments. Miller remained dubious about relativity and partial to the ether, but other experiments eventually affirmed Einstein’s faith that the Lord was indeed more subtle than malicious.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos856237" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798564" class="calibre22">58</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The excitement, public outpouring, and dizzying superstar status conferred upon Einstein were unprecedented. But in financial terms, the tour was only a modest success for the Zionist movement. The poorer Jews and recent immigrants had poured out to see him and donated with enthusiasm. But few of the eminent and old-line Jews with great personal fortunes became part of the frenzy. They were, on the whole, more assimilated and less ardently Zionist. Weizmann had hoped to raise at least $4 million. By the end of the year, only $750,000 had actually been collected.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos856909" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798695" class="calibre22">59</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Even after his trip to America, Einstein did not become a full-fledged member of the Zionist movement. He supported the general <a id="filepos857136" class="calibre3"></a>idea of Jewish settlements in Palestine, and especially Hebrew University in Jerusalem, but he never had a desire to relocate there himself nor to press for the creation of a Jewish nation-state. Instead, his connection was more visceral. He came to feel even more associated with the Jewish people, and he resented even more those who would forsake their roots in order to assimilate.</p>
<p class="calibre29">In this regard, he was part of a momentous trend that was reshaping Jewish identity, by choice and by imposition, in Europe. “Until a generation ago, Jews in Germany did not consider themselves as members of the Jewish people,” he told a reporter on the day he was leaving America. “They merely considered themselves as members of a religious community.” But anti-Semitism changed that, and there was a silver lining to that cloud, he thought. “The undignified mania of trying to adapt and conform and assimilate, which happens among many of my social standing, has always been very repulsive to me,” he said.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos858235" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1798833" class="calibre22">60</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">The Bad German</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s trip to America indelibly cast him as he wanted to be: a citizen of the world, an internationalist, not a German. That image was reinforced by his trips to Germany’s other two Great War enemies. On a visit to England, he spoke at the Royal Society and laid flowers on the grave of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey. In France, he charmed the public by lecturing in French and taking a mournful tour of the graves on the famous battlefields.</p>
<p class="calibre29">It was also a time of reconciliation with his family. That summer of 1921, he vacationed on the Baltic with his two boys, instilled in young Eduard a love of math, and then took Hans Albert to Florence. They had such a pleasant time that it helped further restore his relations with Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>. “I’m grateful that you’ve raised them to have a friendly regard for me,” he wrote her. “In fact you’ve done an exemplary job all around.” Most astonishingly, on his way home from Italy he visited Zurich and not only called on Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> but even considered staying in “the little upstairs room,” as he called it, at her house there. They all got together with the Hurwitz family and had a musical evening as in the old days.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos859821" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1799096" class="calibre22">61</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos859920" class="calibre3"></a>But the mood was soon sullied by the continued collapse of the German mark, which made it harder for Einstein to support a family whose consumption was in Swiss currency. Before the war the mark had been worth 24 cents, but it had fallen to 2 cents by the beginning of 1920. At that time a mark could buy a loaf of bread. But then the bottom fell out of the currency. By the beginning of 1923, the price of a loaf went to 700 marks and by the end of that year cost 1 billion marks. Yes, 1 billion. In November 1923, a new currency, the Rentenmark, was introduced, backed by the government property; 1 trillion old marks equaled 1 new Rentenmark.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The German people increasingly cast around for scapegoats. They blamed internationalists and pacifists who had forced a surrender in the war. They blamed the French and English for imposing what was in fact an onerous peace. And, no surprise, they blamed the Jews. So Germany in the 1920s was not a good place or time to be an internationalist, pacifist, intellectual Jew.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The milestone that marked the passage of German anti-Semitism from being a nasty undercurrent to a public danger was the assassination of Walther Rathenau. From a wealthy Jewish family in Berlin (his father founded AEG, an electricity firm that competed with that of Einstein’s father and then became a huge corporation), he served as a senior official in the war ministry, then reconstruction minister and finally foreign minister.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein had read Rathenau’s politics book in 1917, and over dinner told him, “I saw with astonishment and joy how extensive a meeting of minds there is between our outlooks on life.” Rathenau returned the compliment by reading Einstein’s popular explanation of relativity. “I do not say it comes easily to me, but certainly relatively easily,” he joked. Then he peppered Einstein with some very insightful questions: “How does a gyroscope know that it is rotating? How does it distinguish the direction in space toward which it does not want to be tilted?”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos862163" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1799530" class="calibre22">62</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Although they became close friends, there was one issue that divided them. Rathenau opposed Zionism and thought, mistakenly, that Jews like himself could reduce anti-Semitism by thoroughly assimilating as good Germans.</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos862537" class="calibre3"></a>In the hope that Rathenau could warm to the Zionist cause, Einstein introduced him to Weizmann and Blumenfeld. They met for discussions, both at Einstein’s apartment and at Rathenau’s grand manor in Berlin’s Grunewald, but Rathenau remained unmoved.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos862816" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1799738" class="calibre22">63</a></sup> The best course, he thought, was for Jews to take public roles and become part of Germany’s power structure.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Blumenfeld argued that it was wrong for a Jew to presume to run the foreign affairs of another people, but Rathenau kept insisting that he was a German. It was an attitude that was “all too typical of assimilated German Jews,” said Weizmann, who was contemptuous of German Jews who tried to assimilate, and especially of those courtiers who became what he dismissed as <em class="calibre6">Kaiserjuden.</em> “They seemed to have no idea that they were sitting on a volcano.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos863516" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1799964" class="calibre22">64</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">As foreign minister in 1922, Rathenau supported German compliance with the Treaty of Versailles and negotiated the Treaty of Rappallo with the Soviet Union, which caused him to be among the first to be labeled by the fledgling Nazi Party as a member of a Jewish-communist conspiracy. On the morning of June 24, 1922, some young nationalists pulled alongside the open car in which Rathenau was riding to work, sprayed him with machine-gun fire, lobbed in a hand grenade, and then sped away.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was devastated by the brutal assassination, and most of Germany mourned. Schools, universities, and theaters were closed out of respect on the day of his funeral. A million people, Einstein included, paid tribute in front of the Parliament building.</p>
<p class="calibre29">But not everyone felt sympathy. Adolf Hitler called the killers German heroes. Likewise, at the University of Heidelberg, Einstein’s antagonist Philipp Lenard decided to defy the day of mourning and give his regular lecture. A number of students showed up to cheer him, but a group of passing workers were so enraged that they dragged the professor from the class and were about to drop him in the Neckar River when police intervened.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos864921" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1800110" class="calibre22">65</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">For Einstein, the assassination of Rathenau provided a bitter lesson: assimilation did not bring safety. “I regretted the fact that he became a government minister,” Einstein wrote in a tribute he sent to a German magazine. “In view of the attitude that large numbers of educated <a id="filepos865318" class="calibre3"></a>Germans have towards Jews, I have always thought that the proper conduct of the Jews in public life should be one of proud reserve.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos865468" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1800247" class="calibre22">66</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Police warned Einstein that he might be next. His name appeared on the target lists prepared by Nazi sympathizers. He should leave Berlin, officials said, or at least avoid any public lectures.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein moved temporarily to Kiel, took a leave of absence from his teaching duties, and wrote to Planck, backing out of the speech he was scheduled to give to the annual convention of German scientists. Lenard and Gehrcke had led a group of nineteen scientists who published a “Declaration of Protest” aimed at barring him from that convention, and Einstein realized that his fame had come back to haunt him. “The newspapers have mentioned my name too often, thus mobilizing the rabble against me,” he explained in his note of apology to Planck.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos866393" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1800380" class="calibre22">67</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The months after Rathenau’s assassination were “nerve-wracking,” Einstein lamented to his friend Maurice Solovine. “I am always on the alert.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos866669" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1800628" class="calibre22">68</a></sup> To Marie Curie he confided that he would probably quit his positions in Berlin and find someplace else to live. She urged him to stay and fight instead: “I think that your friend Rathenau would have encouraged you to make an effort.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos866962" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1800805" class="calibre22">69</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">One option he considered briefly was a move to Kiel, on Germany’s Baltic coast, to work at an engineering firm there run by a friend. He had already developed for the firm a new design for a navigational gyroscope, which it patented in 1922 and for which he was paid 20,000 marks in cash.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The firm’s owner was surprised but thrilled when Einstein suggested that he might be willing to move there, buy a villa, and become an engineer rather than a theoretical physicist. “The prospect of a downright normal human existence in quietude, combined with the welcome chance of practical work in the factory, delights me,” Einstein said. “Plus the wonderful scenery, sailing—enviable!”</p>
<p class="calibre29">But he quickly abandoned the idea, blaming it on Elsa’s “horror” of any change. Elsa, for her part, pointed out, no doubt correctly, that it was really Einstein’s own decision.“This business of quietude is an illusion,” she wrote.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos868165" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801034" class="calibre22">70</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos868264" class="calibre3"></a>Why didn’t he leave Berlin? He had lived there for eight years, longer than anywhere since running away from Munich as a schoolboy. Anti-Semitism was rising, the economy collapsing, and Kiel was certainly not his only option. The light from his star was causing his friends in both Leiden and Zurich to try repeatedly to recruit him with lucrative job offers.</p>
<p class="calibre29">His inertia is hard to explain, but it is indicative of a change that became evident in both his personal life and his scientific work during the 1920s. He had once been a restless rebel who hopped from job to job, insight to insight, resisting anything that smacked of restraint. He had been repelled by conventional respectability. But now he personified it. From being a romantic youth who fancied himself a footloose bohemian he had settled, with but a few stabs at ironic detachment, into a bourgeois life with a doting hausfrau and a richly wallpapered home filled with heavy Biedermeier furniture. He was no longer restless. He was comfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Despite his qualms about publicity and resolve to lie low, it was not in Einstein’s nature to shy away from saying what he thought. Nor was he always able to resist demands that he play a public role. Thus he showed up at a huge pacifist rally in a Berlin public park on August 1, just five weeks after Rathenau’s assassination. Although he did not speak, he agreed to be paraded around the rally in a car.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos869824" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801173" class="calibre22">71</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Earlier that year, he had joined the League of Nations’ International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which sought to promote a pacifist spirit among scholars, and he had persuaded Marie Curie to join as well. Its name and mission was sure to inflame German nationalists. So in the wake of the Rathenau assassination, Einstein declared that he wished to resign. “The situation here is that a Jew would do well to exercise restraint as regards his participation in political affairs,” he wrote a League official. “In addition, I must say that I have no desire to represent people who would certainly not choose me as their representative.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos870603" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801316" class="calibre22">72</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Even that small act of public reticence did not hold. Curie and the Oxford professor Gilbert Murray, a leader of the committee, begged him to stay a member, and Einstein promptly withdrew his resignation. For the next two years, he remained peripherally involved, but <a id="filepos870970" class="calibre3"></a>eventually he broke with the League, partly because it supported France’s seizure of the Ruhr region after Germany was unable to make reparation payments.</p>
<p class="calibre29">He treated the League, as he did so many parts of life, with a slightly detached and amused air. Each member was supposed to give an address to Geneva University students, but Einstein gave a violin recital instead. One evening at a dinner, Murray’s wife asked him why he remained so cheerful given the depravity of the world. “We must remember that this is a very small star,” he responded, “and probably some of the larger and more important stars may be very virtuous and happy.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos871711" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801609" class="calibre22">73</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">Asia and Palestine, 1922–1923</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">The unpleasant atmosphere in Germany made Einstein willing to take the most extensive tour of his life, a six-month excursion beginning in October 1922 that would be the only time he would travel either to Asia or what is now Israel. Wherever he went, he was treated as a celebrity, arousing within him the usual mixed emotions. Upon arrival in Ceylon, the Einsteins were whisked away by a waiting rickshaw.“We rode in small one-man carriages drawn at a trot by men of Herculean strength yet delicate build,” he noted in his travel diary. “I was bitterly ashamed to share responsibility for the abominable treatment accorded fellow human beings but was unable to do anything about it.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos872666" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1801752" class="calibre22">74</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">In Singapore, almost the entire Jewish community of more than six hundred turned up at the dock, fortunately trailing no rickshaws. Einstein’s target was the richest of them all, Sir Menasseh Meyer, who was born in Baghdad and made his fortune in the opium and real estate markets. “Our sons are refused admission to the universities of other nations,” he declared in his speech seeking donations for Hebrew University. Not many of his listeners understood German, and Einstein called the event a “desperate calamity of language with good tasting cake.” But it paid off. Meyer gave a sizable donation.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos873401" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1802024" class="calibre22">75</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s own take was even greater. His Japanese publisher and hosts paid him 2,000 pounds for his lecture series there. It was a huge success. Close to twenty-five hundred paying customers showed up for <a id="filepos873712" class="calibre3"></a>the first talk in Tokyo, which lasted four hours with translation, and more thronged the Imperial Palace to watch his arrival there to meet the emperor and empress.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was typically amused by it all. “No living person deserves this sort of reception,” he told Elsa as they stood on the balcony of their hotel room at dawn listening to the cheers of a thousand people who had kept an all-night vigil hoping to glimpse him. “I’m afraid we’re swindlers. We’ll end up in prison yet.” The German ambassador, with a bit of edge to his pen, reported that “the entire journey of the famous man has been mounted and executed as a commercial enterprise.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos874484" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1802255" class="calibre22">76</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Feeling sorry for his listeners, Einstein shortened his subsequent lecture to under three hours. But as he rode to the next city by train (passing along the way through Hiroshima), he could sense that something was amiss with his hosts. Upon asking what the problem was, he was politely told, “The persons who arranged the second lecture were insulted because it did not last four hours like the first one.” Thenceforth, he lectured long to the patient Japanese audiences.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The Japanese people struck him as gentle and unpretentious, with a deep appreciation for beauty and ideas. “Of all the people I have met, I like the Japanese most, as they are modest, intelligent, considerate, and have a feel for art,” he wrote his two sons.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos875399" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1802440" class="calibre22">77</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">On his voyage back west, Einstein made his only visit to Palestine, a memorable twelve-day stay that included stops in Lod, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa. He was greeted with great British pomp, as if he were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist. A cannon salute announced his arrival at the palatial residence of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein, on the other hand, was typically unpretentious; he and Elsa arrived tired because he had insisted that they travel in the coach-class car of the overnight train from the coast rather than the first-class sleeping car that had been prepared for them. Elsa was so unnerved by the British formality that she went to bed early some nights to avoid ceremonial events. “When my husband commits a breach of etiquette, it is said it’s because he’s a man of genius,” she complained. “In my case, however, it is attributed to lack of culture.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos876519" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1802632" class="calibre22">78</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Like Lord Haldane, Commissioner Samuel was a serious amateur <a id="filepos876679" class="calibre3"></a>in philosophy and science. Together he and Einstein walked the Old City of Jerusalem to that holiest shrine for religious Jews, the Western Wall (or Wailing Wall) that flanks Temple Mount. But Einstein’s deepening love for his Jewish heritage did not instill any new appreciation for the Jewish religion. “Dull-minded tribal companions are praying, faces turned to the wall, rocking their bodies forward and back,” he recorded in his diary. “A pitiful sight of men with a past but without a future.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos877220" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1802769" class="calibre22">79</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The sights of industrious Jewish people building a new land evinced a more positive reaction. One day he went to a reception for a Zionist organization, and the gates of the building were stormed by throngs who wanted to hear him.“I consider this the greatest day of my life,” Einstein proclaimed in the excitement of the moment. “Before, I have always found something to regret in the Jewish soul, and that is the forgetfulness of its own people. Today, I have been made happy by the sight of the Jewish people learning to recognize themselves and to make themselves recognized as a force in the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">The most frequent question Einstein was asked was whether he would someday return to Jerusalem to stay. He was unusually discreet in his replies, saying nothing quotable. But he knew, as he confided to one of his hosts, that if he came back he would be “an ornament” with no chance of peace or privacy. As he noted in his diary, “My heart says yes, but my reason says no.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos878405" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1802962" class="calibre22">80</a></sup></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_51"></div></body>
