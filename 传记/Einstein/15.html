As a self-assured 17-year-old, Einstein had enrolled at the Zurich Polytechnic and met Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, the woman he would marry. Now, in October 1909, at age 30, he was returning to that city to take up his post as a junior professor at the nearby University of Zurich.

爱因斯坦17岁时，满怀信心地考取了苏黎世联邦工学院，见到了他未来的妻子米列娃。时光荏苒，1909年10月，爱因斯坦已是而立之年，他又回到了这个城市，在与联邦工学院毗邻的苏黎世大学任副教授。

Their homecoming restored, at least temporarily, some of the romance to their relationship. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> was thrilled to be back in their original nesting ground, and by the end of their first month there she became pregnant again.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
这次返乡至少暂时使他们的关系有所恢复。米列娃对重返最初的爱巢兴奋异常。一个月后，她又一次怀孕了。

The apartment they rented was in a building where, they happily discovered, Friedrich Adler and his wife lived, and the couples became even closer friends. “They run a bohemian household,” Adler wrote his father approvingly. “The more I talk to Einstein, the more I realize that my favorable opinion of him was justified.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
他们惊喜地发现，阿德勒夫妇也住在他们这座公寓大楼里。现在，这两对夫妇走得更近了。“他们都不拘于传统，”阿德勒带着赞许给父亲写信说，“通过与爱因斯坦深入交谈，我越来越认识到我对他的好评是公正的。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

<p>

The two men discussed physics and philosophy most evenings, often retreating to the attic of the three-story building so they would not be disturbed by children or spouses. Adler introduced Einstein to the work of Pierre Duhem, whose 1906 book <em>La Théorie Physique</em> Adler had just published in German. Duhem offered a more holistic approach than Mach did to the relationship between theories and experimental evidence, one that seemed to influence Einstein as he staked out his own philosophy of science.<sup><a id="filepos469217"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697633">1</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
到了晚上，爱因斯坦与阿德勒经常在一起讨论物理学和哲学。为了不受孩子或配偶打扰，他们往往会去这座三层建筑的顶楼讨论。阿德勒向爱因斯坦介绍了皮埃尔·迪昂的著作，他已经将迪昂的《物理学理论的目的与结构》（La Théorie Phy-sique, son objet et sa structure）翻译成了德文。针对理论与实验证据之间的关系，迪昂提出的观点比马赫更具整体论色彩。这种观点似乎影响了爱因斯坦的科学哲学。 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos469315"></a>Adler particularly respected Einstein’s “most independent” mind. There was, he told his father, a nonconformist streak in Einstein that reflected an inner security but not an arrogance. “We find ourselves in agreement on questions that the majority of physicists would not even understand,” Adler boasted.<sup><a id="filepos469662"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697863">2</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
阿德勒特别佩服爱因斯坦独立思考的能力。他告诉父亲，爱因斯坦有一种不受他人所左右的品质，反映出内心的自信而非傲慢。“我们就许多物理学家甚至无法理解的一些问题取得了共识。”阿德勒自豪地说。 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein tried to persuade Adler to focus on science rather than be enticed into politics. “Be a little patient,” he said. “You will certainly be my successor in Zurich one day.” (Einstein was already assuming that he would move on to a more prestigious university.) But Adler ignored the advice and decided to become an editor at the Social Democratic Party newspaper. Loyalty to a party, Einstein felt, meant surrendering some independence of thought. Such conformity confounded him. “How an intelligent man can subscribe to a party I find a complete mystery,” Einstein later lamented about Adler.<sup><a id="filepos470400"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698052">3</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦劝阿德勒埋头钻研科学，不要参与政治。“耐心一点，”他说，“总有一天，你肯定会接替我在苏黎世（大学）任教。”（爱因斯坦认为自己将会转到一个更有名的大学。）但阿德勒没有听从，执意担任社会民主党报的编辑。爱因斯坦感到，效忠于一个党派就意味着放弃了某种思想的独立性，这种顺从使他感到惶惑。“一个这样睿智的人如何可能会效忠于一个政党，这在我看来是完全不可思议的。”爱因斯坦后来这样悼念阿德勒。

Einstein was also reunited with his former classmate and note-taker Marcel Grossmann, who had helped him get his job at the patent office and was now a professor of math at their old Polytechnic. Einstein would often visit Grossmann after lunch for help with the complex geometry and calculus he needed to extend relativity into a more general field theory.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在苏黎世，爱因斯坦还见到了老同学格罗斯曼。格罗斯曼当年曾把笔记借给他，并帮他找到专利局的工作。如今，格罗斯曼已是苏黎世联邦工学院的数学教授。爱因斯坦经常在午饭后拜访格罗斯曼，就一些复杂的几何和微积分运算寻求他的帮助，以把相对论拓展成更加一般的场论。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein was even able to forge a friendship with the other distinguished math professor at the Polytechnic, Adolf Hurwitz, whose classes he had often skipped and who had spurned his plea for a job. Einstein became a regular at the Sunday music recitals at Hurwitz’s home. When Hurwitz told him during a walk one day that his daughter had been given a math homework problem she did not understand, Einstein showed up that afternoon to help her solve it.<sup><a id="filepos471376"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698189">4</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦甚至与联邦工学院的另一位著名数学教授胡尔维茨结下了友谊。当年，爱因斯坦经常逃胡尔维茨的课，胡尔维茨也曾断然拒绝爱因斯坦的工作请求。每逢周日，胡尔维茨家会举行音乐会，爱因斯坦则成了那里的常客。一天散步时，胡尔维茨说他女儿有一道数学作业题弄不明白，爱因斯坦下午便去帮她解决了这个问题。

As Kleiner predicted, Einstein’s teaching talents improved. He was not a polished lecturer, but instead used informality to his advantage. “When he took his chair in shabby attire with trousers too short for him, we were skeptical,” recalled Hans Tanner, who attended most of Einstein’s Zurich lectures. Instead of prepared notes, Einstein used a card-sized strip of paper with scribbles. So the students got to watch him develop his thoughts as he spoke. “We obtained some insight into his working technique,” said Tanner. “We certainly appreciated this more than any stylistically perfect lecture.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
正如克莱纳所预言的，爱因斯坦的教学能力已经有所提高。虽然他不是一个举止优雅、衣冠楚楚的老师，但这种不拘小节也会成为他的优势。“他上衣很破，裤子有些短，坐下来开始上课，看到这些我们将信将疑。”曾经在苏黎世大学听过爱因斯坦许多课程的汉斯·坦纳回忆说。爱因斯坦没有讲义，只有一张卡片大小的写满字的纸条。他边说边想，不紧不慢地提出自己的观点，学生们细细地观察着这一切。“我们见识了他的推理技巧，”坦纳说，“相比于那些讲求完美的授课方式，我们肯定更欣赏这种。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos472179"></a>At each step of the way, Einstein would pause and ask the students if they were following him, and he even permitted interruptions. “This comradely contact between teacher and student was, at that time, a rare occurrence,” according to Adolf Fisch, another who attended the lectures. Sometimes he would take a break and let the students gather around him for casual conversation. “With an impulsiveness and naturalness he would take students by the arm to discuss things,” recalled Tanner.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

在讲课过程中，爱因斯坦不时停下来问学生们是否跟得上，也允许学生们打断他。“在当时，老师与学生之间的这种热情互动并不常见。”另一位听过课的学生阿道夫·菲什说。他休息时，有时会让学生们围坐在他身旁聊天。“偶尔一时兴起，还会抓住学生的胳膊讨论。”坦纳回忆说。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

During one lecture, Einstein found himself momentarily stumped about the steps needed to complete a calculation. “There must be some silly mathematical transformation that I can’t find for a moment,” he said. “Can one of you gentlemen see it?” Not surprisingly, none of them could. So Einstein continued: “Then leave a quarter of a page. We won’t lose any time.”Ten minutes later, Einstein interrupted himself in the middle of another point and exclaimed, “I’ve got it.” As Tanner later marveled, “During the complicated development of his theme he had still found time to reflect upon the nature of that particular mathematical transformation.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在一次上课时，爱因斯坦忽然想不起一项计算应当如何进行了。“一定是哪个该死的数学变换，我一下想不起来了，”他说，“在座的有谁能看出来吗？”毫不奇怪，没有人看得出来。爱因斯坦接着说：“那么我们跳过1/4页，不再浪费时间。”10分钟后，爱因斯坦在讲解别的内容时停下来喊道：“我知道了。”正如坦纳后来赞叹的：“虽然他的讨论主题复杂多变，他仍能抽出时间反思那一特殊数学变换的实质。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

At the end of many of his evening lectures, Einstein would ask, “Who’s coming to the Café Terasse?” There, with an informal cadre on a terrace overlooking the Limmat River, they would talk until closing time.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

在晚间快要下课时，爱因斯坦经常会问：“谁打算去露台咖啡馆（Café Terasse）？”就这样，一个非正式群体组成了。他们在露台上一边眺望着利马特河（Limmat River）一边交谈，直到咖啡馆打烊为止。
</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

On one occasion, Einstein asked if anyone wanted to come back to his apartment. “This morning I received some work from Planck in which there must be a mistake,” he said. “We could read it together.” Tanner and another student took him up on the offer and followed him home. There they all pored over Planck’s paper. “See if you can spot the fault while I make some coffee,” he said.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


有一次，爱因斯坦问学生们有谁想去他的寓所。“今天早上我收到了普朗克寄来的研究论文，其中肯定有错误，”他说，“我们可以一起读它。”坦纳和另一个学生接受了邀请，随他一起到了家，然后立刻开始审读普朗克的论文。“我去准备咖啡，看看你们能否发现其中的错误。”他说。



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

After a while, Tanner replied, “You must be mistaken, Herr Professor, there is no error in it.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
过了一会儿，坦纳喊道：“您一定弄错了，教授先生，这里面没有错误。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

“Yes, there is,” Einstein said, pointing to some discrepancies in the data, “for otherwise that and that would become that and that.” It was a vivid example of Einstein’s great strength: he could look at a complex mathematical equation, which for others was merely an abstraction, and picture the physical reality that lay behind it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
“看，错误在这儿呢，”爱因斯坦指着一些不一致的数据说，“因为如若不然，某某东西就会变成某某东西。”这正是爱因斯坦卓越才能的一个生动例证，他可以透过一个复杂的数学方程（在别人看来这仅仅是一种抽象），看出其背后隐藏的物理实在。



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos474890"></a>Tanner was astounded. “Let’s write to Professor Planck,” he suggested, “and tell him of the mistake.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
坦纳呆住了。他提议：“我们写信给普朗克教授，向他指出这个错误。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein had by then become slightly more tactful, especially with those he placed on a pedestal, such as Planck and Lorentz. “We won’t tell him he made a mistake,” he said. “The result is correct, but the proof is faulty. We’ll simply write and tell him how the real proof should run. The main thing is the content, not the mathematics.”<sup><a id="filepos475464"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698327">5</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦这时已经变得更加圆通，特别是对普朗克和洛伦兹这样的偶像式人物。“我们不要告诉他犯了一个错误，”他说，“结果是正确的，但证明错了。我们只需写信告诉他实际证明应当是怎样的。重要的是内容，而不是数学。” 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Despite his work on his machine to measure electrical charges, Einstein had become a confirmed theorist rather than experimental physicist. When he was asked during his second year as a professor to supervise laboratory work, he was dismayed. He hardly dared, he told Tanner, “pick up a piece of apparatus for fear it might blow up.” To another eminent professor he confided, “My fears regarding the laboratory were rather well founded.”<sup><a id="filepos476028"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698490">6</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
虽然爱因斯坦曾经研制过测量电荷的机器，但他已经成了一位实打实的理论物理学家而不是实验物理学家。第二年，有人希望由他来指导实验室工作，他很恐慌。他告诉坦纳说，自己几乎不敢“拿起一件仪器，因为担心它会爆炸”。他向另一位著名教授坦言：“我对实验室的恐惧由来已久。”

As he was finishing his first academic year at Zurich, in July 1910, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> gave birth, again with difficulty, to their second son, named Eduard and called Tete. She was ill for weeks afterward. Her doctor, contending that she was overworked, suggested that Einstein find a way to make more money and pay for a maid. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> was annoyed and protective. “Isn’t it clear to anyone that my husband works himself half dead?” she said. Instead, her mother came down from Novi Sad to help.<sup><a id="filepos476707"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698674">7</a></sup>

<p>
1910年7月，爱因斯坦即将在苏黎世大学待满一年，这时米列娃（艰难地）生下了第二个儿子，名叫爱德华，小名泰特（Tete），然后一连病了几个星期。医生认定她劳累过度，建议爱因斯坦多挣些钱雇一个女仆。米列娃很生气，她本能地庇护起爱因斯坦来。“我丈夫的工作已经把他累个半死了，这难道不是明摆着吗？”她说。最后，米列娃的妈妈不得不从诺维萨德赶来帮忙。

Throughout his life, Einstein would sometimes appear aloof toward his two sons, especially Eduard, who suffered from increasingly severe mental illness as he grew older. But when they were young, he tended to be a good father. “When my mother was busy around the house, father would put aside his work and watch over us for hours, bouncing us on his knee,” Hans Albert later recalled. “I remember he would tell us stories—and he often played the violin in an effort to keep us quiet.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


虽然爱因斯坦有时对两个儿子显得比较疏远，特别是对精神疾病越来越重的爱德华，但在他们小的时候，爱因斯坦的确在努力做一个好父亲。“当妈妈忙于家务时，爸爸会放下工作，一连几小时照看我们，把我们放在膝上摇来摇去，”汉斯·阿尔伯特后来回忆说，“我记得他会给我们讲故事，还经常拉小提琴使我们安静下来。”

One of his strengths as a thinker, if not as a parent, was that he had the ability, and the inclination, to tune out all distractions, a category that to him sometimes included his children and family. “Even the loudest baby-crying didn’t seem to disturb Father,” Hans Albert said. “He could go on with his work completely impervious to noise.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
作为思想家（如果不是作为家长）他有一种排除一切干扰的能力。对他而言，这种干扰有时也包括他的孩子和家庭。“甚至婴儿的大声哭闹都打扰不了爸爸，”汉斯·阿尔伯特说，“他能够继续自己的工作，完全不受噪声的影响。”

One day his student Tanner came for a visit and found Einstein in <a id="filepos477873"></a>his study poring over a pile of papers. He was writing with his right hand and holding Eduard with his left. Hans Albert was playing with toy bricks and trying to get his attention. “Wait a minute, I’ve nearly finished,” Einstein said, as he handed Eduard to Tanner and kept scribbling his equations. “It gave me,” said Tanner, “a glimpse into his immense powers of concentration.”<sup><a id="filepos478308"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698835">8</a></sup>

一天，来访的学生坦纳发现，爱因斯坦正在书房专心研究一叠论文。他右手写字，左手抱着爱德华。汉斯·阿尔伯特正在一旁玩着砖块，想引起他的注意。“等等，我马上就看完了。”爱因斯坦边说边把爱德华交给坦纳，然后继续演算他的方程。坦纳说：“这使我窥见了他巨大的专注力。”

Einstein had been in Zurich less than six months when he received, in March 1910, a solicitation to consider a more prestigious job: a full professorship at the German part of the University of Prague. Both the university and the academic position were a step up; however, moving from the familiar and friendly Zurich to the less congenial Prague would be disruptive for his family. For Einstein, the professional considerations outweighed the personal ones.
</p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


1910年3月，爱因斯坦收到了一封信，邀请他出任布拉格大学（德语） 的正教授。这是一份声望更高的工作，无论是大学还是学术地位都上了一层。然而，从熟悉而友好的苏黎世搬到不那么舒适的布拉格有可能会导致家庭破裂。对爱因斯坦来说，职业上的考虑要重于个人事务。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

He was again going through difficult periods at home. “The bad mood that you noticed in me had nothing to do with you,” he wrote to his mother, who was now living in Berlin. “To dwell on the things that depress or anger us does not help in overcoming them. One must knock them down alone.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


在家里，他的日子又一次难熬了起来。“您注意到我心情不好，但这与您没有关系，”他给居住在柏林的妈妈写信说，“跟别人唠叨那些让我们沮丧和不快的事情，对克服它们毫无帮助。自己的问题只能自己解决。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

His scientific work, on the other hand, was giving him great pleasure, and he expressed excitement about his possible new opportunity. “It is most probable that I will be offered the position of full professor at a large university with a significantly better salary than I now have.”<sup><a id="filepos479711"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699088">9</a></sup>

When word of Einstein’s possible move spread in Zurich, fifteen of his students, led by Hans Tanner, signed a petition urging officials there “to do your utmost to keep this outstanding researcher and teacher at our university.” They stressed the importance of having a professor in “this newly created discipline” of theoretical physics, and they extolled him personally in effusive terms. “Professor Einstein has an amazing talent for presenting the most difficult problems of theoretical physics so clearly and so comprehensibly that it is a great delight for us to follow his lectures, and he is so good at establishing a perfect rapport with his audience.”<sup><a id="filepos480517"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699252">10</a></sup>

关于爱因斯坦可能离校的传言在苏黎世大学不胫而走。他的15位学生写了一封请愿书，敦促主管部门能够“尽你们所能，将这位出色的研究人员和教师留在我们学校”。他们强调了在“这个新设立的理论物理专业”拥有一名教授的重要性，并对爱因斯坦大加称赞。“爱因斯坦教授有一种惊人的才能，他能够把最难理解的理论物理学问题讲得清晰易懂，我们都很喜欢上他的课，而且他很善于和听众建立一种和谐融洽的关系。”

The Zurich authorities were so eager to keep him that they raised <a id="filepos480682"></a>his salary from its current 4,500 francs, which was the same as he made as a patent examiner, to 5,500 francs. Those attempting to lure him to Prague, on the other hand, were having a more difficult time.

The faculty department at Prague had settled on Einstein as its first choice and forwarded the recommendation to the education ministry in Vienna. (Prague was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and such an appointment had to be approved by Emperor Franz Joseph and his ministers.) The report was accompanied by the highest possible recommendation from the best possible authority, Max Planck. Einstein’s theory of relativity “probably exceeds in audacity everything that has been achieved so far in speculative science,” Planck proclaimed. “This principle has brought about a revolution in our physical picture of the world that can be compared only to that produced by Copernicus.” In a comment that might later have seemed prescient to Einstein, Planck added, “Non-Euclidean geometry is child’s play by comparison.”<sup><a id="filepos481827"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699440">11</a></sup>

布拉格大学教务部已经把爱因斯坦定为首选，并将报告上呈维也纳教育部。（布拉格当时属于奥匈帝国的一部分，这样一种任命必须得到弗朗茨·约瑟夫皇帝及其幕僚的首肯。）泰斗式人物普朗克还为此写了充满溢美之词的推荐语。爱因斯坦的相对论“在胆识上或许超出了思辨科学迄今为止已经取得的一切成就，”普朗克宣称，“这一原理已经给我们关于世界的物理图景带来了一场革命，只有哥白尼所带来的革命可与之比肩。”普朗克还颇有预见地评论道：“与此相比，非欧几何只不过是小孩的游戏。”

Planck’s imprimatur should have been enough. But it wasn’t. The ministry decided that it preferred the second-place candidate, Gustav Jaumann, who had two advantages: he was Austrian, and he was not Jewish. “I did not get the call to Prague,” Einstein lamented to a friend in August. “I was proposed by the faculty, but because of my Semitic origin the ministry did not approve.”

有了普朗克的认可，事情本来应该没有悬念了。然而事实并非如此。教育部更倾向于一个二流候选人古斯塔夫·尧曼，因为他有两个优势：首先，他是奥地利人；其次，他不是犹太人。“我没有得到去布拉格的通知，”爱因斯坦8月向一位朋友抱怨，“我已经被系里提名，但由于我的犹太血统，教育部不批准。”

Jaumann, however, soon discovered that he was the faculty’s second choice, and he erupted. “If Einstein has been proposed as the first choice because of the belief that he has greater achievements to his credit,” he declared, “then I will have nothing to do with a university that chases after modernity and does not appreciate merit.” So by October 1910, Einstein could confidently declare that his own appointment was “almost certain.”

然而，尧曼很快就发现自己是系里的第二选择。他坐不住了。“如果爱因斯坦是因为取得了更大成就而被提名为首选，”他宣称，“那么我将不会与一所只追求时髦而不论是非的大学为伍。”就这样，到了1910年10月，爱因斯坦可以安心地宣布，他本人的任命“几乎没有悬念了”。

There was one final hurdle, also dealing with religion. Being a Jew was a disadvantage; being a nonbeliever who claimed <em>no</em> religion was a disqualifier. The empire required that all of its servants, including professors, be a member of some religion. On his official forms, Einstein had written that he had none. “Einstein is as unpractical as a child in cases like this,” Friedrich Adler’s wife noted.

最后一道障碍也与宗教有关。身为犹太人是不利因素，身为一个宣称不属于任何宗教派系的无信仰者则要被剥夺资格。包括教授在内，帝国要求其所有臣民都信仰某种宗教。而在正式表格里，爱因斯坦填的是无信仰。“在这方面，爱因斯坦天真得就像个孩子。”阿德勒的妻子说。

As it turned out, Einstein’s desire for the job was greater than his <a id="filepos483494"></a>ornery impracticality. He agreed to write “Mosaic” as his faith, and he also accepted Austro-Hungarian citizenship, with the proviso that he was allowed to remain a Swiss citizen as well. Along with the German citizenship that he had forsaken but that would soon be foisted back on him, that meant he had held, off and on, three citizenships by the age of 32. In January 1911, he was officially appointed to the post, with a pay twice what he had been making before his recent raise. He agreed to move to Prague that March.<sup><a id="filepos484041"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699664">12</a></sup>

结果，爱因斯坦对工作的渴望还是胜过了执拗的不切实际。他答应把“摩西的（犹太教）”（Mosaic）写为他的信仰，也接受了奥匈帝国国籍，条件是自己同时也是瑞士公民。加上他已经放弃但不久又会被强加的德国国籍，他在32岁之前已经陆陆续续获得了3个国籍。1911年1月，爱因斯坦被正式授予这一职位，薪水相当于最近提薪之前水平的两倍。他同意当年3月搬到布拉格。

Einstein had two scientific heroes he had never met—Ernst Mach and Hendrik Lorentz—and he was able to visit them both before his move to Prague. When he went to Vienna for his formal presentation to the ministers there, he called on Mach, who lived in a suburb of that city. The aging physicist and preacher of empiricism, who so deeply influenced the Olympia Academy and instilled in Einstein a skepticism about unobservable concepts such as absolute time, had a gnarly beard and gnarlier personality. “Please speak loudly to me,” he barked when Einstein entered his room. “In addition to my other unpleasant characteristics I am also almost stone deaf.”

爱因斯坦还有两位以前从未谋面的科学偶像——马赫和洛伦兹，在搬往布拉格之前，爱因斯坦见到了他们两位。他在到维也纳向部长们做正式陈述时，拜望了住在维也纳郊区的马赫。这位年事已高的物理学家鼓吹经验论，他深深地影响了奥林匹亚科学院，并且帮助爱因斯坦培养了一种怀疑论，对绝对时间等无法观察的概念保持怀疑。马赫胡须浓密，性情乖戾。“请大声跟我说话，”爱因斯坦进屋时他吼道，“我不仅性格惹人讨厌，而且还是个聋子。”

Einstein wanted to convince Mach of the reality of atoms, which the old man had long rejected as being imaginary constructs of the human mind. “Let us suppose that by assuming the existence of atoms in a gas we were able to predict an observable property of this gas that could not be predicted on the basis of non-atomistic theory,” Einstein asked. “Would you then accept such a hypothesis?”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦试图说服马赫相信原子的实在性。长期以来，马赫一直把原子斥为人类心灵的虚构，无法直接观察到。“倘若通过假设气体原子的存在，我们能够预言该气体的一种可观察的特性，而不基于原子论就做不出这种预言，”爱因斯坦问道，“那么你是否会接受这一假说？”

“If with the help of the atomic hypothesis one could actually establish a connection between several observable properties which without it would remain isolated, then I should say that this hypothesis was an ‘economical’ one,” Mach grudgingly replied.

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

“倘若借助于原子假说，我们可以在一些可观察特性之间实际建立起联系，而不这样做这些特性就会保持孤立，那么我会说，这一假说是‘经济的’。”马赫勉强地回答道。

It was not a full acceptance, but it was enough for Einstein. “For the moment Einstein was satisfied,” his friend Philipp Frank noted. Nevertheless, Einstein began edging away from Mach’s skepticism about any theories of reality not built on directly observable data. He developed, said Frank, “a certain aversion to the Machist philosophy.”<sup><a id="filepos486070"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699988">13</a></sup> It was the beginning of an important conversion.

虽然没有完全接受，但这对爱因斯坦已经足够了。“爱因斯坦此刻心满意足。”他的朋友弗兰克说。然而，爱因斯坦已经渐渐开始摆脱马赫那种针对任何不基于直接观测数据的实在理论的怀疑论。弗兰克说，他产生了“对马赫主义哲学的某种厌恶”。 这正是一次重要转变的开始。

Lorentz thought he had caught Einstein in a small mathematical mistake in one of his papers on light quanta, but in fact, as Einstein noted, it was simply “a one-time writing error” where he had left out a “½” that was included later in the paper.<sup><a id="filepos487457"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1700498">15</a></sup> Both the hospitality and “scientific stimulus” made Einstein effusive in his next letter. “You radiate so much goodness and benevolence,” he wrote, “that the troubling conviction that I did not deserve the great kindness and honors could not even enter my mind during my stay at your house.”<sup><a id="filepos487832"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1700656">16</a></sup>

The best easy chair was carefully pushed in place next to the large work table for his esteemed guest. A cigar was given to him, and then Lorentz quietly began to formulate questions concerning Einstein’s theory of the bending of light in a gravitational field . . . As Lorentz spoke on, Einstein began to puff less frequently on his cigar, and he sat more intently in his armchair. And when Lorentz had finished, Einstein bent over the slip of paper on which Lorentz had written mathematical formulas. The cigar was out, and Einstein pensively twisted his finger in a lock of hair over his right ear. Lorentz sat smiling at an Einstein completely lost in meditation, exactly the way that a father looks at a particularly beloved son—full of confidence that the youngster will crack the nut he has given him, but eager to see how. Suddenly, Einstein’s head sat up joyfully; he had it. Still a bit of give and take, interrupting one another, a partial disagreement, very quick clarification and a complete mutual understanding, and then both men with beaming eyes skimming over the shining riches of the new theory.<sup><a id="filepos489447"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1700820">17</a></sup>

From Einstein’s office at the university he could look down on a beautiful park with shady trees and manicured gardens. In the morning, it would be filled just with women, and in the afternoon just with men. Some walked alone as if deep in thought, Einstein noticed, while others clustered in groups holding animated arguments. Eventually, Einstein asked what the park was.

The character is devoted to his scientific work and is always willing to throw away conventional thinking. But in the realm of the personal, he is protected from “the aberrations of feeling” <a id="filepos492448"></a>by his aloof and abstracted air. “He had no heart and therefore nothing to fear from the world,” Brod wrote. “He was not capable of emotion or love.” When the novel came out, a fellow scientist, Walther Nernst, said to Einstein, “You are this man Kepler.”<sup><a id="filepos492751"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1701870">21</a></sup>

Not really. Despite the image he sometimes cast as a loner, Einstein continued to establish, as he had back in Zurich and Bern, intimate friendships and emotional bonds, particularly with fellow thinkers and scientists. One such friend was Paul Ehrenfest, a young Jewish physicist from Vienna who was teaching at the University of St. Petersburg but feeling professionally stymied there because of his background. In early 1912, he embarked on a trip through Europe looking for a new job, and on his way toward Prague contacted Einstein, with whom he had been corresponding about gravity and radiation. “Do stay at my house so that we can make good use of the time,” Einstein responded.<sup><a id="filepos493553"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1702122">22</a></sup>

这有些言过其实。虽然爱因斯坦有时会显得不合群，但在回到苏黎世和伯尔尼之后，他与不少人都结下了亲密的友谊，形成了良好的人际关系，特别是一些思想家和科学家同道。埃伦菲斯特就是其中一位。这位年轻的犹太物理学家来自维也纳，在圣彼得堡大学执教，但由于背景不同，他在那里觉得很受排挤。1912年年初，他开始游历欧洲寻找新的工作，在前往布拉格的路上遇到了爱因斯坦，此前他们一直通信讨论引力和辐射。“请您一定在我家住下，这样我们可以充分利用时间。”爱因斯坦回信说。

Einstein was already thinking of leaving Prague, and he suggested Ehrenfest as a possible successor. But he “adamantly refuses to profess any religious affiliation,” Einstein lamented.

Matters eventually came to a happy resolution when Ehrenfest accepted an offer, which Einstein had earlier received but declined, to replace the revered Lorentz, who was cutting back from full-time teaching at the University of Leiden. Einstein was thrilled, for it meant he would now have two friends there to visit regularly. It became, for Einstein, almost a second academic home and a way to escape the oppressive atmosphere he later found in Berlin. Almost every year for the next two decades, until 1933 when Ehrenfest committed suicide and Einstein moved to America, Einstein would make regular pilgrimages to see him and Lorentz in Leiden or at the seaside resorts nearby.<sup><a id="filepos496549"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703304">26</a></sup>

The kindly Hendrik Lorentz served as the chairman, as his fan Einstein put it, “with incomparable tact and unbelievable virtuosity.”<sup><a id="filepos497837"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703520">27</a></sup>

到布鲁塞尔的都会大酒店（Grand Hotel Metropole）出席会议的有20位欧洲最著名的科学家，32岁的爱因斯坦是最年轻的一位。与会者还包括普朗克、庞加莱、居里夫人、卢瑟福和维恩等人。化学家能斯特负责组织会议，不离老谋深算的索尔维左右。会议主席则由和蔼可亲的洛伦兹出任。正如他的忠实崇拜者爱因斯坦所说：“无可比拟的老练，技巧难以置信的高超。”

The focus of the conference was “the quantum problem,” and Einstein was asked to present a paper on that topic, making him one of only eight “particularly competent members” thus honored. He expressed <a id="filepos498161"></a>some annoyance, perhaps a bit more feigned than real, about the prestigious assignment. He dubbed the upcoming meeting “the witch’s Sabbath” and complained to Besso, “My twaddle for the Brussels conference weighs down on me.”<sup><a id="filepos498428"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703684">28</a></sup>

会议围绕着“量子问题”而展开。爱因斯坦应约提交了一篇论文，使他跻身“八强成员”之一。对于这种令人受宠若惊的称号，他略带夸张地表达了自己的烦恼。他把即将举行的这次会议称为“巫师大聚会”，还向贝索抱怨说：“我为布鲁塞尔会议准备的蠢话把我搞得疲惫不堪。”

Einstein’s talk was titled “The Present State of the Problem of Specific Heats.” Specific heat—the quantity of energy required to increase the temperature of a specific amount of substance by a certain amount—had been a specialty of Einstein’s former professor and antagonist at the Zurich Polytechnic, Heinrich Weber. Weber had discovered some anomalies, especially at low temperatures, in the laws that were supposed to govern specific heat. Beginning in late 1906, Einstein had come up with what he called a “quantized” approach to the problem by surmising that the atoms in each substance could absorb energy only in discrete packets.

爱因斯坦的演讲名为“论比热容问题的现状”。比热容——单位质量的某种物质温度升高1℃所需的热量——曾经是爱因斯坦在苏黎世联邦工学院的老对手韦伯教授的专长，他曾经发现过比热容定律在低温情况下的一些反常。从1906年年底开始，爱因斯坦就用所谓的“量子化”方法来解决问题，即假定每种物质的原子只能以离散包的形式来吸收能量。

In his 1911 Solvay lecture, Einstein put these issues into the larger context of the so-called quantum problem. Was it possible, he asked, to avoid accepting the physical reality of these atomistic particles of light, which were like bullets aimed at the heart of Maxwell’s equations and, indeed, all of classical physics?

在1911年的索尔维会议上，爱因斯坦结合量子问题这一更大背景来讨论这些问题。他问道，我们是否可能不接受这些原子式的光微粒的物理实在性，它们如子弹一般，瞄准了麦克斯韦方程乃至整个经典物理学的核心？

Planck, who had pioneered the concept of the quanta, continued to insist that they came into play only when light was being emitted or absorbed. They were not a real-world feature of light itself, he argued. Einstein, in his talk to the conference, sorrowfully demurred: “These discontinuities, which we find so distasteful in Planck’s theory, seem really to exist in nature.”<sup><a id="filepos500054"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703917">29</a></sup>

<p>
作为量子概念的先驱，普朗克一直坚称，只有当光被发射或吸收时才是如此，光的粒子性并非光本身的实在特征。爱因斯坦在会议上悲伤地反对说：“这些在普朗克理论中那么令人反感的非连续性，在自然中似乎是真实存在的。”

<em>Really to exist in nature.</em> It was, for Einstein, an odd phrase. To a pure proponent of Mach, or for that matter of Hume, the whole phrase “really to exist in nature” lacked clear meaning. In his special relativity theory, Einstein had avoided assuming the existence of such things as absolute time and absolute distance, because it seemed meaningless to say that they “really” existed in nature when they couldn’t be observed. But henceforth, during the more than four decades in which he would express his discomfort with quantum theory, he increasingly sounded like a scientific realist, someone who believed that an underlying reality existed in nature that was independent of our ability to observe or measure it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

在自然中真实存在，在爱因斯坦看来，这是一种奇怪的说法。在马赫或休谟的支持者看来，“在自然中真实存在”这种说法的含义不够清晰。在狭义相对论中，爱因斯坦没有假设绝对时间和绝对距离的存在，因为如果观察不到，那么说它们“真实”存在于自然似乎是没有意义的。然而在此后的多年里，随着对量子理论的不安与日俱增，爱因斯坦越来越像一个科学实在论者。他相信自然中隐藏着一种实在，不依赖于我们的观察或测量。

<a id="filepos500966"></a>When he was finished, Einstein faced a barrage of challenges from Lorentz, Planck, Poincaré, and others. Some of what Einstein said, Lorentz rose to point out,“seems in fact to be totally incompatible with Maxwell’s equations.”

Einstein agreed, perhaps too readily, that “the quantum hypothesis is provisional” and that it “does not seem compatible with the experimentally verified conclusions of the wave theory.” Somehow it was necessary, he told his questioners, to accommodate both wave and particle approaches to the understanding of light. “In addition to Maxwell’s electrodynamics, which is essential to us, we must also admit a hypothesis such as that of quanta.”<sup><a id="filepos501770"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704251">30</a></sup>

爱因斯坦同意，或许欣然同意，“量子假说是一种权宜之计”，它“似乎与已由实验证实的波动说结论不相容”。但他对提问者说，必须以某种方式来调和光的波动说和微粒说。“除了我们不可或缺的麦克斯韦电动力学，我们也必须承认像量子这样的假说。”

It was unclear, even to Einstein, whether Planck was persuaded of the reality of quanta. “I largely succeeded in convincing Planck that my conception is correct, after he has struggled against it for so many years,” Einstein wrote his friend Heinrich Zangger. But a week later, Einstein gave Zangger another report: “Planck stuck stubbornly to some undoubtedly wrong preconceptions.”

爱因斯坦并不清楚普朗克是否已经相信了量子的实在性。“我差不多成功说服了普朗克，在他苦苦反对我的观点这么多年之后，使他相信我的观点是正确的。”爱因斯坦写信给朋友海因里希·仓格尔说。但一周之后，爱因斯坦又对仓格尔说：“普朗克顽固地坚持某些错误无疑的先入之见。”

As for Lorentz, Einstein remained as admiring as ever: “A living work of art! He was in my opinion the most intelligent of the theoreticians present.” He dismissed Poincaré, who paid little attention to him, with a brusque stroke: “Poincaré was simply negative in general, and, all his acumen notwithstanding, he showed little grasp of the situation.”<sup><a id="filepos502723"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704436">31</a></sup>

至于洛伦兹，爱因斯坦仍然一如既往地敬佩：“一件活脱脱的艺术品！在我看来，他是当代理论家中最有才智的。”而对于很少重视过他的庞加莱，则硬生生地评价了一句：“庞加莱一般仅仅是否定，尽管他很敏锐，但他很少把握事情的实质。”

Overall he gave low marks to the conference, where most of the time was spent bewailing rather than resolving quantum theory’s threat to classical mechanics. “The congress in Brussels resembled the lamentations on the ruins of Jerusalem,” he wrote Besso. “Nothing positive has come out of it.”<sup><a id="filepos503150"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704607">32</a></sup>

There was one interesting sideshow for Einstein: the romance between the widowed Marie Curie and the married Paul Langevin. Dignified and dedicated, Madame Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize; she shared the 1903 physics prize with her husband and one other scientist for their work on radiation. Three years later, her husband was killed by a horse-drawn wagon. She was bereft, and so was her late husband’s protégé, Langevin, who taught physics at the Sorbonne with the Curies. Langevin was trapped in a marriage with a <a id="filepos503798"></a>wife who physically abused him, and soon he and Marie Curie were having an affair in a Paris apartment. His wife had someone break into it and steal their love letters.

在爱因斯坦看来，会议期间还发生了一件趣事：寡居的居里夫人和已婚的保罗·朗之万之间的浪漫故事。居里夫人德高望重，富有献身精神，是第一位获得诺贝尔奖的女性；1903年，她与丈夫以及另一位科学家因为辐射方面的研究而分享了诺贝尔物理学奖。三年后，居里夫人的丈夫被马车撞死。朗之万是她丈夫的门生，与居里夫妇同在巴黎大学教物理学。他的婚姻很不幸，因为妻子总是虐待他。不久，他和居里夫人在巴黎的一间寓所幽会。朗之万的妻子差人潜入，偷走了他们的情书。

Just as the Solvay Conference was getting under way, with both Curie and Langevin in attendance, the purloined letters began appearing in a Paris tabloid as a prelude to a sensational divorce case. In addition, at that very moment, it was announced that Curie had won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, for discovering radium and polonium.<a id="filepos504364"></a><a href="Einstein_split_052.html#filepos2411178">*</a> A member of the Swedish Academy wrote her to suggest that she not appear to receive it, given the furor raised by her relationship with Langevin, but she coolly responded, “I believe there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life.” She headed to Stockholm and accepted the prize.<sup><a id="filepos504729"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704769">33</a></sup>

居里夫人和朗之万都参加了索尔维会议。会议期间，被盗取的情书开始在一家巴黎小报上刊载，拉开了轰动一时的离婚事件的序幕。就在这时消息传来，居里夫人因为发现镭和钋而获得了诺贝尔化学奖。 瑞典科学院写信给她说，鉴于她与朗之万的暧昧关系所引发的狂热，建议她不要来领奖。但她镇定自若地回信说：“我认为在我的科学工作与私生活之间没有关联。”索尔维会议结束后没过几个星期，她前往斯德哥尔摩领取诺贝尔奖。

The whole furor seemed silly to Einstein. “She is an unpretentious, honest person,” he said, with “a sparkling intelligence.” He also rather bluntly came to the conclusion, not justified, that she was not pretty enough to wreck anyone’s marriage. “Despite her passionate nature,” he said, “she is not attractive enough to represent a danger to anyone.”<sup><a id="filepos505239"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704911">34</a></sup>
</p>
</div>

<p>
在爱因斯坦看来，整个狂热是愚不可及的。“她是一个朴实无华的人，而且才华横溢。”他还不太恰当地断定，居里夫人的长相还不足以拆散别人的婚姻：“尽管她生性热情，但她的魅力还不足以对他人构成威胁。”

As Einstein wandered around Europe giving speeches and basking in his rising renown, his wife stayed behind in Prague, a city she hated, and brooded about not being part of the scientific circles that she once struggled to join. “I would like to have been there and listened a little, and seen all these fine people,” she wrote him after one of his talks in October 1911. “It is so long since we saw each other that I wonder if you will recognize me.” She signed herself, “Deine alte D,” your old D, as if she were still his Dollie, albeit a bit older.<sup><a id="filepos507119"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1705409">36</a></sup>

正当爱因斯坦声名鹊起，在欧洲巡回讲演之时，米列娃却仍然待在她所厌恶的布拉格，为自己没有进入曾经向往的科学界而垂头丧气。“我很想在那里听上一听，亲眼看看所有这些杰出人士，”1911年10月的一次讲演之后她写信给爱因斯坦说，“自从我们分别以来，时间好像已经过了很久很久，你还会认得我吗？”她的签名是，“你的老D”，就好像尽管青春已逝，她依然是他的多莉。

Her circumstances, perhaps combined with an innate disposition, caused her to become gloomy, even depressed. When Philipp Frank met her in Prague for the first time, he thought that she might be schizophrenic. Einstein concurred, and he later told a colleague that her gloominess “is doubtless traceable to a schizophrenic genetic disposition coming from her mother’s family.”<sup><a id="filepos507617"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1705608">37</a></sup>

这使得生性沉默寡言的米列娃变得更加阴郁和情绪低落。弗兰克第一次在布拉格见到她时，就觉得她似乎患上了精神分裂症。爱因斯坦也有同样的看法，他后来告诉一位同事，她的阴郁“无疑可以追溯到她母亲家族的一种精神分裂的遗传倾向”。

And Elsa, who revered her cousin, was eager to give it. When he returned to Prague, she wrote him right away—sending the letter to his office, not his home, and proposing a way they could correspond in secret. “How dear of you not to be too proud to communicate with me in such a way!” he responded. “I can’t even begin to tell you how fond I have become of you during these few days.” She asked him to destroy her letters, which he did. She, on the other hand, kept his responses for the rest of her life in a folder that she tied and later labeled “Especially beautiful letters from better days.”<sup><a id="filepos510573"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1706098">40</a></sup>

受新的爱情驱策，向往着在理论物理之都的工作，爱因斯坦渴望搬到柏林。“不幸的是，我在柏林找到工作的机会很小。”

他向爱尔莎承认。但在访问柏林的时候，他竭尽所能为日后能在那里任职而努力。他在笔记本上列出了他与几位重要的学术界巨头的会面，包括科学家哈伯、能斯特和瓦尔堡等。

Einstein’s son Hans Albert later recalled that it was just after his eighth birthday, in the spring of 1912, when he noticed that his parents’ marriage was falling apart. But after returning to Prague from Berlin, Einstein seemed to develop qualms about his affair with his cousin. He tried, in two letters, to put an end to it. “There would only be confusion and misfortune if we were to give into our mutual attraction,” he wrote Elsa.

爱因斯坦的儿子汉斯·阿尔伯特后来回忆说，1912年春天，就在自己过完8岁生日之后，他注意到父母的婚姻正在瓦解。但是从柏林回到布拉格之后，爱因斯坦似乎对他与表姐的新的感情纠葛产生了不安。他一连写了两封信，试图做一了结。“如果我们屈从于我们彼此之间的感情，就只能产生混乱和不幸。”他写信给爱尔莎。

Later that month, he tried to be even more definitive. “It will not be good for the two of us, as well as for the others, if we form a closer attachment. So, I am writing to you today for the last time and am submitting again to the inevitable, and you must do the same. You know that it is not hardness of heart or lack of feeling that makes me talk like this, because you know that, like you, I bear my cross without hope.”<sup><a id="filepos513729"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1706635">42</a></sup>

到了月底，他的语气愈加坚定。“倘若我们形成了更密切的依恋关系，对我们两人以及别人都不好。所以，我今天是最后一次给你写信了，再次听从命运的安排吧。你也必须如此行事。你要知道，我说这番话并非出于铁石心肠或缺乏感情，而是因为如你所知，我也和你一样，绝望地背负着我的十字架（指米列娃）。”

Einstein and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> shared one thing: a feeling that living among the middle-class German community in Prague had become wearisome. “These are not people with natural sentiments,” he told Besso. They displayed “a peculiar mixture of snobbery and servility, without any kind of goodwill toward their fellow men.” The water was un-drinkable, the air was full of soot, and an ostentatious luxury was juxtaposed with misery on the streets. But what offended Einstein most were the artificial class structures. “When I come to the institute,” he complained, “a servile man who smells of alcohol bows and says, ‘your most humble servant.’ ”<sup><a id="filepos514565"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1706802">43</a></sup>

爱因斯坦和米列娃都感到，生活在布拉格的中产阶级德国人中间已经变得令人厌倦。“这是一帮没有自然情感的人，”他告诉贝索，“他们奇特地集自视尊贵与奴颜媚骨于一身，对自己的同事毫无善意。”那里的水对身体有害，空气里充满了煤烟，街道上一边是炫耀卖弄的奢侈，一边是令人悚然的悲惨景象。但最令爱因斯坦不快的还是那种虚伪做作的阶层等级。“当我来到研究所，”他抱怨说，“一个侍者酒气熏天，点头哈腰地说，‘您最谦卑的仆人。’”

The Zurich Polytechnic, where Einstein and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> had blissfully shared their books and their souls, had been upgraded in June 1911 to a full university, now named the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH), or the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, with the right to grant graduate degrees. At 32 and by now quite famous in the world of theoretical physics, Einstein should have been an easy and obvious choice for one of the new professorships available there.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
苏黎世联邦工学院是爱因斯坦和米列娃的母校，他们曾在这里幸福地读书和交流思想。1911年6月，这所学院正式升格为大学，现在的名字是“苏黎世联邦理工大学”（Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule，简称ETH），有资格授予研究生学位。如今，32岁的爱因斯坦已经在理论物理学界享有盛名，他要想成为这里的教授应该很容易。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

That possibility had been discussed a year earlier. Before he left for Prague, Einstein had made a deal with officials in Zurich. “I promised in private that I would advise them before accepting another offer from somewhere else, so that the administration of the Polytechnic could also make me an offer if they find it fit to do so,” he told a Dutch professor who was trying to recruit him to Utrecht.<sup><a id="filepos516596"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707349">45</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


事实上，这种可能性一年前就已经讨论了。在搬到布拉格之前，爱因斯坦曾与苏黎世的主管部门达成协议。“我私下里曾经做过承诺，在我接受另一个地方的聘任之前我会告诉他们，这样，如果他们觉得合适，联邦工学院的行政部门也可以来聘任我。”他对一位邀请他到乌德勒支大学任教的荷兰教授说。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

By November 1911, Einstein had received such an offer from Zurich, or at least so he thought, and as a result he declined the offer to go to Utrecht. But the matter was not completely settled, because some of Zurich’s education officials objected. They argued that a professor in theoretical physics was a “luxury,” that there was not enough lab space to accommodate one, and that Einstein personally was not a good teacher.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
1911年11月，爱因斯坦的确收到了来自苏黎世的邀请，于是便谢绝了乌德勒支大学的好意。但事情其实并没有完全确定，因为苏黎世的一些教育官员持反对意见。他们认为，理论物理学教授是一种“奢侈”，太占用实验室空间，而且爱因斯坦本人也不是一个好教师。

Heinrich Zangger, a longtime friend who was a medical researcher in Zurich, intervened on Einstein’s behalf. “A proper theoretical physicist is a necessity these days,” he wrote in a letter to one of the top Swiss councilors. He also pointed out that in such a role Einstein “needs no laboratory.” As for Einstein’s teaching talents, Zangger provided a wonderfully nuanced and revealing description:

仓格尔是爱因斯坦的老朋友，在苏黎世大学做医学研究。他写信给一位瑞士高层官员，为爱因斯坦说情：“现在一个真正的理论物理学家是当务之需。”他还指出，这样一个职位“不需要实验室”。至于爱因斯坦的授课才能，仓格尔的描写生动细致而又发人深省：

He is not a good teacher for mentally lazy gentlemen who merely want to fill a notebook and then learn it by heart for an exam; he is not a <a id="filepos517850"></a>smooth talker, but anyone wishing to learn honestly how to develop his ideas in physics in an honest way, from deep within, and how to examine all premises carefully and see the pitfalls and the problems in his reflections, will find Einstein a first-class teacher, because all of this is expressed in his lectures, which force the audience to think along.<sup><a id="filepos518218"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707555">46</a></sup>

对于那些懒于思考的人来说，他不是一位好老师，因为这些人只想记笔记，然后通过死记硬背来应付考试；他是个不善辞令的人，但只要想知道如何才能诚实而深刻地提出物理学思想，如何才能慎重地考察所有前提，如何才能看清反思中的陷阱和问题，那么他就会发现，爱因斯坦是位一流的教师，因为所有这一切都表现在他的讲课中，它会促使听课的人一起思考。

Zangger wrote Einstein to express his outrage at the dithering in Zurich, and Einstein replied, “The dear Zurich folks can kiss my . . . [und die lieben Züricher können mich auch . . . (ellipses are in original letter)].” He told Zangger not to push the matter further. “Leave the Polytechnic<a id="filepos518650"></a><a href="Einstein_split_054.html#filepos2411954">*</a> to God’s inscrutable ways.”<sup><a id="filepos518730"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707808">47</a></sup>

仓格尔写信给爱因斯坦，表达了他对苏黎世主管部门优柔寡断的愤怒。爱因斯坦回信说：“亲爱的苏黎世人或许会……喜欢我（省略号是原信中的）。”他要仓格尔别再关注这件事。“让联邦工学院的事由上帝做出高深莫测的判决吧。”

Einstein, however, decided not to drop the matter but instead to push the Polytechnic through a light ruse. Officials at the university in Utrecht were just about to offer their open post to someone else, Peter Debye, when Einstein asked them to hold off. “I am turning to you with a strange request,” he wrote. The Zurich Polytechnic had initially seemed very eager to recruit him, he said, and it had been proceeding with haste out of fear that he would go to Utrecht. “But if they were to learn in the near future that Debye is going to Utrecht, they would lose their fervor at once and keep me forever in suspense. I ask you therefore to wait a little longer with the official offer to Debye.”<sup><a id="filepos519555"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707973">48</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
然而，爱因斯坦并没有放弃，而是耍了个小心眼来给联邦工学院施压。乌德勒支大学的主管部门正要把空出的职位授予另一个人，彼得·德拜，这时爱因斯坦要他们再等一段时间。“我向您提出一个奇怪的请求。”他写道。苏黎世联邦工学院最初似乎很想聘他，之所以急于办理，是因为担心他会去乌德勒支。“但是如果在不久的将来，他们知道德拜要去乌德勒支，定会热情顿消，从而使我总是心神不宁。因此我请您把正式聘请德拜一事再等一段时间。

Rather oddly, Einstein found himself needing letters of recommendation to secure a post at his own alma mater. Marie Curie wrote one. “In Brussels, where I attended a scientific conference in which Mr. Einstein also participated, I was able to admire the clarity of his intellect, the breadth of his information, and the profundity of his knowledge,” she noted.<sup><a id="filepos520032"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708135">49</a></sup>

很奇怪，爱因斯坦在母校谋职竟然需要推荐信。居里夫人写了一封推荐信。“在布鲁塞尔，爱因斯坦先生和我一起参加了一次科学会议，使我能够有机会欣赏他明晰的思想、见闻的广博和认识的深度。”她说。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Adding to the irony was that his other main letter of recommendation came from Henri Poincaré, the man who had almost come up with the special theory of relativity but still had not embraced it. Einstein was “one of the most original minds I have ever come across,” he said. Particularly poignant was his description of Einstein’s willingness, which Poincaré himself lacked, to make radical conceptual leaps: “What I admire in him in particular is the facility with which he adapts himself to new concepts. He does not remain attached to classical principles, and, when presented with a problem in physics, is prompt to envision all the possibilities.” Poincaré, however, could not resist asserting, perhaps with relativity in mind, that Einstein might not be right in all his theories: “Since he seeks in all directions one must expect the majority of the paths on which he embarks to be blind alleys.”<sup><a id="filepos521096"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708389">50</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
他的另一封主要推荐信是庞加莱写的。庞加莱几乎已经提出狭义相对论，但却没有迈出最后一步。他说，爱因斯坦是“我所见过的最有原创性思想的人之一”。特别鞭辟入里的是他对爱因斯坦试图做激进的概念飞跃（这是他本人所缺乏的）的描述：“我特别钦佩他适应新概念的能力。他并不固守于经典原理，在面对物理学问题时，能够立即设想出所有可能性。”不过庞加莱也认为（也许此时他想到的是相对论），爱因斯坦提出的理论并不一定样样都正确。“由于他的探索沿着各个方向进行，我们不得不预期他所走的许多道路都是死胡同。”

<a id="filepos521195"></a>Soon it all worked out. Einstein would move back to Zurich in July 1912. He thanked Zangger for helping him to prevail “against all odds,” and exulted, “I am enormously happy that we will be together again.” Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> was thrilled as well. She thought that the return could help save both her sanity and their marriage. Even the children seemed happy to be out of Prague and back to the city of their birth. As Einstein put it in a postcard to another friend,“Great joy about it among us old folks and the two bear cubs.”<sup><a id="filepos521799"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708661">51</a></sup>

不久，事情全都办妥了。爱因斯坦将于1912年7月返回苏黎世。他感谢仓格尔“顶着重重困难”帮他取得了胜利，并且欢呼说：“我们又能重新在一起了，真是幸福之至。”米列娃也很激动。她希望这次返乡能够帮她挽回健全的心智和幸福的婚姻。离开布拉格回到故土，孩子们也很高兴。爱因斯坦给朋友寄明信片说：“我们两个老家伙和两个小熊仔对此十分快乐。”

His departure caused a minor controversy in Prague. Newspaper articles noted that anti-Semitism at the university may have played a role. Einstein felt compelled to issue a public statement. “Despite all presumptions,” he said,“I did not feel and did not notice any religious prejudice.” The appointment of Philipp Frank, a Jew, as his successor, he added, confirmed that “such considerations”were not a major problem.<sup><a id="filepos522357"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708831">52</a></sup>

他的离职在布拉格掀起了一场不大不小的争论。报纸上称，大学中的反犹主义或许起了推波助澜的作用。爱因斯坦感到有必要发表一篇公开声明进行澄清。他说：“尽管有这些猜测，但我并没有感到，也没有注意到任何宗教偏见。”他还说，犹太人弗兰克被任命为他的继任者表明，“这方面的考虑，并不是主要问题。

Life in Zurich should have been glorious. The Einsteins were able to afford a modern six-room apartment with grand views. They were reunited with friends such as Zangger and Grossmann, and there was even one fewer adversary. “The fierce Weber has died, so it will be very pleasant from a personal point of view,” Einstein wrote of their undergraduate physics professor and nemesis, Heinrich Weber.<sup><a id="filepos522870"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1709197">53</a></sup>

Once again there were musical gatherings at the home of math professor Adolf Hurwitz.

She attended the Hurwitz recitals less frequently, and when she did show up her gloom was increasingly evident.

“There is no book on relativity that is comprehensible to the layman,” he replied. “But what do you have a relativity cousin for? If you ever happen to be in Zurich, then we (without my wife, who is unfortunately very jealous) will take a nice walk, and I will tell you about all of those curious things that I discovered.” Then he went a bit further. Instead of sending a picture, wouldn’t it be better to see each other in person? “If you wish to make me truly happy, then arrange to spend a few days here sometime.”<sup><a id="filepos525390"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1709859">56</a></sup>

A few days later, he wrote again, with word that he had instructed a photographer to send her a picture.

As he had a year earlier, he complained about being married to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>: “What I wouldn’t give to be able to spend a few days with you, but without my cross!” He asked Elsa if she would be in Berlin later that summer. “I would like to come for a short visit.”<sup><a id="filepos526022"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710025">57</a></sup>

It was therefore not surprising that Einstein was very receptive, a few months later, when the two towers of Berlin’s scientific establishment—Max Planck and Walther Nernst—came to Zurich with an enticing proposal. Having been impressed by Einstein at the Solvay Conference of 1911, they had already been sounding out colleagues about getting him to Berlin.

几个月后，柏林科学界的两位巨头普朗克和能斯特带着诱人的邀请来到苏黎世，爱因斯坦自然接待得十分殷勤。爱因斯坦在1911年索尔维会议上的表现给他们留下了深刻的印象。他们一直在派人打探他是否愿意到柏林工作。

<a id="filepos526553"></a>The offer they brought with them, when they arrived with their wives on the night train from Berlin on July 11, 1913, had three impressive components: Einstein would be elected to a coveted vacancy in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, which would come with a hefty stipend; he would become the director of a new physics institute; and he would be made a professor at the University of Berlin. The package included a lot of money, and it was not nearly as much work as it may have seemed on the surface. Planck and Nernst made it clear that Einstein would have no required teaching duties at the university and no real administrative tasks at the institute. And though he would be required to accept German citizenship once again, he could keep his Swiss citizenship as well.

1913年7月11日，普朗克和能斯特两对夫妇乘夜车从柏林赶到苏黎世。他们开出的条件有三点很诱人：爱因斯坦将被选为享有崇高声誉的普鲁士科学院的新增院士，薪水相当丰厚；他将担任一个新建的物理研究所的所长；还将成为柏林大学教授。这真是一个大礼包，而且似乎不需要做太多工作。普朗克和能斯特明确表示，他在大学没有硬性的教学任务，所里也没有什么行政差事。虽然他将获得德国国籍，但仍可以保留其瑞士国籍。

The visitors made their case during a long visit to Einstein’s sunny office at the Polytechnic. He said he needed a few hours to think it over, though it is likely he knew he would accept. So Planck and Nernst took their wives on an excursion by funicular railway up one of the nearby mountains. With puckish amusement, Einstein told them he would be awaiting their return to the station with a signal. If he had decided to decline, he would be carrying a white rose, and if he was going to accept, a red rose (some accounts have the signal being a white handkerchief). When they stepped off the train, they happily discovered that he had accepted.<sup><a id="filepos528050"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710187">58</a></sup>

在联邦工学院那间窗明几净的办公室里，他们说明了来意，苦口婆心地进行劝说。虽然爱因斯坦知道自己很可能会接受，但还是说需要花几小时好好想一想。于是普朗克和能斯特携妻子乘缆车到附近的山里游览。爱因斯坦恶作剧式地告诉他们，他到车站去接时将带着暗号。如果拒绝，他会拿一朵白玫瑰（有人说暗号是一块白手帕），如果接受，则会拿一朵红玫瑰。当普朗克和能斯特一行走出车门时，他们欣喜地发现，爱因斯坦接受了邀请。

That meant that Einstein would become, at 34, the youngest member of the Prussian Academy. But first Planck had to get him elected. The letter he wrote, which was also signed by Nernst and others, had the memorable but incorrect concession, quoted earlier, that “he might sometimes have overshot the target in his speculations, as for example in his light quantum hypothesis.” But the rest of the letter was suffused with extravagant praise for each of his many scientific contributions. “Among the great problems abundant in modern physics, there is hardly one to which Einstein has not made a remarkable contribution.”<sup><a id="filepos528798"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710619">59</a></sup>

这意味着34岁的爱因斯坦将会成为普鲁士科学院最年轻的院士。但首先普朗克必须使他能够当选。普朗克起草了一封信，能斯特等人在上面签了名。虽然像前面引用过的那样，这封信就爱因斯坦的科学贡献给出了一些不够准确的评价，“有时候他可能思辨过了火，比如他的光量子假说就是如此”，但通篇对他的诸多科学贡献大加赞赏。“在现代物理学如此丰富的重要问题中，爱因斯坦几乎对每一个都有重大贡献。”

The Berliners were taking a risk, Einstein realized. He was being recruited not for his teaching skills (as he would not be teaching), nor for his administrative ones. And even though he had been publishing outlines and papers describing his ongoing efforts to generalize relativity, <a id="filepos529181"></a>it was unclear whether he would succeed in that quest. “The Germans are gambling on me as they would on a prize-winning hen,” he told a friend as they were leaving a party, “but I don’t know if I can still lay eggs.”<sup><a id="filepos529439"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710854">60</a></sup>

爱因斯坦意识到，这些柏林人这样做是有风险的。他被选上不是因为教学技巧（因为他将不用教课），也不是因为管理能力。虽然他一直在发表文章和论文解释如何推广相对论，但连他本人也不清楚这项工作是否会取得成功。“德国人正在把我当成可以获奖下蛋的母鸡，”他对一个朋友说，“但我不知道自己是否还能下蛋。”

Einstein, likewise, was taking a risk. He had a secure and lucrative post in a city and society that he, his wife, and his family loved. The Swiss personality agreed with him. His wife had a Slav’s revulsion for all things Teutonic, and he had a similar distaste that had been in-grained in childhood. As a boy he had run away from Prussian-accented parades and Germanic rigidity. Only the opportunity to be gloriously coddled in the world capital of science could have compelled him to make such a move.

爱因斯坦同样也在冒险。他和家人都很热爱现在这个城市，而且工作稳定，收入可观。瑞士人的性格和他很对路。作为斯拉夫人，他的妻子对一切日耳曼事物都心存厌恶。他本人也有一种类似的反感，童年时就已扎根。对于那种具有普鲁士特色的阅兵式，少年时代的他就恐避之不及，德国人的僵化刻板也使他厌恶。只有在科学之都得到如此礼遇，才可能驱使他搬离此处。

Einstein found the prospect thrilling and a bit amusing. “I am going to Berlin as an Academy-man without any obligations, rather like a living mummy,” he wrote fellow physicist Jakob Laub. “I’m already looking forward to this difficult career!”<sup><a id="filepos530384"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710993">61</a></sup> To Ehrenfest he admitted, “I accepted this odd sinecure because giving lectures gets on my nerves.”<sup><a id="filepos530543"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711152">62</a></sup> However, to the venerable Hendrik Lorentz in Holland Einstein displayed more gravitas: “I could not resist the temptation to accept a position in which I am relieved of all responsibilities so that I can give myself over completely to rumination.”<sup><a id="filepos530850"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711316">63</a></sup>

在爱因斯坦看来，新的前景令人振奋，也有些可笑。“我将到柏林任科学院院士而不承担任何义务，活像一尊木乃伊，”他写信给物理学家雅各布·劳伯说，“我倒希望从事这样一种困难的行当！” 在给埃伦菲斯特的信中他承认，“我接受这份奇特的闲职，是因为讲课常使我精神紧张。” 不过，对荷兰德高望重的洛伦兹，他却表达得很严肃：“我抵挡不住就任新职的诱惑，因为那样一来，我就可以摆脱一切责任，全身心地投入到沉思默想之中。”

The same evening that Planck and Nernst left Zurich, Einstein wrote Elsa an excited letter describing the “colossal honor” they had offered. “Next spring at the latest, I’ll come to Berlin for good,” he exulted. “I already rejoice at the wonderful times we will spend together!”

During the ensuing week, he sent two more such notes. “I rejoice at the thought that I will soon be coming to you,” he wrote in the first. And a few days later: “Now we will be together and rejoice in each other!” It is impossible to know for sure what relative weight to assign to each of the factors enticing him to Berlin: the unsurpassed scientific community there, the glories and perks of the post he was offered, or the chance to be with Elsa. But at least to her he claimed it was primarily <a id="filepos532193"></a>the latter. “I look forward keenly to Berlin, mainly because I look forward to <em>you.</em>”<sup><a id="filepos532310"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711721">65</a></sup>

在接下来的一周，他又发出了两封这样的信。“一想到我将很快来到你处，就感到欢欣鼓舞。”第一封信这样写道。几天后他又说：“不久我们就可以在一起了，让我们共同欢呼吧！”对于吸引他到柏林的几个因素：无与伦比的科学群体，所获职位的荣耀和好处，有机会与爱尔莎待在一起……我们不可能确切知道它们孰轻孰重，至少他对爱尔莎说主要是因为后者。“我热切期望去柏林，主要是因为想见你。”

Elsa had actually tried to help him get the offer. Earlier in the year, on her own initiative, she had dropped in on Fritz Haber, who ran the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Chemistry in Berlin, and let him know that her cousin might be open to a position that would bring him to Berlin. When he learned of Elsa’s intervention, Einstein was amused. “Haber knows who he is dealing with. He knows how to appreciate the influence of a friendly female cousin . . . The nonchalance with which you dropped in on Haber is pure Elsa. Did you tell anyone about it, or did you consult only with your wicked heart? If only I could have looked on!”<sup><a id="filepos533064"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711916">66</a></sup>

事实上，在这一过程中爱尔莎也助了他一臂之力。不久前，她曾主动拜访了主管柏林威廉皇帝化学研究所的哈伯，告知她的表弟可能会接受一个柏林的职位。在听说爱尔莎的这一行为之后，爱因斯坦非常高兴。“哈伯知道他在和谁打交道。他懂得如何评估一位友好的女性老朋友的影响……你若无其事地去拜访哈伯是典型的爱尔莎（风格）。你没有把此事告诉别人吧？或者你仅和自己顽劣的内心商量过？要是我能旁观该多好！”

Even before Einstein moved to Berlin, he and Elsa began to correspond as if they were a couple.

甚至在搬到柏林之前，爱因斯坦和爱尔莎就已经开始通信，宛如一对夫妻。爱尔莎担心爱因斯坦疲劳过度，寄给他一封长信，提醒他应该多多锻炼和休息，注意健康饮食。他则回信说，他打算“吸烟像烟囱，工作像骡马，饮食无所顾忌不加选择，至于散步，只有有了真正合宜的同伴才愿意进行”。

Indeed, even amid his flurry of love letters with Elsa, Einstein was still trying to be a suitable family man. For his August 1913 vacation, he decided to take his wife and two sons hiking with Marie Curie and her two daughters. The plan was to go through the mountains of southeastern Switzerland down to Lake Como, where he and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> had spent their most passionate and romantic moments twelve years earlier.

的确，甚至在与爱尔莎的鸿雁传情中，爱因斯坦也试图做一个真正的居家男人。1913年暑假，他决定带妻子和两个儿子与居里夫人及其两个女儿一同徒步旅行，穿过瑞士东南部的山脉抵达科莫湖。12年前，他曾和米列娃在那里度过了最为激情和浪漫的时光。

As it turned out, the sickly Eduard was unable to make the trip, and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> stayed behind for a few days to get him settled with friends. Then she joined them as they neared Lake Como. During the hikes, Curie challenged Einstein to name all the peaks. They also talked science, especially when the children ran ahead. At one point Einstein stopped suddenly and grabbed Curie’s arm. “You understand, what I need to know is exactly what happens to the passengers in an elevator when it falls into emptiness,” he said, referring to his ideas about the <a id="filepos534989"></a>equivalence of gravity and acceleration. As Curie’s daughter noted later, “Such a touching preoccupation made the younger generation roar with laughter.”<sup><a id="filepos535172"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1712271">68</a></sup>

然而，爱德华因患病而无法远行，米列娃留下来与朋友们一同照看，数天之后在他们快到科莫湖时才加入。旅行期间，居里夫人曾要爱因斯坦说出所有山峰的名字。他们也讨论科学，特别是当孩子们在别处玩耍时。有一次爱因斯坦忽然停住脚步，抓起居里夫人的胳膊。“你知道，我需要弄清楚的恰恰就是当升降机从空中落下时其中的乘客会怎么样。”他指的是关于引力与加速的等效原理。居里夫人的女儿后来说：“这样一种动人的全神贯注使他们年轻人乐不可支。

Einstein then accompanied Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> and their children to visit her family in Novi Sad and at their summer house in Ka<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. On their final Sunday in Serbia, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> took the children, without her husband, to be baptized. Hans Albert remembered later the beautiful singing; his brother, Eduard, only 3, was disruptive. As for their father, he seemed sanguine and bemused afterward. “Do you know what the result is?” he told Hurwitz.“They’ve turned Catholic.

随后，爱因斯坦一家去了米列娃在诺维萨德的家，还去了米列娃的家人在卡奇（Ka)村的避暑别墅。在塞尔维亚的最后一个星期天，米列娃独自带孩子们去受洗了。汉斯•阿尔伯特后来回忆说，自己当时听到了美妙的歌声，3岁的弟弟爱德华则只顾捣乱。至于他们的父亲，倒是显得很乐观，随后又有些茫然无措。“你知道结果如何吗？”他对胡尔维茨说，“他们成了天主教徒。好吧，这对我来说都一样。”

The façade of familial harmony, however, masked the deterioration of the marriage. After his visit to Serbia and a stop in Vienna for his annual appearance at the conference of German-speaking physicists, Einstein continued on to Berlin, alone. There he was reunited with Elsa. “I now have someone I can think about with pure delight and I can live for,” he told her.<sup><a id="filepos536396"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1712886">70</a></sup>

Elsa’s home cooking, a hearty pleasure she lavished on him like a mother, became a theme in their letters. Their correspondence, like their relationship, was a stark contrast to that between Einstein and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> a dozen years earlier. He and Elsa tended to write to each other about domestic comforts—food, tranquillity, hygiene, fondness—rather than about romantic bliss and planted kisses, or intimacies of the soul and insights of the intellect.

爱尔莎的拿手好菜成了他们通信的一个主题。这与十几年前他同米列娃的通信和关系形成了鲜明对照。他与爱尔莎写信谈论的都是食物、安宁、保健、喜好等居家琐事，而不是卿卿我我地分享爱情的甜美，交流灵魂的愉悦和思想的洞见。

Despite such conventional concerns, Einstein still fancied their relationship could avoid sinking into a mundane pattern. “How nice it would be if one of these days we could share in managing a small bohemian household,” he wrote. “You have no idea how charming such a life with very small needs and without grandeur can be!”<sup><a id="filepos537409"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713048">71</a></sup> When Elsa gave him a hairbrush, he initially prided himself on his progress in personal grooming, but then he reverted to more slovenly ways and told her, only half jokingly, that it was to guard against the philistines and the bourgeoisie.

尽管关心着这些俗事，爱因斯坦仍然幻想着他们的关系能够免于落入俗套。“要是在这些天中的某一天，我们能够不落俗套地操持一下家务，那该多好！”他写道，“你还不懂得摈除奢华，崇尚简朴的生活是多么美好！” 爱尔莎送给他一把梳子，他一开始还自鸣得意，认为自己在个人打理方面已经进步不小，但很快就回到了更邋遢的样子。他半开玩笑地告诉爱尔莎，这是为了防范庸俗和小资。这些话他也曾用在米列娃身上，只是更为诚恳。

Elsa wanted not only to domesticate Einstein but to marry him. Even before he moved to Berlin, she wrote to urge him to divorce Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. It would become a running battle for years, until she finally won <a id="filepos538097"></a>her way. But for the moment, Einstein was resistant. “Do you think,” he asked her, “it is so easy to get a divorce if one does not have any proof of the other party’s guilt?” She should accept that he had virtually separated from Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> even if he was not going to divorce her. “I treat my wife as an employee whom I cannot fire. I have my own bedroom and avoid being alone with her.” Elsa was upset that Einstein did not want to marry her, and she was fearful of how an illicit relationship would affect her daughters, but Einstein insisted it was for the best.<sup><a id="filepos538751"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713210">72</a></sup>

爱尔莎不仅希望使爱因斯坦就范，而且想嫁给他。甚至在爱因斯坦搬到柏林之前，她就写信敦促他跟米列娃离婚。就这样，一场旷日持久的斗争开始了，直至她最终取得胜利。但在目前，爱因斯坦还不同意。“如果一方不掌握对方罪责的证据，”他问道，“你认为离婚很容易吗？”虽然他不准备与米列娃离婚，但实际上已经分居，这一点爱尔莎应当接受。“我对待妻子就像对待一个不能解雇的职员，我有自己的卧室，避免和她单独在一起。”爱尔莎对爱因斯坦不想娶她很是沮丧，而且担心这种不正当的关系会对她的两个女儿产生影响，但爱因斯坦坚持说，结果最终会让人满意的。

In addition, Berlin had sometimes been less tolerant to Slavs than it was even to Jews. “My wife whines to me incessantly about Berlin and her fear of the relatives,” Einstein wrote Elsa. “Well, there is some truth in this.” In another letter, when he noted that Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> was afraid of her, he added, “Rightly so I hope!”<sup><a id="filepos539504"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713378">73</a></sup>

Indeed, by this point all of the women in his life—his mother, sister, wife, and kissing cousin—were at war with one another. As Christmas 1913 neared, Einstein’s struggle to generalize relativity had the added benefit of being a way to avoid family emotions. The effort produced yet another eloquent restatement of how science could rescue him from the merely personal. “The love of science thrives under these circumstances,” he told Elsa, “for it lifts me impersonally from the vale of tears into peaceful spheres.”<sup><a id="filepos540168"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713558">74</a></sup>

The tensions in Einstein’s domestic life were exacerbated by overwork and mental strain. He was settling into a new job—actually three new jobs—and still struggling with his fitful attempts to generalize his theory of relativity and tie it into a theory of gravity. That first April in Berlin, for example, he engaged in an intense correspondence with Paul Ehrenfest over ways to calculate the forces affecting rotating electrons in a magnetic field. He started writing a theory for such situations, then realized it was wrong. “The angel had unveiled itself halfway in its magnificence,” he told Ehrenfest, “then on further unveiling a cloven hoof appeared and I ran away.”

Even more revealing, perhaps more than he meant it to be, was his comment to Ehrenfest about his personal life in Berlin.“I really delight in my local relatives,” he reported, “especially in a cousin of my age.”<sup><a id="filepos542715"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1714153">77</a></sup>

When Ehrenfest came for a visit at the end of April, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> had just arrived, and he found her gloomy and yearning for Zurich. Einstein, on the other hand, had thrown himself into his work. “He had the impression that the family was taking a bit too much of his time, and that he had the duty to concentrate completely on his work,” his son Hans Albert later recollected about that fateful spring of 1914.<sup><a id="filepos543274"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1714394">78</a></sup>

4月底，米列娃到达柏林。来访的埃伦菲斯特觉察到她的忧郁和对苏黎世的思念。爱因斯坦却全身心投入到工作中。“他有一种印象认为，家庭占用了他太多的时间，他有责任完全专注于工作。”儿子汉斯·阿尔伯特后来这样回忆灾难性的1914年春天。

Personal relationships involve nature’s most mysterious forces. Outside judgments are easy to make and hard to verify. Einstein repeatedly and plaintively stressed to all of their mutual friends—especially the Bessos, Habers, and Zanggers—that they should try to see the breakup of his marriage from his perspective, despite his own apparent culpability.

夫妻关系涉及一些最神秘的自然力量。有很多闲言碎语，但都很难证实。爱因斯坦曾多次向他的朋友——特别是贝索夫妇、哈伯夫妇和仓格尔夫妇——痛心疾首地说，他们将会见证他的婚姻破裂，尽管他自己无疑负有责任。

It is probably true that he was not solely to blame. The decline of the marriage was a downward spiral. He had become emotionally withdrawn, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> had become more depressed and dark, and each action reinforced the other. Einstein tended to avoid painful personal emotions by immersing himself in his work. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, for her part, <a id="filepos544207"></a>was bitter about the collapse of her own dreams and increasingly resentful of her husband’s success. Her jealousy made her hostile toward anyone else who was close to Einstein, including his mother (the feeling was reciprocal) and his friends. Her mistrustful nature was, understandably, to some extent an effect of Einstein’s detachment, but it was also a cause.

也许需要责备的不仅仅是他一个人。婚姻的破裂是一个盘旋下行的螺线。在感情上，他已经变得内向而孤僻，米列娃则变得更加冷漠和阴郁，双方互相影响。爱因斯坦通过投入到工作中来避免个人感情的伤痛，米列娃则苦于个人梦想的破灭，愈发怨恨丈夫的成功。她的嫉妒使她对任何与爱因斯坦亲近的人都心生敌意，甚至是他的妈妈（感情是相互的）和朋友。在一定程度上，她那不信任的性情固然是由爱因斯坦的冷漠引发的，但它本身也是一个原因。

By the time they moved to Berlin, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> had developed at least one personal involvement of her own, with a mathematics professor in Zagreb named Vladimir Vari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>ak, who had challenged Einstein’s interpretations of how special relativity applied to a rotating disk. Einstein was aware of the situation. “He had a kind of relationship with my wife, which can’t be held against either of them,” he wrote to Zangger in June. “It only made me feel my sense of isolation doubly painfully.”<sup><a id="filepos545246"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1714527">79</a></sup>

搬到柏林之后，米列娃至少与萨格勒布的一位数学教授弗拉基米尔·瓦里查克保持着暧昧关系，后者曾经挑战过爱因斯坦对狭义相对论应用于旋转圆盘的解释。爱因斯坦对这一情况心知肚明。“他与我的妻子关系暧昧，不能因此而怨恨他们中的任何一方，”他6月给仓格尔写信说，“它只能使我愈加痛苦地感到孤独。”

The end came in July. Amid the turmoil, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> moved with her two boys into the house of Fritz Haber, the chemist who’d recruited Einstein and who ran the institute where his office was located. Haber had his own experience with domestic discord. His wife, Clara, would end up committing suicide the following year after a fight over Haber’s participation in the war. But for the time being, she was Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>’s only friend in Berlin, and Fritz Haber became the intermediary as the Einsteins’ battles broke into the open.

Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> accepted the terms. When Haber delivered her response, Einstein insisted on writing to her again “so that you are completely clear about the situation.” He was prepared to live together again “because I don’t want to lose the children and I don’t want them to lose me.” It was out of the question that he would have a “friendly” relationship with her, but he would aim for a “businesslike” one. “The personal aspects must be reduced to a tiny remnant,” he said. “In return, I assure you of proper comportment on my part, such as I would exercise to any woman as a stranger.”<sup><a id="filepos549090"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715146">81</a></sup>

米列娃接受了这些条款。当哈伯转达了她的回应之后，爱因斯坦又给她写了一封信，“以便你完全明白目前的形势”。之所以准备重新住在一起，是“因为我不愿失去孩子们，也不愿他们失去我”。“和睦的”关系是不大可能达成了，但他还是打算保持一种“事务性的”关系。“个人方面必须缩小到很小一个范围，”他说，“不过我为此向你保证，我会以恰当的态度对待你，就好像我面对的是一个陌生女人。”

Only then did Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> realize that the relationship was not salvageable. They all met at Haber’s house on a Friday to work out a separation agreement. It took three hours. Einstein agreed to provide Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> and his children 5,600 marks a year, just under half of his primary salary. Haber and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> went to a lawyer to have the contract drawn up; Einstein did not accompany them, but instead sent his friend Michele Besso, who had come from Trieste to represent him.<sup><a id="filepos549779"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715362">82</a></sup>

直到这时米列娃才意识到，他们的关系已经无法挽回。他们于一个星期五到哈伯家会合，花了三小时拟出了一份分居协议。爱因斯坦同意每年给米列娃和孩子们提供5600马克，这只占其基本工资的一半。哈伯和米列娃到律师那里签订这份协议；爱因斯坦并没有同往，而是让从的里雅斯特赶来的朋友贝索代表他。

Einstein left the meeting at Haber’s house and went directly to the home of Elsa’s parents, who were also his aunt and uncle. They arrived home late from dinner to find him there, and they received the news about the situation with “a mild distaste.” Nevertheless, he ended up staying at their house. Elsa was on summer vacation in the Bavarian Alps with her two daughters, and Einstein wrote to inform her that he was now sleeping in her bed in the apartment upstairs. “It’s peculiar how confusingly sentimental one gets,” he told her. “It is just a bed like any other, as though you had never slept in it. And yet I find it comforting.” <a id="filepos550571"></a>She had invited him to visit her in the Bavarian Alps, but he said he could not, “for fear of damaging your reputation again.”<sup><a id="filepos550721"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715634">83</a></sup>

爱因斯坦从哈伯家出来，径直到了爱尔莎的父母（也是他的姨妈和姨父）家。由于外出参加晚宴，他们很晚才回到家。他们得知这一消息时“心里有些不悦”，但还是让他住下来了。此时，爱尔莎和两个女儿正在巴伐利亚阿尔卑斯山区避暑，爱因斯坦写信给她说，他现在正睡在楼上她的床上。“真是奇怪，使人觉得这般困惑，”他告诉爱尔莎，“这张床与别的床没有什么不同，就好像你从未躺在上面睡过一样，但我觉得它很舒服。”此前爱尔莎曾邀请他到阿尔卑斯山来看她，但他说他不能，“因为担心再次破坏你的名声”。

The way to a divorce had now been paved, he assured Elsa, and he called it “a sacrifice” he had made on her behalf. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> would move back to Zurich and take custody of the two boys, and when they came to visit their father they could meet only on “neutral ground,” not in any house he shared with Elsa. “This is justified,” Einstein conceded to Elsa, “because it is not right to have the children see their father with a woman other than their own mother.”

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
他向爱尔莎保证，离婚已经箭在弦上，并称这是为她做的“一种牺牲”。米列娃将会搬回苏黎世照看两个儿子。当他们来看望父亲时，会在一个“中性地带点”，而不会在他与爱尔莎的住处见面。“这很合理，”爱因斯坦向爱尔莎承认，“因为让孩子们看到他们的爸爸和一个并非他们妈妈的女人在一起是不合适的。”

The prospect of parting with his children was devastating for Einstein. He pretended to be detached from personal sentiments, and sometimes he was. But he became deeply emotional as he imagined life apart from his sons. “I would be a real monster if I felt any other way,” he wrote Elsa. “I have carried these children around innumerable times day and night, taken them out in their pram, played with them, romped around and joked with them. They used to shout with joy when I came; the little one cheered even now, because he was still too small to grasp the situation. Now they will be gone forever, and their image of their father is being spoiled.”<sup><a id="filepos552101"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715796">84</a></sup>

与孩子们分开使爱因斯坦心痛万分。他表现得好像对个人感情很超脱，有时也的确如此。但每当他想起儿子们不在身边的生活时，就会变得很动情。“倘若我的感受不是如此，那我就真是个怪物，”他对爱尔莎说，“我曾经在无数个日日夜夜抱着这两个孩子，或者用婴儿车推着他们到处走，同他们游戏，爬上爬下，嬉戏逗乐。以前我一出现他们便要欢呼，小儿子直到现在也还会欢呼，因为他太小了，不可能明白眼前的情况。现在他们将一去不复返了，而在他们的脑海里，父亲的形象正在被销蚀！”

Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> and the two boys left Berlin, accompanied by Michele Besso, aboard the morning train to Zurich on Wednesday, July 29, 1914. Haber went to the station with Einstein, who “bawled like a little boy” all afternoon and evening. It was the most wrenching personal moment for a man who took perverse pride in avoiding personal moments. For all of his reputation of being inured to deep human attachments, he had been madly in love with Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> and bonded to his children. For one of the few times in his adult life, he found himself crying.

She even professed herself pleased for Elsa, although they had occasionally clashed. And Elsa’s mother and father also seemed happy enough with the resolution, though they did express resentment that Einstein had been too financially generous to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, which meant the income left for him and Elsa might be “a bit meager.”<sup><a id="filepos553532"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715964">85</a></sup>

第二天，他看望了母亲保莉妮，心里好受了一些。保莉妮从来没有喜欢过米列娃，对她的离去很高兴。“哦，要是我们可怜的爸爸能够亲眼见到就好了！”保莉妮在谈到分居时说。保莉妮甚至说她对爱尔莎很满意，尽管她们偶尔有过不和。爱尔莎的母亲（保莉妮的姐姐）和父亲似乎也对事情的了结感到高兴，只是同时也表达了不满，即爱因斯坦对米列娃在经济上过于大方了，这意味着留给他和爱尔莎的收入要“少一些”。

Thus he would not have to force the issue of a legal divorce, which Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> fiercely resisted. Elsa, still on vacation, was “bitterly disappointed” by the news. Einstein sought to reassure her. “For me there is no other female creature besides you,” he wrote. “It is not a lack of true affection which scares me away again and again from marriage! Is it a fear of the comfortable life, of nice furniture, of the odium that I burden myself with or even of becoming some sort of contented bourgeois? I myself don’t know; but you will see that my attachment to you will endure.”

整个事件使爱因斯坦精疲力竭，他决定不准备再婚了，尽管一个多星期前他曾对爱尔莎说过相反的话。这样他不必正式离婚，这是米列娃强烈反对的。这个消息使正在度假的爱尔莎“失望之至”。爱因斯坦试图打消她的疑虑。“对我而言，除你之外再也不存在另一位女性，”他写道，“我之所以会对结婚一再望而却步，并非因为我缺少真正的感情！我是不是对舒适的生活、对漂亮的家具、对自己招来的憎恨，甚或对变成某种贪图安逸的中产阶级感到恐惧？我自己都不清楚。不过你会看到，我将永远忠实于你。”

He insisted that she should not feel ashamed or let people pity her for consorting with a man who would not marry her. They would take walks together and be there for each other. Should she choose to offer even more, he would be grateful. But by not marrying, they would be protecting themselves from lapsing into a “contented bourgeois” existence and preventing their relationship “from becoming banal and from growing pale.” To him, marriage was confining, which was a state he instinctively resisted. “I’m glad our delicate relationship does not have to founder on a provincial narrow-minded lifestyle.”<sup><a id="filepos555162"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1716241">86</a></sup>

他坚称，她不应当因为与一个不与她结婚的男人为伍而感到羞耻，或者让人可怜她。他们将在一起散步，并且相互支持。如果她能付出更多，他将心存感激。但不结婚将使他们不致沧为“贪图安逸的中产阶级”，防止他们的关系“变得平庸乏味”。在他看来，婚姻只能起限制作用，这是他本能抗拒的。“我高兴的是，我们之间温情脉脉的关系不必堕落为小市民的庸俗习气。”

曾几何时，作为灵魂伴侣的米列娃恰恰能够对这种不拘于传统的观点产生共鸣。爱尔莎不是这样的人，吸引她的是一种舒适安逸的生活，婚姻也是如此。不结婚的决定她可以接受一时，但不能接受一世。
