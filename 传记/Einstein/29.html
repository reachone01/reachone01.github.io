<h3><span><strong><em>Arms Control</em> 军备控制</strong></span></h3>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For a few weeks after the dropping of the atom bomb, Einstein was uncharacteristically reticent. He fended off reporters who were knocking at his door in Saranac Lake, and he even declined to give a quote to his summer neighbor Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of the <em>New York Times,</em> when he called.<sup><a id="filepos1358720"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1933614">1</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在原子弹投下之后的几个星期里，爱因斯坦异常地沉默寡言。他回绝了那些找上门来的记者，甚至当他的邻居——《纽约时报》的出版人亚瑟·海斯·萨尔兹伯格打来电话时，他也拒不发表任何评论。 



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>It was only as he was about to leave his summer rental in mid-September, more than a month after the bombs had been dropped, that Einstein agreed to discuss the issue with a wire service reporter who came calling. The point he stressed was that the bomb reinforced his longtime support for world federalism. “The only salvation for civilization and the human race lies in the creation of world government,” he said. “As long as sovereign states continue <a id="filepos1359290"></a>to have armaments and armaments secrets, new world wars will be inevitable.”<sup><a id="filepos1359384"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1934136">2</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
直到9月中旬准备离开租住的避暑别墅时，也就是在投掷原子弹一个多月以后，爱因斯坦才同意跟一位来访的通讯社记者谈论这一事件。他强调，原子弹强化了他长期以来对某种世界联邦制的支持。“文明和人类获救的唯一出路在于创建一个世界政府，”他说，“只要主权国家继续拥有各自的军备和武器秘密，新的世界大战就不可避免。” 


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>As in science, so it was in world politics for Einstein: he sought a unified set of principles that could create order out of anarchy. A system based on sovereign nations with their own military forces, competing ideologies, and conflicting national interests would inevitably produce more wars. So he regarded a world authority as realistic rather than idealistic, as practical rather than naïve.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>





和科学一样，爱因斯坦也试图从世界政治中找到一套统一的原则，以摆脱无政府状态，重新建立起秩序。如果各个主权国家都有其自身的军事力量、相互竞争的意识形态和彼此冲突的国家利益，那么在这个基础上建立起来的体系将不可避免地导致更多的战争。因此，他认为建立一个世界权力机构不是空想而是现实，不是幼稚而是实际。


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>He had been circumspect during the war years. He was a refugee in a nation that was using its military might for noble rather than nationalistic goals. But the end of the war changed things. So did the dropping of the atom bombs. The increase in the destructive power of offensive weaponry led to a commensurate increase in the need to find a world structure for security. It was time for him to become politically outspoken again.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在战争年代，爱因斯坦一直比较慎重。作为难民，他所在的国家动用武力是出于崇高的目的，而不是为了国家主义。然而原子弹的投掷和战争的结束改变了一切。随着进攻性武器的破坏力越来越大，建立一个世界组织来保证人类的安全也变得愈发迫切。爱因斯坦在这个时候再次就政治发表看法，可谓恰逢其时。


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>For the remaining ten years of his life, his passion for advocating a unified governing structure for the globe would rival that for finding a unified field theory that could govern all the forces of nature. Although distinct in most ways, both quests reflected his instincts for transcendent order. In addition, both would display Einstein’s willingness to be a nonconformist, to be serenely secure in challenging prevailing attitudes.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在生命的最后十年里，爱因斯坦不仅积极探索着一种能够支配所有自然力的统一场论，而且热情地提倡在全世界建立一个统一的政府组织。尽管在许多方面迥然不同，但这两种追求都反映了他向往超越秩序的本能，也展现了他甘当反叛者、希望自由挑战流行观点的典型意愿。



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The month after the bombs were dropped, a group of scientists signed a statement urging that a council of nations be created to control atomic weaponry. Einstein responded with a letter to J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had so successfully led the scientific efforts at Los Alamos. He was pleased with the sentiments behind the statement, Einstein said, but he criticized the political recommendations as “obviously inadequate” because they retained sovereign nations as the ultimate powers. “It is unthinkable that we can have peace without a real governmental organization to create and enforce law on individuals in their international relations.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在原子弹投掷之后的那个月，一些科学家签署了一份声明，旨在敦促政府创建一个国家顾问委员会来控制核武器。作为回应，爱因斯坦给曾经成功地领导了洛斯阿拉莫斯科学项目的奥本海默写了一封信。爱因斯坦说，他理解这份声明背后的情感，但认为这种政治谏言“显然不能胜任”，因为它们仍然把主权国家保留下来作为最终的政治力量。“如果没有一个真正凌驾于各国之上的政府组织来指导国际关系，实现和平是不可想象的。”


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Oppenheimer politely pointed out that “the statements you attributed to me are not mine.” They had been written by another group of scientists. He did, nevertheless, challenge Einstein’s argument for a full-fledged world government: “The history of this nation up through <a id="filepos1361951"></a>the Civil War shows how difficult the establishment of a federal authority can be when there are profound differences in the values of the societies it attempts to integrate.”<sup><a id="filepos1362144"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1934349">3</a></sup> Oppenheimer thus became the first of many postwar realists to disparage Einstein for being allegedly too idealistic. Of course, one could flip his argument by noting that the Civil War showed in gruesome terms the danger of <em>not</em> having a secure federal authority instead of state military sovereignty when there are differences of values among member states.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


奥本海默客气地指出：“你归之于我的这份声明并非出自我之手。”它是另一群科学家写的。不过，他对爱因斯坦关于一个正式的世界政府的主张提出了挑战。“这个国家自南北战争以来的历史表明，当它试图去整合的社会价值带有深刻差异时，建立一种联邦政府是何等困难。” 于是，奥本海默成为战后第一位批评爱因斯坦过于理想主义的现实主义者。当然，如果人们注意到，南北战争恰恰可怕地表明，当成员国（州）之间存在着价值差异时，只有国家（州）军事主权而没有一个稳固的联邦政府会相当危险，那么奥本海默的论证可以一带而过。

</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>What Einstein envisioned was a world “government” or “authority” that had a monopoly on military power. He called it a “supranational” entity, rather than an “international” one, because it would exist <em>above</em> its member nations rather than as a mediator among sovereign nations.<sup><a id="filepos1362948"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1934649">4</a></sup> The United Nations, which was founded in October 1945, did not come close to meeting these criteria, Einstein felt.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦所设想的是一个可以垄断军事力量的世界“政府”或“权力机构”，他称之为“超国家”组织而非“国际”组织，因为它将凌驾于其成员国之上，而不是充当各个主权国家的调停者。它所扮演的角色将严格限制在军事和国际关系上，而不是一个国家的内政。只有在人权遭到严重侵犯的地方（他当然想到了纳粹德国），这个超国家的政府才有权介入一个国家的内部事务。 



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Over the next few months, Einstein fleshed out his proposals in a series of essays and interviews. The most important arose from an exchange of fan letters he had with Raymond Gram Swing, a commentator on ABC radio. Einstein invited Swing to visit him in Princeton, and the result was an article by Einstein, as told to Swing, in the November 1945 issue of the <em>Atlantic</em> called “Atomic War or Peace.”<sup><a id="filepos1363587"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1935419">5</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

在接下来的几个月里，爱因斯坦继续在一系列短文和访谈中发出倡议。其中最重要的一篇文章源自他与美国广播公司的晚间新闻评论员雷蒙德·格拉姆·斯温的通信。爱因斯坦邀请斯温来普林斯顿访问，他向斯温口述的内容以“要原子战争还是要和平”为题发表在1945年11月的《大西洋月刊》上。 


</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>The three great powers—the United States, Britain, and Russia—should jointly establish the new world government, Einstein said in the article, and then invite other nations to join. Using a somewhat misleading phrase that was part of the popular debate of the time, he said that “the secret of the bomb” should be given to this new organization by Washington.<sup><a id="filepos1364073"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1935955">6</a></sup> The only truly effective way to control atomic arms, he believed, was by ceding the monopoly on military power to a world government.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦在文章中称，世界三大强国——美国、英国和苏联——应当联合建立一个新的世界政府，然后邀请其他国家加入。他用了一个有些让人误解的尚存争议的说法，说“原子弹的秘密”应当由华盛顿移交给这个新的组织。 他认为控制核武器唯一有效的办法就是让一个世界政府来垄断军事力量。



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>By then, in late 1945, the cold war was under way. America and Britain had begun to clash with Russia for imposing communist regimes in Poland and other eastern European areas occupied by the Red Army. For its part, Russia zealously sought a security perimeter and was neuralgic about any perceived attempt to interfere in its domestic affairs, which made its leaders resist surrendering any sovereignty to a world authority.</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
1945年年底，冷战已经爆发。由于苏联在红军占领的波兰和其他东欧地区强行建立共产主义政权，美英两国已经开始与苏联发生冲突。苏联正苦于寻找一个安全区域，任何干涉其内政的行为都会令其神经紧张，这使苏联领导人拒绝将任何主权交予一个世界政府。



</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>So Einstein sought to make it clear that the world government he <a id="filepos1364852"></a>envisioned would not try to impose a Western-style liberal democracy everywhere. He advocated a world legislature that would be elected directly by the people of each member country, in secret ballot, rather than appointed by the nation’s rulers. However, “it should not be necessary to change the internal structure of the three great powers,” he added as a reassurance to Russia. “Membership in a supranational security system should not be based on any arbitrary democratic standards.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

因此，爱因斯坦试图说明，他所设想的世界政府不会把一种西方式的自由民主强加到别处。他倡导建立一个世界立法机构，它将由每一个成员国的人民以无记名投票的方式直接选举产生，而不是由国家的统治者任命。不过，为了打消苏联的疑虑，他又补充说：“没有必要去改变三大强国的内在结构。一个超国家安全体系的成员资格不应建立在任何独断的民主标准之上。”

</p>
</div></div>




<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>One issue that Einstein could not resolve neatly was what right this world government would have to intervene in the internal affairs of nations. It must be able “to interfere in countries where a minority is oppressing a majority,” he said, citing Spain as an example. Yet that caused him contortions about whether this standard applied to Russia. “One must bear in mind that the people in Russia have not had a long tradition of political education,” he rationalized. “Changes to improve conditions in Russia had to be effected by a minority because there was no majority capable of doing so.”</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦很难解决的一个问题是，这个世界政府在什么时候才有权干涉国家的内部事务。他以西班牙为例说道，“如果一个国家的少数人正在压迫大多数人”，那么世界政府就可以“对这个国家进行干涉”。为了避免苏联误会，他解释说：“我们务必谨记，苏联人民并不具有接受政治教育的悠久传统，苏联状况的改善不得不由少数人来实现，因为大多数人并无此种能力。”



</p>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>Einstein’s efforts to prevent future wars were motivated not only by his old pacifist instincts but also, he admitted, by his guilty feelings about the role he had played in encouraging the atom bomb project. At a Manhattan dinner given by the Nobel Prize committee in December, he noted that Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, had created the award “to atone for having invented the most powerful explosives ever known up to his time.” He was in a similar situation. “Today, the physicists who participated in forging the most formidable and dangerous weapon of all times are harassed by an equal feeling of responsibility, not to say guilt,” he said.<sup><a id="filepos1366814"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1936487">7</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦为防止未来战争所做的努力不仅源于他从前的和平主义本能，而且也为他鼓励实施原子弹计划的愧疚感所促动。在诺贝尔奖委员会12月在曼哈顿举行的一次宴会上，爱因斯坦指出，诺贝尔设立这个奖的目的是“为了弥补曾经发明了当时威力最大的炸药”。他现在的处境也类似。他说：“今天，参与研制有史以来最可怕、最危险的武器的物理学家们正在为同样的责任感所困扰，虽然说不上是犯罪。”

<div class="left">
<p>These sentiments prompted Einstein, in May 1946, to take on the most prominent public policy role in his career. He became chairman of the newly formed Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, which was dedicated to nuclear arms control and world government. “The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking,” Einstein wrote in a fund-raising telegram that month, “and thus we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe.”<sup><a id="filepos1367393"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1936702">8</a></sup></p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
这些看法促使爱因斯坦1946年5月担任了他一生中最为显赫的公共政策角色。他成了新成立的致力于核军控和世界政府的原子能科学家应急委员会（ECAS）主席。在当月的一份筹款电报中，爱因斯坦说：“从原子中释放出来的巨大能量改变了除我们思维方式之外的一切，灾难正在向我们一步步逼近。”

<p>Leó Szilárd served as the executive director and did most of the organizational work. But Einstein, who served until the end of 1948, <a id="filepos1367635"></a>gave speeches, chaired meetings, and took his role seriously. “Our generation has brought into the world the most revolutionary force since prehistoric man’s discovery of fire,” he said. “This basic power of the universe cannot be fitted into the outmoded concept of narrow nationalisms.”<sup><a id="filepos1367965"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1937070">9</a></sup></p>

<p>On one side were those who celebrated the success of America and Britain in winning the race to develop such weapons. They saw the bomb as a guarantor of the freedoms of the West, and they wanted to guard what they saw as “the secret.” On the other side were arms control advocates like Einstein. “The secret of the atomic bomb is to America what the Maginot Line was to France before 1939,” he told <em>Newsweek.</em> “It gives us imaginary security, and in this respect it is a great danger.”<sup><a id="filepos1368910"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1937251">10</a></sup></p>

<p>It began when a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer scriptwriter named Sam Marx asked if he could come to Princeton to get Einstein’s cooperation on a docudrama about the making of the bomb. Einstein sent back word that he had no desire to help. A few weeks later Einstein got an anxious letter from an official with the Association of Manhattan Project Scientists saying that the movie seemed to be taking a very pro-military slant, celebrating the creation of the bomb and the security it gave to America. “I know that you will not want to lend your name to a picture which misrepresents the military and political implications of the bomb,” the letter said. “I hope that you will see fit to make the use of your name conditional on your personal approval of the script.”<sup><a id="filepos1370177"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1937406">11</a></sup></p>

米高梅电影制片公司的编剧萨姆·马克斯问是否可以来普林斯顿，与爱因斯坦合作完成一部有关原子弹研制的文献电视片。爱因斯坦回复说，他无意提供帮助。几周以后，爱因斯坦收到了曼哈顿计划科学家协会的一位官员写来的一封急切的信。信中说，电影似乎天然就有利于军事，能够宣传原子弹的研制成功以及它赋予美国的安全。“我知道您并不想让您的名字出现在一部误解原子弹的军事和政治含义的影片中，”信中说，“但我希望您能够视剧本情况决定是否使用您的名字。”

<p>The following week Szilárd came to see Einstein about the issue, and soon a bevy of peace-loving physicists was bombarding him with concerns.

一周后，西拉德就此问题拜访了爱因斯坦。不久，一些热爱和平的物理学家开始炮轰爱因斯坦和米高梅电影制片公司。爱因斯坦读了剧本，决定和他们一起抵制这部电影。“它所讲的事实完全是误导人的，我拒绝以我的名义进行合作，绝不允许用我的名字。”他说。

<p>He also sent a spiky letter to the famed mogul that attacked the proposed movie and also, for good measure, the tone of previous ones that Mayer had made. “Although I am not much of a moviegoer, I do know from the tenor of earlier films that have come out of your studio that you will understand my reasons,” he wrote. “I find that the whole film is written too much from the point of view of the Army and the Army leader of the project, whose influence was not always in the direction which one would desire from the point of view of humanity.”<sup><a id="filepos1371283"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1937582">12</a></sup></p>

他还给那位著名的巨头（梅耶）写了一封措辞严厉的信抨击这部电影，使用的也是梅耶曾经用过的那种腔调。“虽然我不常看电影，但是从您的公司早期拍摄的那些电影的一般趋向中，我知道您会理解我的理由，”他写道，“我发现整部电影基本上都是从军方和（曼哈顿）计划的军方领导人的观点写的，而他们的影响并不总是符合人性的观点所期望的方向。”

<p>Mayer turned Einstein’s letter over to the film’s chief editor, who responded with a memo that Mayer sent back to Einstein. President Truman, it said, “was most anxious to have the picture made” and had personally read and approved the script, an argument not likely to reassure Einstein. “As American citizens we are bound to respect the viewpoint of our government.” That, too, was not the best argument to use on Einstein. There followed an even less persuasive argument: “It must be realized that dramatic truth is just as compelling a requirement to us as veritable truth is to a scientist.”</p>

梅耶把爱因斯坦的信转交给了电影的总编，这位总编回了一张便笺，让梅耶寄给爱因斯坦。便笺说，杜鲁门总统“非常希望这部影片能够拍摄出来”，他亲自审阅了剧本并表示赞同。这种说法丝毫不能打消爱因斯坦的疑虑。“作为美国公民，我们一定要尊重政府的观点。”这种论证对爱因斯坦并不十分适用。接下来还有一个说服力更弱的论证：“必须认识到，戏剧性的真理对我们的要求就像真正的真理对科学家的要求一样是强制性的。”

<p>The memo concluded by promising that the moral issues raised by the scientists would be given a proper airing through the character of a fictional young scientist played by an actor named Tom Drake. “We selected among our young male players the one who best typifies earnestness and a spiritual quality,” it said reassuringly. “You need only recall his performance in ‘The Green Years.’ ”<sup><a id="filepos1372512"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1937814">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, this did not turn Einstein around. When Sam Marx, the scriptwriter, wrote beseeching him to change his mind and allow himself to be portrayed, Einstein replied curtly: “I have explained my point of view in a letter to Mr. Louis Mayer.” Marx was persistent. “When the picture is complete,” he wrote back, “the audience will feel in greatest sympathy with the young scientist.” And from later the same day: “Here is a new and revised script.”<sup><a id="filepos1373122"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1938052">14</a></sup></p>

毫无疑问，这并未使爱因斯坦回心转意。当编剧马克斯写信恳求他改变主意，允许别人饰演他时，爱因斯坦草草地答复道：“我已经在写给路易斯·迈尔先生的信中解释了我的观点。”但马克斯仍然顽固坚持，他在回信中写道：“影片完成后，观众将会对这位年轻科学家致以最深切的同情。”那一天晚些时候他又说：“这是新修订的剧本。”

Golden felt he was speaking “with almost childlike hope for salvation and without appearing to have thought through the details of his solution.” He reported back to Marshall, “It was surprising, though perhaps it should not have been, that, out of his métier of mathematics, he seemed naïve in the field of international politics.

在涉及苏联问题时，他长期以来的和平主义也出现了一种艰难的现实主义转折，就像纳粹在德国掌权之后那样。和平主义者可能会认为，爱因斯坦20世纪30年代与他们思想的决裂是因纳粹的特殊威胁而导致的心理失常，有些传记作者也认为这是一种暂时的反常。 但这种看法低估了爱因斯坦思想的转变。他再也不是一个纯粹的和平主义者了。

<p>When he was asked, for example, to join a campaign to persuade American scientists to refuse to work on atomic weapons, he not only declined but berated the organizers for advocating unilateral disarmament. “Disarmament cannot be effective unless all countries participate,” he lectured. “If even one nation continues to arm, openly or secretly, the disarmament of the others will involve disastrous consequences.”</p>

<p>The Red Scares and investigations into communist subversion originally had some legitimate justifications, but eventually they included bumbling inquisitions that resembled witch hunts. They began in earnest at the start of 1950, after America was stunned by news that the Soviets had developed their own bomb.

他在这篇文章中指出，不加限制的资本主义造成了巨大的贫富差距，经济繁荣总是伴随着经济衰退，失业率居高不下。这种制度所鼓励的是自私自利而非合作，是攫取财富而非为他人服务。人们接受教育是为了他们的职业，而不是出于对工作和创造的热爱。政党也因为巨额的政治捐助而变得腐败。

<p>These problems could be avoided, Einstein argued in his article, through a socialist economy, if it guarded against tyranny and centralization of power. “A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child,” he wrote. “The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.”</p>

爱因斯坦在文章中指出，如果能够防止专政和权力集中，那么这些问题可以通过一种社会主义经济来避免。“计划经济按照社会的需要而调节生产，它将把工作分配给一切能工作的人，并且保障每一个人，无论男女老幼，都能生活，”他写道，“对个人的教育，除了要发挥他本人天赋的才能，还应当努力发展他对整个人类的责任感，以代替我们目前这个社会中对权力和成功的崇拜。”

<p>He added, however, that planned economies faced the danger of becoming oppressive, bureaucratic, and tyrannical, as had happened in communist countries such as Russia. “A planned economy may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual,” he warned. It was therefore important for social democrats who believed in individual liberty to face two critical questions: “How is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to <a id="filepos1406441"></a>prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected?”<sup><a id="filepos1406574"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1947991">44</a></sup></p>

不过他又补充说，计划经济有可能发展成官僚主义和专制压迫，正如苏联等共产主义国家的情况那样。“计划经济本身可能伴随着对个人的完全奴役。”他警告说。因此，那些信仰个体自由的社会民主主义者需要面对两个关键问题：“鉴于政治权力和经济权力的高度集中，怎样才有可能防止官员变得权力无限和傲慢自负？怎样才能使个人权利得到保护？”

<p>That is why he remained outspoken about racial discrimination in America. In Princeton during the 1940s, movie theaters were still segregated, blacks were not allowed to try on shoes or clothes at department stores, and the student newspaper declared that equal access for blacks to the university was “a noble sentiment but the time had not yet come.”<sup><a id="filepos1407384"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1948219">45</a></sup></p>

正因为此，爱因斯坦才对美国的种族歧视直言不讳。在20世纪40年代的普林斯顿，电影院依然实行隔离制度，黑人不允许在百货商店试穿衣服和鞋子，学生报纸声称黑人与白人享有同等的上大学的机会只是“一种高尚的情感，但时机尚未到来”。

<p>As a Jew who had grown up in Germany, Einstein was acutely sensitive to such discrimination. “The more I feel an American, the more this situation pains me,” he wrote in an essay called “The Negro Question” for <em>Pageant</em> magazine. “I can escape the feeling of complicity in it only by speaking out.”<sup><a id="filepos1407830"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1948398">46</a></sup></p>

<p>Although he rarely accepted in person the many honorary degrees offered to him, Einstein made an exception when he was invited to Lincoln University, a black institution in Pennsylvania. Wearing his tattered gray herringbone jacket, he stood at a blackboard and went over his relativity equations for students, and then he gave a graduation address in which he denounced segregation as “an American tradition which is uncritically handed down from one generation to the next.”<sup><a id="filepos1408422"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1948615">47</a></sup> As if to break the pattern, he met with the 6-year-old son of Horace Bond, the university’s president.

尽管爱因斯坦很少接受授予他的许多荣誉学位，但是当宾夕法尼亚州的黑人教育机构林肯大学邀请他访问时，他破了例。他穿着破破烂烂的灰色夹克站在黑板前，为学生们温习了一遍他的相对论方程，然后做了一个毕业致辞。他谴责美国的种族隔离制度是“美国的一个未加批判的代代相传的传统”。 就好像是为了打破这种传统，他接见了林肯大学校长贺拉斯·邦德6岁的儿子朱利安·邦德。朱利安后来成了佐治亚州的参议员，是民权运动的领导人之一，也是全国有色人种协进会的主席。

<p>There was, however, one group for which Einstein could feel little tolerance after the war. “The Germans, as a whole nation, are responsible for these mass killings and should be punished as a people,” he declared.<sup><a id="filepos1408998"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1948874">48</a></sup> When a German friend, James Franck, asked him at the end of 1945 to join an appeal calling for a lenient treatment of the German economy, Einstein angrily refused. “It is absolutely necessary to prevent the restoration of German industrial policy for many years,” he said. “Should your appeal be circulated, I shall do whatever I can to oppose <a id="filepos1409403"></a>it.” When Franck persisted, Einstein became even more adamant. “The Germans butchered millions of civilians according to a well-prepared plan,” he wrote. “They would do it again if only they were able to. Not a trace of guilt or remorse is to be found among them.”<sup><a id="filepos1409709"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1949083">49</a></sup></p>

然而，有一个团体是爱因斯坦在战后几乎不能容忍的。“所有德国人对于这些大规模杀戮是有责任的，作为一个民族应当受到惩罚。”他宣称。 1945年年底，他的德国朋友詹姆斯·夫兰克要他帮助呼吁对德国经济进行宽大处理，他愤然拒绝了。“长期阻止德国恢复工业政策是绝对必要的，”他说，“倘若你们的呼吁流传开来，我会不遗余力地反对它。”虽然夫兰克继续坚持，但爱因斯坦变得愈发坚定。“德国按照周密计划屠杀了数百万平民，”他写道，“只要有能力，他们还会这样干的。在他们身上看不到一丝歉疚或忏悔。”

<p>Einstein would not even permit his books to be sold in Germany again, nor would he allow his name to be placed back on the rolls of any German scientific society. “The crimes of the Germans are really the most abominable ever to be recorded in the history of the so-called civilized nations,” he wrote the physicist Otto Hahn. “The conduct of the German intellectuals—viewed as a class—was no better than that of the mob.”<sup><a id="filepos1410271"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1949306">50</a></sup></p>
