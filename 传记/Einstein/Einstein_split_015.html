<p class="calibre29">As a self-assured 17-year-old, Einstein had enrolled at the Zurich Polytechnic and met Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>, the woman he would marry. Now, in October 1909, at age 30, he was returning to that city to take up his post as a junior professor at the nearby University of Zurich.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Their homecoming restored, at least temporarily, some of the romance to their relationship. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> was thrilled to be back in their original nesting ground, and by the end of their first month there she became pregnant again.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The apartment they rented was in a building where, they happily discovered, Friedrich Adler and his wife lived, and the couples became even closer friends. “They run a bohemian household,” Adler wrote his father approvingly. “The more I talk to Einstein, the more I realize that my favorable opinion of him was justified.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">The two men discussed physics and philosophy most evenings, often retreating to the attic of the three-story building so they would not be disturbed by children or spouses. Adler introduced Einstein to the work of Pierre Duhem, whose 1906 book <em class="calibre6">La Théorie Physique</em> Adler had just published in German. Duhem offered a more holistic approach than Mach did to the relationship between theories and experimental evidence, one that seemed to influence Einstein as he staked out his own philosophy of science.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos469217" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697633" class="calibre22">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos469315" class="calibre3"></a>Adler particularly respected Einstein’s “most independent” mind. There was, he told his father, a nonconformist streak in Einstein that reflected an inner security but not an arrogance. “We find ourselves in agreement on questions that the majority of physicists would not even understand,” Adler boasted.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos469662" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697863" class="calibre22">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein tried to persuade Adler to focus on science rather than be enticed into politics. “Be a little patient,” he said. “You will certainly be my successor in Zurich one day.” (Einstein was already assuming that he would move on to a more prestigious university.) But Adler ignored the advice and decided to become an editor at the Social Democratic Party newspaper. Loyalty to a party, Einstein felt, meant surrendering some independence of thought. Such conformity confounded him. “How an intelligent man can subscribe to a party I find a complete mystery,” Einstein later lamented about Adler.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos470400" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698052" class="calibre22">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was also reunited with his former classmate and note-taker Marcel Grossmann, who had helped him get his job at the patent office and was now a professor of math at their old Polytechnic. Einstein would often visit Grossmann after lunch for help with the complex geometry and calculus he needed to extend relativity into a more general field theory.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was even able to forge a friendship with the other distinguished math professor at the Polytechnic, Adolf Hurwitz, whose classes he had often skipped and who had spurned his plea for a job. Einstein became a regular at the Sunday music recitals at Hurwitz’s home. When Hurwitz told him during a walk one day that his daughter had been given a math homework problem she did not understand, Einstein showed up that afternoon to help her solve it.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos471376" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698189" class="calibre22">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">As Kleiner predicted, Einstein’s teaching talents improved. He was not a polished lecturer, but instead used informality to his advantage. “When he took his chair in shabby attire with trousers too short for him, we were skeptical,” recalled Hans Tanner, who attended most of Einstein’s Zurich lectures. Instead of prepared notes, Einstein used a card-sized strip of paper with scribbles. So the students got to watch him develop his thoughts as he spoke. “We obtained some insight into his working technique,” said Tanner. “We certainly appreciated this more than any stylistically perfect lecture.”</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos472179" class="calibre3"></a>At each step of the way, Einstein would pause and ask the students if they were following him, and he even permitted interruptions. “This comradely contact between teacher and student was, at that time, a rare occurrence,” according to Adolf Fisch, another who attended the lectures. Sometimes he would take a break and let the students gather around him for casual conversation. “With an impulsiveness and naturalness he would take students by the arm to discuss things,” recalled Tanner.</p>
<p class="calibre29">During one lecture, Einstein found himself momentarily stumped about the steps needed to complete a calculation. “There must be some silly mathematical transformation that I can’t find for a moment,” he said. “Can one of you gentlemen see it?” Not surprisingly, none of them could. So Einstein continued: “Then leave a quarter of a page. We won’t lose any time.”Ten minutes later, Einstein interrupted himself in the middle of another point and exclaimed, “I’ve got it.” As Tanner later marveled, “During the complicated development of his theme he had still found time to reflect upon the nature of that particular mathematical transformation.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">At the end of many of his evening lectures, Einstein would ask, “Who’s coming to the Café Terasse?” There, with an informal cadre on a terrace overlooking the Limmat River, they would talk until closing time.</p>
<p class="calibre29">On one occasion, Einstein asked if anyone wanted to come back to his apartment. “This morning I received some work from Planck in which there must be a mistake,” he said. “We could read it together.” Tanner and another student took him up on the offer and followed him home. There they all pored over Planck’s paper. “See if you can spot the fault while I make some coffee,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre29">After a while, Tanner replied, “You must be mistaken, Herr Professor, there is no error in it.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">“Yes, there is,” Einstein said, pointing to some discrepancies in the data, “for otherwise that and that would become that and that.” It was a vivid example of Einstein’s great strength: he could look at a complex mathematical equation, which for others was merely an abstraction, and picture the physical reality that lay behind it.</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos474890" class="calibre3"></a>Tanner was astounded. “Let’s write to Professor Planck,” he suggested, “and tell him of the mistake.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein had by then become slightly more tactful, especially with those he placed on a pedestal, such as Planck and Lorentz. “We won’t tell him he made a mistake,” he said. “The result is correct, but the proof is faulty. We’ll simply write and tell him how the real proof should run. The main thing is the content, not the mathematics.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos475464" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698327" class="calibre22">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Despite his work on his machine to measure electrical charges, Einstein had become a confirmed theorist rather than experimental physicist. When he was asked during his second year as a professor to supervise laboratory work, he was dismayed. He hardly dared, he told Tanner, “pick up a piece of apparatus for fear it might blow up.” To another eminent professor he confided, “My fears regarding the laboratory were rather well founded.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos476028" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698490" class="calibre22">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">As he was finishing his first academic year at Zurich, in July 1910, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> gave birth, again with difficulty, to their second son, named Eduard and called Tete. She was ill for weeks afterward. Her doctor, contending that she was overworked, suggested that Einstein find a way to make more money and pay for a maid. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> was annoyed and protective. “Isn’t it clear to anyone that my husband works himself half dead?” she said. Instead, her mother came down from Novi Sad to help.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos476707" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698674" class="calibre22">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Throughout his life, Einstein would sometimes appear aloof toward his two sons, especially Eduard, who suffered from increasingly severe mental illness as he grew older. But when they were young, he tended to be a good father. “When my mother was busy around the house, father would put aside his work and watch over us for hours, bouncing us on his knee,” Hans Albert later recalled. “I remember he would tell us stories—and he often played the violin in an effort to keep us quiet.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">One of his strengths as a thinker, if not as a parent, was that he had the ability, and the inclination, to tune out all distractions, a category that to him sometimes included his children and family. “Even the loudest baby-crying didn’t seem to disturb Father,” Hans Albert said. “He could go on with his work completely impervious to noise.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">One day his student Tanner came for a visit and found Einstein in <a id="filepos477873" class="calibre3"></a>his study poring over a pile of papers. He was writing with his right hand and holding Eduard with his left. Hans Albert was playing with toy bricks and trying to get his attention. “Wait a minute, I’ve nearly finished,” Einstein said, as he handed Eduard to Tanner and kept scribbling his equations. “It gave me,” said Tanner, “a glimpse into his immense powers of concentration.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos478308" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1698835" class="calibre22">8</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">Prague, 1911</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein had been in Zurich less than six months when he received, in March 1910, a solicitation to consider a more prestigious job: a full professorship at the German part of the University of Prague. Both the university and the academic position were a step up; however, moving from the familiar and friendly Zurich to the less congenial Prague would be disruptive for his family. For Einstein, the professional considerations outweighed the personal ones.</p>
<p class="calibre29">He was again going through difficult periods at home. “The bad mood that you noticed in me had nothing to do with you,” he wrote to his mother, who was now living in Berlin. “To dwell on the things that depress or anger us does not help in overcoming them. One must knock them down alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">His scientific work, on the other hand, was giving him great pleasure, and he expressed excitement about his possible new opportunity. “It is most probable that I will be offered the position of full professor at a large university with a significantly better salary than I now have.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos479711" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699088" class="calibre22">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">When word of Einstein’s possible move spread in Zurich, fifteen of his students, led by Hans Tanner, signed a petition urging officials there “to do your utmost to keep this outstanding researcher and teacher at our university.” They stressed the importance of having a professor in “this newly created discipline” of theoretical physics, and they extolled him personally in effusive terms. “Professor Einstein has an amazing talent for presenting the most difficult problems of theoretical physics so clearly and so comprehensibly that it is a great delight for us to follow his lectures, and he is so good at establishing a perfect rapport with his audience.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos480517" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699252" class="calibre22">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The Zurich authorities were so eager to keep him that they raised <a id="filepos480682" class="calibre3"></a>his salary from its current 4,500 francs, which was the same as he made as a patent examiner, to 5,500 francs. Those attempting to lure him to Prague, on the other hand, were having a more difficult time.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The faculty department at Prague had settled on Einstein as its first choice and forwarded the recommendation to the education ministry in Vienna. (Prague was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and such an appointment had to be approved by Emperor Franz Joseph and his ministers.) The report was accompanied by the highest possible recommendation from the best possible authority, Max Planck. Einstein’s theory of relativity “probably exceeds in audacity everything that has been achieved so far in speculative science,” Planck proclaimed. “This principle has brought about a revolution in our physical picture of the world that can be compared only to that produced by Copernicus.” In a comment that might later have seemed prescient to Einstein, Planck added, “Non-Euclidean geometry is child’s play by comparison.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos481827" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699440" class="calibre22">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Planck’s imprimatur should have been enough. But it wasn’t. The ministry decided that it preferred the second-place candidate, Gustav Jaumann, who had two advantages: he was Austrian, and he was not Jewish. “I did not get the call to Prague,” Einstein lamented to a friend in August. “I was proposed by the faculty, but because of my Semitic origin the ministry did not approve.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Jaumann, however, soon discovered that he was the faculty’s second choice, and he erupted. “If Einstein has been proposed as the first choice because of the belief that he has greater achievements to his credit,” he declared, “then I will have nothing to do with a university that chases after modernity and does not appreciate merit.” So by October 1910, Einstein could confidently declare that his own appointment was “almost certain.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">There was one final hurdle, also dealing with religion. Being a Jew was a disadvantage; being a nonbeliever who claimed <em class="calibre6">no</em> religion was a disqualifier. The empire required that all of its servants, including professors, be a member of some religion. On his official forms, Einstein had written that he had none. “Einstein is as unpractical as a child in cases like this,” Friedrich Adler’s wife noted.</p>
<p class="calibre29">As it turned out, Einstein’s desire for the job was greater than his <a id="filepos483494" class="calibre3"></a>ornery impracticality. He agreed to write “Mosaic” as his faith, and he also accepted Austro-Hungarian citizenship, with the proviso that he was allowed to remain a Swiss citizen as well. Along with the German citizenship that he had forsaken but that would soon be foisted back on him, that meant he had held, off and on, three citizenships by the age of 32. In January 1911, he was officially appointed to the post, with a pay twice what he had been making before his recent raise. He agreed to move to Prague that March.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos484041" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699664" class="calibre22">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein had two scientific heroes he had never met—Ernst Mach and Hendrik Lorentz—and he was able to visit them both before his move to Prague. When he went to Vienna for his formal presentation to the ministers there, he called on Mach, who lived in a suburb of that city. The aging physicist and preacher of empiricism, who so deeply influenced the Olympia Academy and instilled in Einstein a skepticism about unobservable concepts such as absolute time, had a gnarly beard and gnarlier personality. “Please speak loudly to me,” he barked when Einstein entered his room. “In addition to my other unpleasant characteristics I am also almost stone deaf.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein wanted to convince Mach of the reality of atoms, which the old man had long rejected as being imaginary constructs of the human mind. “Let us suppose that by assuming the existence of atoms in a gas we were able to predict an observable property of this gas that could not be predicted on the basis of non-atomistic theory,” Einstein asked. “Would you then accept such a hypothesis?”</p>
<p class="calibre29">“If with the help of the atomic hypothesis one could actually establish a connection between several observable properties which without it would remain isolated, then I should say that this hypothesis was an ‘economical’ one,” Mach grudgingly replied.</p>
<p class="calibre29">It was not a full acceptance, but it was enough for Einstein. “For the moment Einstein was satisfied,” his friend Philipp Frank noted. Nevertheless, Einstein began edging away from Mach’s skepticism about any theories of reality not built on directly observable data. He developed, said Frank, “a certain aversion to the Machist philosophy.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos486070" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1699988" class="calibre22">13</a></sup> It was the beginning of an important conversion.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Just before moving to Prague, Einstein went to the Dutch town of Leiden to meet Lorentz. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> accompanied him, and they accepted <a id="filepos486387" class="calibre3"></a>an invitation to stay with Lorentz and his wife. Einstein wrote that he was looking forward to having a conversation on “the radiation problem,” adding, “I wish to assure you in advance that I am not the orthodox light-quantizer for whom you take me.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos486674" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1700334" class="calibre22">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein had long idolized Lorentz from afar. Just before he went to visit, he wrote a friend: “I admire this man like no other; I might say, I love him.” The feeling was reinforced when they finally met. They stayed up late on Saturday night discussing such issues as the relationship between temperature and electrical conductivity.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Lorentz thought he had caught Einstein in a small mathematical mistake in one of his papers on light quanta, but in fact, as Einstein noted, it was simply “a one-time writing error” where he had left out a “½” that was included later in the paper.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos487457" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1700498" class="calibre22">15</a></sup> Both the hospitality and “scientific stimulus” made Einstein effusive in his next letter. “You radiate so much goodness and benevolence,” he wrote, “that the troubling conviction that I did not deserve the great kindness and honors could not even enter my mind during my stay at your house.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos487832" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1700656" class="calibre22">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Lorentz became, in the words of Abraham Pais, “the one father figure in Einstein’s life.” After his pleasant visit to Lorentz’s study in Leiden, he would return whenever he could find an excuse. The atmosphere of such meetings was captured by their colleague Paul Ehrenfest:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre38"><p class="calibre21">The best easy chair was carefully pushed in place next to the large work table for his esteemed guest. A cigar was given to him, and then Lorentz quietly began to formulate questions concerning Einstein’s theory of the bending of light in a gravitational field . . . As Lorentz spoke on, Einstein began to puff less frequently on his cigar, and he sat more intently in his armchair. And when Lorentz had finished, Einstein bent over the slip of paper on which Lorentz had written mathematical formulas. The cigar was out, and Einstein pensively twisted his finger in a lock of hair over his right ear. Lorentz sat smiling at an Einstein completely lost in meditation, exactly the way that a father looks at a particularly beloved son—full of confidence that the youngster will crack the nut he has given him, but eager to see how. Suddenly, Einstein’s head sat up joyfully; he had it. Still a bit of give and take, interrupting one another, a partial disagreement, very quick clarification and a complete mutual understanding, and then both men with beaming eyes skimming over the shining riches of the new theory.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos489447" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1700820" class="calibre22">17</a></sup></p></blockquote><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos489559" class="calibre3"></a>When Lorentz died in 1928, Einstein would say in his eulogy, “I stand at the grave of the greatest and noblest man of our times.” And in 1953, for the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of Lorentz’s birth, Einstein wrote an essay on his importance. “Whatever came from this supreme mind was as lucid and beautiful as a good work of art,” he wrote. “He meant more to me personally than anybody else I have met in my lifetime.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos490044" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1701057" class="calibre22">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> was unhappy about moving to Prague. “I am not going there gladly and I expect very little pleasure,” she wrote a friend. But initially, until the city’s dirtiness and snobbishness became oppressive, their life there was nice enough. They had electric lighting in their home for the first time, and both the space and money for a live-in maid. “The people are haughty, shabby-genteel, or subservient, depending on their lot in life,” Einstein said. “Many of them possess a certain grace.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos490722" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1701396" class="calibre22">19</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">From Einstein’s office at the university he could look down on a beautiful park with shady trees and manicured gardens. In the morning, it would be filled just with women, and in the afternoon just with men. Some walked alone as if deep in thought, Einstein noticed, while others clustered in groups holding animated arguments. Eventually, Einstein asked what the park was. It belonged, he was told, to an insane asylum. When he showed his friend Philipp Frank the view, Einstein commented ruefully, “Those are the madmen who do not occupy themselves with the quantum theory.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos491420" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1701734" class="calibre22">20</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The Einsteins became acquainted with Bertha Fanta, a delightfully cultured woman who hosted at her home a literary and musical salon for Prague’s Jewish intelligentsia. Einstein was the ideal catch: a rising scholar who was willing, with equal gusto, to play the violin or discuss Hume and Kant, depending on the spirit of the occasion. Other habitués included the young writer Franz Kafka and his friend Max Brod.</p>
<p class="calibre29">In his book <em class="calibre6">The Redemption of Tycho Brahe,</em> Brod seemed to use (though he sometimes denied it) Einstein as the model for the character of Johannes Kepler, the brilliant astronomer who had been Brahe’s assistant in Prague in 1600. The character is devoted to his scientific work and is always willing to throw away conventional thinking. But in the realm of the personal, he is protected from “the aberrations of feeling” <a id="filepos492448" class="calibre3"></a>by his aloof and abstracted air. “He had no heart and therefore nothing to fear from the world,” Brod wrote. “He was not capable of emotion or love.” When the novel came out, a fellow scientist, Walther Nernst, said to Einstein, “You are this man Kepler.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos492751" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1701870" class="calibre22">21</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Not really. Despite the image he sometimes cast as a loner, Einstein continued to establish, as he had back in Zurich and Bern, intimate friendships and emotional bonds, particularly with fellow thinkers and scientists. One such friend was Paul Ehrenfest, a young Jewish physicist from Vienna who was teaching at the University of St. Petersburg but feeling professionally stymied there because of his background. In early 1912, he embarked on a trip through Europe looking for a new job, and on his way toward Prague contacted Einstein, with whom he had been corresponding about gravity and radiation. “Do stay at my house so that we can make good use of the time,” Einstein responded.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos493553" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1702122" class="calibre22">22</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">When Ehrenfest arrived one rainy Friday afternoon in February, a cigar-puffing Einstein and his wife were at the train station to meet him. They all walked to a café, where they compared the great cities of Europe. When Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> left, the discussion turned to science, most notably statistical mechanics, and they continued talking as they walked to Einstein’s office. “On the way to the institute, first argument about everything,” Ehrenfest recorded in his diary of the seven days he spent in Prague.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Ehrenfest was a mousy and insecure man, but his eagerness for friendship and his love of physics made it easy for him to forge a bond with Einstein.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos494423" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1702294" class="calibre22">23</a></sup> They both seemed to crave arguing about science, and Einstein later said that “within a few hours we were friends as if Nature created us for each other.”Their intense discussions continued the next day, as Einstein explained his efforts to generalize his theory of relativity. On Sunday evening, they relaxed a bit by performing Brahms, with Ehrenfest on piano, Einstein on violin, and 7-year-old Hans Albert singing. “Yes we will be friends,” Ehrenfest wrote in his diary that night. “Was awfully happy.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos495013" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1702542" class="calibre22">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was already thinking of leaving Prague, and he suggested Ehrenfest as a possible successor. But he “adamantly refuses to profess any religious affiliation,” Einstein lamented. Unlike Einstein, who was willing to relent and write “Mosaic” on his official forms, Ehrenfest <a id="filepos495416" class="calibre3"></a>had abandoned Judaism and would not profess otherwise. “Your stubborn refusal to acknowledge any religious affiliation really <em class="calibre6">bugs</em> me,” Einstein wrote him in April. “Drop it for your children’s sake. After all, after becoming a professor here you could revert to this strange hobby horse of yours.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos495765" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1702783" class="calibre22">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Matters eventually came to a happy resolution when Ehrenfest accepted an offer, which Einstein had earlier received but declined, to replace the revered Lorentz, who was cutting back from full-time teaching at the University of Leiden. Einstein was thrilled, for it meant he would now have two friends there to visit regularly. It became, for Einstein, almost a second academic home and a way to escape the oppressive atmosphere he later found in Berlin. Almost every year for the next two decades, until 1933 when Ehrenfest committed suicide and Einstein moved to America, Einstein would make regular pilgrimages to see him and Lorentz in Leiden or at the seaside resorts nearby.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos496549" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703304" class="calibre22">26</a></sup></p>

<p class="calibre29">Ernest Solvay was a Belgian chemist and industrialist who reaped a fortune by inventing a method for making soda. Because he wanted to do something unusual yet useful with his money, and also because he had some odd theories of gravity that he wanted scientists to listen to, he decided to fund an elite gathering of Europe’s top physicists. Scheduled for the end of October 1911, it eventually spawned a series of influential meetings, known as Solvay Conferences, that were held sporadically over the ensuing years.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Twenty of Europe’s most famous scientists showed up at the Grand Hotel Metropole in Brussels. At 32, Einstein was the youngest. There was Max Planck, Henri Poincaré, Marie Curie, Ernest Rutherford, and Wilhelm Wien. The chemist Walther Nernst organized the event and acted as chaperone for the quirky Ernest Solvay. The kindly Hendrik Lorentz served as the chairman, as his fan Einstein put it, “with incomparable tact and unbelievable virtuosity.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos497837" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703520" class="calibre22">27</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The focus of the conference was “the quantum problem,” and Einstein was asked to present a paper on that topic, making him one of only eight “particularly competent members” thus honored. He expressed <a id="filepos498161" class="calibre3"></a>some annoyance, perhaps a bit more feigned than real, about the prestigious assignment. He dubbed the upcoming meeting “the witch’s Sabbath” and complained to Besso, “My twaddle for the Brussels conference weighs down on me.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos498428" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703684" class="calibre22">28</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s talk was titled “The Present State of the Problem of Specific Heats.” Specific heat—the quantity of energy required to increase the temperature of a specific amount of substance by a certain amount—had been a specialty of Einstein’s former professor and antagonist at the Zurich Polytechnic, Heinrich Weber. Weber had discovered some anomalies, especially at low temperatures, in the laws that were supposed to govern specific heat. Beginning in late 1906, Einstein had come up with what he called a “quantized” approach to the problem by surmising that the atoms in each substance could absorb energy only in discrete packets.</p>
<p class="calibre29">In his 1911 Solvay lecture, Einstein put these issues into the larger context of the so-called quantum problem. Was it possible, he asked, to avoid accepting the physical reality of these atomistic particles of light, which were like bullets aimed at the heart of Maxwell’s equations and, indeed, all of classical physics?</p>
<p class="calibre29">Planck, who had pioneered the concept of the quanta, continued to insist that they came into play only when light was being emitted or absorbed. They were not a real-world feature of light itself, he argued. Einstein, in his talk to the conference, sorrowfully demurred: “These discontinuities, which we find so distasteful in Planck’s theory, seem really to exist in nature.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos500054" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1703917" class="calibre22">29</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><em class="calibre6">Really to exist in nature.</em> It was, for Einstein, an odd phrase. To a pure proponent of Mach, or for that matter of Hume, the whole phrase “really to exist in nature” lacked clear meaning. In his special relativity theory, Einstein had avoided assuming the existence of such things as absolute time and absolute distance, because it seemed meaningless to say that they “really” existed in nature when they couldn’t be observed. But henceforth, during the more than four decades in which he would express his discomfort with quantum theory, he increasingly sounded like a scientific realist, someone who believed that an underlying reality existed in nature that was independent of our ability to observe or measure it.</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos500966" class="calibre3"></a>When he was finished, Einstein faced a barrage of challenges from Lorentz, Planck, Poincaré, and others. Some of what Einstein said, Lorentz rose to point out,“seems in fact to be totally incompatible with Maxwell’s equations.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein agreed, perhaps too readily, that “the quantum hypothesis is provisional” and that it “does not seem compatible with the experimentally verified conclusions of the wave theory.” Somehow it was necessary, he told his questioners, to accommodate both wave and particle approaches to the understanding of light. “In addition to Maxwell’s electrodynamics, which is essential to us, we must also admit a hypothesis such as that of quanta.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos501770" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704251" class="calibre22">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">It was unclear, even to Einstein, whether Planck was persuaded of the reality of quanta. “I largely succeeded in convincing Planck that my conception is correct, after he has struggled against it for so many years,” Einstein wrote his friend Heinrich Zangger. But a week later, Einstein gave Zangger another report: “Planck stuck stubbornly to some undoubtedly wrong preconceptions.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">As for Lorentz, Einstein remained as admiring as ever: “A living work of art! He was in my opinion the most intelligent of the theoreticians present.” He dismissed Poincaré, who paid little attention to him, with a brusque stroke: “Poincaré was simply negative in general, and, all his acumen notwithstanding, he showed little grasp of the situation.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos502723" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704436" class="calibre22">31</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Overall he gave low marks to the conference, where most of the time was spent bewailing rather than resolving quantum theory’s threat to classical mechanics. “The congress in Brussels resembled the lamentations on the ruins of Jerusalem,” he wrote Besso. “Nothing positive has come out of it.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos503150" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704607" class="calibre22">32</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">There was one interesting sideshow for Einstein: the romance between the widowed Marie Curie and the married Paul Langevin. Dignified and dedicated, Madame Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize; she shared the 1903 physics prize with her husband and one other scientist for their work on radiation. Three years later, her husband was killed by a horse-drawn wagon. She was bereft, and so was her late husband’s protégé, Langevin, who taught physics at the Sorbonne with the Curies. Langevin was trapped in a marriage with a <a id="filepos503798" class="calibre3"></a>wife who physically abused him, and soon he and Marie Curie were having an affair in a Paris apartment. His wife had someone break into it and steal their love letters.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Just as the Solvay Conference was getting under way, with both Curie and Langevin in attendance, the purloined letters began appearing in a Paris tabloid as a prelude to a sensational divorce case. In addition, at that very moment, it was announced that Curie had won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, for discovering radium and polonium.<a id="filepos504364" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_052.html#filepos2411178" class="calibre22">*</a> A member of the Swedish Academy wrote her to suggest that she not appear to receive it, given the furor raised by her relationship with Langevin, but she coolly responded, “I believe there is no connection between my scientific work and the facts of private life.” She headed to Stockholm and accepted the prize.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos504729" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704769" class="calibre22">33</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The whole furor seemed silly to Einstein. “She is an unpretentious, honest person,” he said, with “a sparkling intelligence.” He also rather bluntly came to the conclusion, not justified, that she was not pretty enough to wreck anyone’s marriage. “Despite her passionate nature,” he said, “she is not attractive enough to represent a danger to anyone.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos505239" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1704911" class="calibre22">34</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">More gracious was the sturdy letter of support he sent her later that month:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre38"><p class="calibre21">Do not laugh at me for writing you without having anything sensible to say. But I am so enraged by the base manner in which the public is presently daring to concern itself with you that I absolutely must give vent to this feeling. I am impelled to tell you how much I have come to admire your intellect, your drive, and your honesty, and that I consider myself lucky to have made your personal acquaintance in Brussels. Anyone who does not number among these reptiles is certainly happy, now as before, that we have such personages among us as you, and Langevin too, real people with whom one feels privileged to be in contact. If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply don’t read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos506290" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1705075" class="calibre22">35</a></sup></p></blockquote><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><a id="filepos506426" class="calibre11"></a><em class="calibre35">Enter Elsa</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">As Einstein wandered around Europe giving speeches and basking in his rising renown, his wife stayed behind in Prague, a city she hated, and brooded about not being part of the scientific circles that she once struggled to join. “I would like to have been there and listened a little, and seen all these fine people,” she wrote him after one of his talks in October 1911. “It is so long since we saw each other that I wonder if you will recognize me.” She signed herself, “Deine alte D,” your old D, as if she were still his Dollie, albeit a bit older.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos507119" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1705409" class="calibre22">36</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Her circumstances, perhaps combined with an innate disposition, caused her to become gloomy, even depressed. When Philipp Frank met her in Prague for the first time, he thought that she might be schizophrenic. Einstein concurred, and he later told a colleague that her gloominess “is doubtless traceable to a schizophrenic genetic disposition coming from her mother’s family.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos507617" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1705608" class="calibre22">37</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Thus it was that Einstein’s marriage was once again in an unstable state when he traveled alone to Berlin during the Easter holidays in 1912. There he became reacquainted with a cousin, three years older, whom he had known as a child.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Elsa Einstein<a id="filepos508026" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_053.html#filepos2411586" class="calibre22">*</a> was the daughter of Rudolf (“the rich”) Einstein and Fanny Koch Einstein. She was Einstein’s cousin on both sides. Her father was the first cousin of Einstein’s father, Hermann, and had helped fund his business. Her mother was the sister of Einstein’s mother, Pauline (making Elsa and Albert first cousins). After Hermann’s death, Pauline had moved in with Rudolf and Fanny Einstein for a few years, helping them keep house.</p>
<p class="calibre29">As children, Albert and Elsa had played together at the home of Albert’s parents in Munich and on one occasion had shared a first artistic experience at the opera.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos508753" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1705811" class="calibre22">38</a></sup> Since then, Elsa had been married, divorced, and now, at age 36, was living with her two daughters, Margot and Ilse, in the same apartment building as her parents.</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos509016" class="calibre3"></a>The contrast with Einstein’s wife was stark. Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> was exotic, intellectual, and complex. Elsa wasn’t. Instead, she was conventionally handsome and domestically nurturing. She loved heavy German comfort foods and chocolate, which tended to give her a rather ample, matronly look. Her face was similar to her cousin’s, and it would become strikingly more so as they aged.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos509462" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1705951" class="calibre22">39</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein was looking for new companionship, and he first flirted with Elsa’s sister. But by the end of his Easter visit, he had settled on Elsa as offering the comfort and nurturing that he now craved. The love he was seeking, it seems, was not wild romance but uncomplicated support and affection.</p>
<p class="calibre29">And Elsa, who revered her cousin, was eager to give it. When he returned to Prague, she wrote him right away—sending the letter to his office, not his home, and proposing a way they could correspond in secret. “How dear of you not to be too proud to communicate with me in such a way!” he responded. “I can’t even begin to tell you how fond I have become of you during these few days.” She asked him to destroy her letters, which he did. She, on the other hand, kept his responses for the rest of her life in a folder that she tied and later labeled “Especially beautiful letters from better days.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos510573" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1706098" class="calibre22">40</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein apologized for his flirtation with her sister Paula.“It is hard for me to understand how I could have taken a fancy to her,” he declared. “But it is in fact simple. She was young, a girl, and complaisant.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">A decade earlier, when he was writing his love letters to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> that celebrated their own rarefied and bohemian approach to life, Einstein would likely have lumped relatives such as Elsa into the category of “bourgeois philistines.” But now, in letters that were almost as effusive as the ones he had written to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>, he professed his new passion for Elsa. “I have to have someone to love, otherwise life is miserable,” he wrote. “And this someone is you.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">She knew how to make him defensive: she teased him for being under Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>’s thumb and asserted that he was “henpecked.” As she may have hoped, Einstein responded by protesting that he would show her otherwise. “Do not think about me in such a way!” he said. “I categorically assure you that I consider myself a full-fledged male. Perhaps I will sometime have the opportunity to prove it to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos512127" class="calibre3"></a>Spurred by this new affection and by the prospect of working in the world’s capital of theoretical physics, Einstein developed a desire to move to Berlin. “The chances of getting a call to Berlin are, unfortunately, slight,” he admitted to Elsa. But on his visit, he did what he could to increase his chances of someday getting a position there. In his notebook he listed appointments he had been able to get with important academic leaders, including the scientists Fritz Haber, Walther Nernst, and Emil Warburg.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos512670" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1706353" class="calibre22">41</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein’s son Hans Albert later recalled that it was just after his eighth birthday, in the spring of 1912, when he noticed that his parents’ marriage was falling apart. But after returning to Prague from Berlin, Einstein seemed to develop qualms about his affair with his cousin. He tried, in two letters, to put an end to it. “There would only be confusion and misfortune if we were to give into our mutual attraction,” he wrote Elsa.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Later that month, he tried to be even more definitive. “It will not be good for the two of us, as well as for the others, if we form a closer attachment. So, I am writing to you today for the last time and am submitting again to the inevitable, and you must do the same. You know that it is not hardness of heart or lack of feeling that makes me talk like this, because you know that, like you, I bear my cross without hope.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos513729" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1706635" class="calibre22">42</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> shared one thing: a feeling that living among the middle-class German community in Prague had become wearisome. “These are not people with natural sentiments,” he told Besso. They displayed “a peculiar mixture of snobbery and servility, without any kind of goodwill toward their fellow men.” The water was un-drinkable, the air was full of soot, and an ostentatious luxury was juxtaposed with misery on the streets. But what offended Einstein most were the artificial class structures. “When I come to the institute,” he complained, “a servile man who smells of alcohol bows and says, ‘your most humble servant.’ ”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos514565" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1706802" class="calibre22">43</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> worried that the bad water, milk, and air were hurting the health of their younger son, Eduard. He had lost his appetite and was not sleeping well. It was also now clear that her husband cared more about his science than his family. “He is tirelessly working on his problems; one can say that he lives only for them,” she told her friend Helene <a id="filepos515066" class="calibre3"></a>Savi<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>. “I must confess with a bit of shame that we are unimportant to him and take second place.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos515226" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707054" class="calibre22">44</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">So Einstein and his wife decided to return to the one place they thought could restore their relationship.</p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><em class="calibre35">Zurich, 1912</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">The Zurich Polytechnic, where Einstein and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> had blissfully shared their books and their souls, had been upgraded in June 1911 to a full university, now named the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH), or the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, with the right to grant graduate degrees. At 32 and by now quite famous in the world of theoretical physics, Einstein should have been an easy and obvious choice for one of the new professorships available there.</p>
<p class="calibre29">That possibility had been discussed a year earlier. Before he left for Prague, Einstein had made a deal with officials in Zurich. “I promised in private that I would advise them before accepting another offer from somewhere else, so that the administration of the Polytechnic could also make me an offer if they find it fit to do so,” he told a Dutch professor who was trying to recruit him to Utrecht.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos516596" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707349" class="calibre22">45</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">By November 1911, Einstein had received such an offer from Zurich, or at least so he thought, and as a result he declined the offer to go to Utrecht. But the matter was not completely settled, because some of Zurich’s education officials objected. They argued that a professor in theoretical physics was a “luxury,” that there was not enough lab space to accommodate one, and that Einstein personally was not a good teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Heinrich Zangger, a longtime friend who was a medical researcher in Zurich, intervened on Einstein’s behalf. “A proper theoretical physicist is a necessity these days,” he wrote in a letter to one of the top Swiss councilors. He also pointed out that in such a role Einstein “needs no laboratory.” As for Einstein’s teaching talents, Zangger provided a wonderfully nuanced and revealing description:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre38"><p class="calibre21">He is not a good teacher for mentally lazy gentlemen who merely want to fill a notebook and then learn it by heart for an exam; he is not a <a id="filepos517850" class="calibre3"></a>smooth talker, but anyone wishing to learn honestly how to develop his ideas in physics in an honest way, from deep within, and how to examine all premises carefully and see the pitfalls and the problems in his reflections, will find Einstein a first-class teacher, because all of this is expressed in his lectures, which force the audience to think along.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos518218" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707555" class="calibre22">46</a></sup></p></blockquote><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">Zangger wrote Einstein to express his outrage at the dithering in Zurich, and Einstein replied, “The dear Zurich folks can kiss my . . . [und die lieben Züricher können mich auch . . . (ellipses are in original letter)].” He told Zangger not to push the matter further. “Leave the Polytechnic<a id="filepos518650" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_054.html#filepos2411954" class="calibre22">*</a> to God’s inscrutable ways.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos518730" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707808" class="calibre22">47</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein, however, decided not to drop the matter but instead to push the Polytechnic through a light ruse. Officials at the university in Utrecht were just about to offer their open post to someone else, Peter Debye, when Einstein asked them to hold off. “I am turning to you with a strange request,” he wrote. The Zurich Polytechnic had initially seemed very eager to recruit him, he said, and it had been proceeding with haste out of fear that he would go to Utrecht. “But if they were to learn in the near future that Debye is going to Utrecht, they would lose their fervor at once and keep me forever in suspense. I ask you therefore to wait a little longer with the official offer to Debye.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos519555" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1707973" class="calibre22">48</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Rather oddly, Einstein found himself needing letters of recommendation to secure a post at his own alma mater. Marie Curie wrote one. “In Brussels, where I attended a scientific conference in which Mr. Einstein also participated, I was able to admire the clarity of his intellect, the breadth of his information, and the profundity of his knowledge,” she noted.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos520032" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708135" class="calibre22">49</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Adding to the irony was that his other main letter of recommendation came from Henri Poincaré, the man who had almost come up with the special theory of relativity but still had not embraced it. Einstein was “one of the most original minds I have ever come across,” he said. Particularly poignant was his description of Einstein’s willingness, which Poincaré himself lacked, to make radical conceptual leaps: “What I admire in him in particular is the facility with which he adapts himself to new concepts. He does not remain attached to classical principles, and, when presented with a problem in physics, is prompt to envision all the possibilities.” Poincaré, however, could not resist asserting, perhaps with relativity in mind, that Einstein might not be right in all his theories: “Since he seeks in all directions one must expect the majority of the paths on which he embarks to be blind alleys.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos521096" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708389" class="calibre22">50</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos521195" class="calibre3"></a>Soon it all worked out. Einstein would move back to Zurich in July 1912. He thanked Zangger for helping him to prevail “against all odds,” and exulted, “I am enormously happy that we will be together again.” Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> was thrilled as well. She thought that the return could help save both her sanity and their marriage. Even the children seemed happy to be out of Prague and back to the city of their birth. As Einstein put it in a postcard to another friend,“Great joy about it among us old folks and the two bear cubs.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos521799" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708661" class="calibre22">51</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">His departure caused a minor controversy in Prague. Newspaper articles noted that anti-Semitism at the university may have played a role. Einstein felt compelled to issue a public statement. “Despite all presumptions,” he said,“I did not feel and did not notice any religious prejudice.” The appointment of Philipp Frank, a Jew, as his successor, he added, confirmed that “such considerations”were not a major problem.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos522357" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1708831" class="calibre22">52</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Life in Zurich should have been glorious. The Einsteins were able to afford a modern six-room apartment with grand views. They were reunited with friends such as Zangger and Grossmann, and there was even one fewer adversary. “The fierce Weber has died, so it will be very pleasant from a personal point of view,” Einstein wrote of their undergraduate physics professor and nemesis, Heinrich Weber.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos522870" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1709197" class="calibre22">53</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Once again there were musical gatherings at the home of math professor Adolf Hurwitz. The programs included not only Mozart, Einstein’s favorite, but also Schumann, who was Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>’s. On Sunday afternoons, Einstein would arrive with his wife and two little boys at the doorstep and announce, “Here comes the whole Einstein hen house.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Despite being back with such friends and diversions, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>’s depression continued to deepen, and her health to decline. She developed <a id="filepos523600" class="calibre3"></a>rheumatism, which made it hard for her to go out, especially when the streets became icy in winter. She attended the Hurwitz recitals less frequently, and when she did show up her gloom was increasingly evident. In February 1913, to entice her out, the Hurwitz family planned an all-Schumann recital. She came, but seemed paralyzed by pain, both mental and physical.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos523978" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1709357" class="calibre22">54</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Thus the atmosphere was ripe for a catalyst that would disrupt this unstable family situation. It came in the form of a letter. After almost a year of silence, Elsa Einstein wrote to her cousin.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The previous May, when he had declared that he was writing her “for the last time,” Einstein had nonetheless given her the address of what would be his new office in Zurich. Now Elsa decided to send him a greeting for his thirty-fourth birthday, and she added a request for a picture of him and a recommendation of a good book she could read on relativity. She knew how to flatter.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos524726" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1709542" class="calibre22">55</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">“There is no book on relativity that is comprehensible to the layman,” he replied. “But what do you have a relativity cousin for? If you ever happen to be in Zurich, then we (without my wife, who is unfortunately very jealous) will take a nice walk, and I will tell you about all of those curious things that I discovered.” Then he went a bit further. Instead of sending a picture, wouldn’t it be better to see each other in person? “If you wish to make me truly happy, then arrange to spend a few days here sometime.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos525390" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1709859" class="calibre22">56</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">A few days later, he wrote again, with word that he had instructed a photographer to send her a picture. He had been working on generalizing his theory of relativity, he reported, and it was exhausting. As he had a year earlier, he complained about being married to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>: “What I wouldn’t give to be able to spend a few days with you, but without my cross!” He asked Elsa if she would be in Berlin later that summer. “I would like to come for a short visit.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos526022" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710025" class="calibre22">57</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">It was therefore not surprising that Einstein was very receptive, a few months later, when the two towers of Berlin’s scientific establishment—Max Planck and Walther Nernst—came to Zurich with an enticing proposal. Having been impressed by Einstein at the Solvay Conference of 1911, they had already been sounding out colleagues about getting him to Berlin.</p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos526553" class="calibre3"></a>The offer they brought with them, when they arrived with their wives on the night train from Berlin on July 11, 1913, had three impressive components: Einstein would be elected to a coveted vacancy in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, which would come with a hefty stipend; he would become the director of a new physics institute; and he would be made a professor at the University of Berlin. The package included a lot of money, and it was not nearly as much work as it may have seemed on the surface. Planck and Nernst made it clear that Einstein would have no required teaching duties at the university and no real administrative tasks at the institute. And though he would be required to accept German citizenship once again, he could keep his Swiss citizenship as well.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The visitors made their case during a long visit to Einstein’s sunny office at the Polytechnic. He said he needed a few hours to think it over, though it is likely he knew he would accept. So Planck and Nernst took their wives on an excursion by funicular railway up one of the nearby mountains. With puckish amusement, Einstein told them he would be awaiting their return to the station with a signal. If he had decided to decline, he would be carrying a white rose, and if he was going to accept, a red rose (some accounts have the signal being a white handkerchief). When they stepped off the train, they happily discovered that he had accepted.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos528050" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710187" class="calibre22">58</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">That meant that Einstein would become, at 34, the youngest member of the Prussian Academy. But first Planck had to get him elected. The letter he wrote, which was also signed by Nernst and others, had the memorable but incorrect concession, quoted earlier, that “he might sometimes have overshot the target in his speculations, as for example in his light quantum hypothesis.” But the rest of the letter was suffused with extravagant praise for each of his many scientific contributions. “Among the great problems abundant in modern physics, there is hardly one to which Einstein has not made a remarkable contribution.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos528798" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710619" class="calibre22">59</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The Berliners were taking a risk, Einstein realized. He was being recruited not for his teaching skills (as he would not be teaching), nor for his administrative ones. And even though he had been publishing outlines and papers describing his ongoing efforts to generalize relativity, <a id="filepos529181" class="calibre3"></a>it was unclear whether he would succeed in that quest. “The Germans are gambling on me as they would on a prize-winning hen,” he told a friend as they were leaving a party, “but I don’t know if I can still lay eggs.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos529439" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710854" class="calibre22">60</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein, likewise, was taking a risk. He had a secure and lucrative post in a city and society that he, his wife, and his family loved. The Swiss personality agreed with him. His wife had a Slav’s revulsion for all things Teutonic, and he had a similar distaste that had been in-grained in childhood. As a boy he had run away from Prussian-accented parades and Germanic rigidity. Only the opportunity to be gloriously coddled in the world capital of science could have compelled him to make such a move.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein found the prospect thrilling and a bit amusing. “I am going to Berlin as an Academy-man without any obligations, rather like a living mummy,” he wrote fellow physicist Jakob Laub. “I’m already looking forward to this difficult career!”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos530384" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1710993" class="calibre22">61</a></sup> To Ehrenfest he admitted, “I accepted this odd sinecure because giving lectures gets on my nerves.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos530543" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711152" class="calibre22">62</a></sup> However, to the venerable Hendrik Lorentz in Holland Einstein displayed more gravitas: “I could not resist the temptation to accept a position in which I am relieved of all responsibilities so that I can give myself over completely to rumination.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos530850" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711316" class="calibre22">63</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">There was, of course, another factor that made the new job enticing: the chance to be with his cousin and new love, Elsa. As he would later admit to his friend Zangger, “She was the main reason for my going to Berlin, you know.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos531194" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711480" class="calibre22">64</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The same evening that Planck and Nernst left Zurich, Einstein wrote Elsa an excited letter describing the “colossal honor” they had offered. “Next spring at the latest, I’ll come to Berlin for good,” he exulted. “I already rejoice at the wonderful times we will spend together!”</p>
<p class="calibre29">During the ensuing week, he sent two more such notes. “I rejoice at the thought that I will soon be coming to you,” he wrote in the first. And a few days later: “Now we will be together and rejoice in each other!” It is impossible to know for sure what relative weight to assign to each of the factors enticing him to Berlin: the unsurpassed scientific community there, the glories and perks of the post he was offered, or the chance to be with Elsa. But at least to her he claimed it was primarily <a id="filepos532193" class="calibre3"></a>the latter. “I look forward keenly to Berlin, mainly because I look forward to <em class="calibre6">you.</em>”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos532310" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711721" class="calibre22">65</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Elsa had actually tried to help him get the offer. Earlier in the year, on her own initiative, she had dropped in on Fritz Haber, who ran the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Chemistry in Berlin, and let him know that her cousin might be open to a position that would bring him to Berlin. When he learned of Elsa’s intervention, Einstein was amused. “Haber knows who he is dealing with. He knows how to appreciate the influence of a friendly female cousin . . . The nonchalance with which you dropped in on Haber is pure Elsa. Did you tell anyone about it, or did you consult only with your wicked heart? If only I could have looked on!”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos533064" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1711916" class="calibre22">66</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Even before Einstein moved to Berlin, he and Elsa began to correspond as if they were a couple. She worried about his exhaustion and sent him a long letter prescribing more exercise, rest, and a healthier diet. He responded by saying that he planned to “smoke like a chimney, work like a horse, eat without thinking, go for a walk <em class="calibre6">only</em> in really pleasant company.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">He made clear, however, that she should not expect him to abandon his wife: “You and I can very well be happy with each other without her having to be hurt.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos533779" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1712084" class="calibre22">67</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Indeed, even amid his flurry of love letters with Elsa, Einstein was still trying to be a suitable family man. For his August 1913 vacation, he decided to take his wife and two sons hiking with Marie Curie and her two daughters. The plan was to go through the mountains of southeastern Switzerland down to Lake Como, where he and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> had spent their most passionate and romantic moments twelve years earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre29">As it turned out, the sickly Eduard was unable to make the trip, and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> stayed behind for a few days to get him settled with friends. Then she joined them as they neared Lake Como. During the hikes, Curie challenged Einstein to name all the peaks. They also talked science, especially when the children ran ahead. At one point Einstein stopped suddenly and grabbed Curie’s arm. “You understand, what I need to know is exactly what happens to the passengers in an elevator when it falls into emptiness,” he said, referring to his ideas about the <a id="filepos534989" class="calibre3"></a>equivalence of gravity and acceleration. As Curie’s daughter noted later, “Such a touching preoccupation made the younger generation roar with laughter.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos535172" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1712271" class="calibre22">68</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein then accompanied Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> and their children to visit her family in Novi Sad and at their summer house in Ka<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>. On their final Sunday in Serbia, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> took the children, without her husband, to be baptized. Hans Albert remembered later the beautiful singing; his brother, Eduard, only 3, was disruptive. As for their father, he seemed sanguine and bemused afterward. “Do you know what the result is?” he told Hurwitz.“They’ve turned Catholic. Well, it’s all the same to me.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos535908" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1712504" class="calibre22">69</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The façade of familial harmony, however, masked the deterioration of the marriage. After his visit to Serbia and a stop in Vienna for his annual appearance at the conference of German-speaking physicists, Einstein continued on to Berlin, alone. There he was reunited with Elsa. “I now have someone I can think about with pure delight and I can live for,” he told her.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos536396" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1712886" class="calibre22">70</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Elsa’s home cooking, a hearty pleasure she lavished on him like a mother, became a theme in their letters. Their correspondence, like their relationship, was a stark contrast to that between Einstein and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> a dozen years earlier. He and Elsa tended to write to each other about domestic comforts—food, tranquillity, hygiene, fondness—rather than about romantic bliss and planted kisses, or intimacies of the soul and insights of the intellect.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Despite such conventional concerns, Einstein still fancied their relationship could avoid sinking into a mundane pattern. “How nice it would be if one of these days we could share in managing a small bohemian household,” he wrote. “You have no idea how charming such a life with very small needs and without grandeur can be!”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos537409" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713048" class="calibre22">71</a></sup> When Elsa gave him a hairbrush, he initially prided himself on his progress in personal grooming, but then he reverted to more slovenly ways and told her, only half jokingly, that it was to guard against the philistines and the bourgeoisie. Those were words he had used with Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> as well, but more earnestly.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Elsa wanted not only to domesticate Einstein but to marry him. Even before he moved to Berlin, she wrote to urge him to divorce Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>. It would become a running battle for years, until she finally won <a id="filepos538097" class="calibre3"></a>her way. But for the moment, Einstein was resistant. “Do you think,” he asked her, “it is so easy to get a divorce if one does not have any proof of the other party’s guilt?” She should accept that he had virtually separated from Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> even if he was not going to divorce her. “I treat my wife as an employee whom I cannot fire. I have my own bedroom and avoid being alone with her.” Elsa was upset that Einstein did not want to marry her, and she was fearful of how an illicit relationship would affect her daughters, but Einstein insisted it was for the best.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos538751" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713210" class="calibre22">72</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> was understandably depressed by the prospect of moving to Berlin. There she would have to deal with Einstein’s mother, who had never liked her, and his cousin, whom she rightly suspected of being a rival. In addition, Berlin had sometimes been less tolerant to Slavs than it was even to Jews. “My wife whines to me incessantly about Berlin and her fear of the relatives,” Einstein wrote Elsa. “Well, there is some truth in this.” In another letter, when he noted that Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> was afraid of her, he added, “Rightly so I hope!”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos539504" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713378" class="calibre22">73</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Indeed, by this point all of the women in his life—his mother, sister, wife, and kissing cousin—were at war with one another. As Christmas 1913 neared, Einstein’s struggle to generalize relativity had the added benefit of being a way to avoid family emotions. The effort produced yet another eloquent restatement of how science could rescue him from the merely personal. “The love of science thrives under these circumstances,” he told Elsa, “for it lifts me impersonally from the vale of tears into peaceful spheres.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos540168" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713558" class="calibre22">74</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">With the approach of the spring of 1914 and their move to Berlin, Eduard came down with an ear infection that made it necessary for Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> to take him to an Alpine resort to recover. “This has a good side,” Einstein told Elsa. He would initially be traveling to Berlin alone, and “in order to savor that,” he decided to skip a conference in Paris so that he could arrive earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre29">On one of their last evenings in Zurich, he and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> went to the Hurwitz house for a farewell musical evening. Once again, the program featured Schumann, in an attempt to cheer her up. It didn’t. She instead sat by herself in a corner and did not speak to anyone.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos541079" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713726" class="calibre22">75</a></sup></p>
<h3 class="calibre36"><span class="calibre37"><strong class="calibre12"><a id="filepos541202" class="calibre11"></a><em class="calibre35">Berlin, 1914</em></strong></span></h3><div class="calibre7"> </div>
<p class="calibre29">By April 1914, Einstein had settled into a spacious apartment just west of Berlin’s city center. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> had picked it out when she visited Berlin over Christmas vacation, and she arrived in late April, after Eduard’s ear infection had subsided.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos541603" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1713940" class="calibre22">76</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The tensions in Einstein’s domestic life were exacerbated by overwork and mental strain. He was settling into a new job—actually three new jobs—and still struggling with his fitful attempts to generalize his theory of relativity and tie it into a theory of gravity. That first April in Berlin, for example, he engaged in an intense correspondence with Paul Ehrenfest over ways to calculate the forces affecting rotating electrons in a magnetic field. He started writing a theory for such situations, then realized it was wrong. “The angel had unveiled itself halfway in its magnificence,” he told Ehrenfest, “then on further unveiling a cloven hoof appeared and I ran away.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">Even more revealing, perhaps more than he meant it to be, was his comment to Ehrenfest about his personal life in Berlin.“I really delight in my local relatives,” he reported, “especially in a cousin of my age.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos542715" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1714153" class="calibre22">77</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">When Ehrenfest came for a visit at the end of April, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> had just arrived, and he found her gloomy and yearning for Zurich. Einstein, on the other hand, had thrown himself into his work. “He had the impression that the family was taking a bit too much of his time, and that he had the duty to concentrate completely on his work,” his son Hans Albert later recollected about that fateful spring of 1914.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos543274" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1714394" class="calibre22">78</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Personal relationships involve nature’s most mysterious forces. Outside judgments are easy to make and hard to verify. Einstein repeatedly and plaintively stressed to all of their mutual friends—especially the Bessos, Habers, and Zanggers—that they should try to see the breakup of his marriage from his perspective, despite his own apparent culpability.</p>
<p class="calibre29">It is probably true that he was not solely to blame. The decline of the marriage was a downward spiral. He had become emotionally withdrawn, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> had become more depressed and dark, and each action reinforced the other. Einstein tended to avoid painful personal emotions by immersing himself in his work. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>, for her part, <a id="filepos544207" class="calibre3"></a>was bitter about the collapse of her own dreams and increasingly resentful of her husband’s success. Her jealousy made her hostile toward anyone else who was close to Einstein, including his mother (the feeling was reciprocal) and his friends. Her mistrustful nature was, understandably, to some extent an effect of Einstein’s detachment, but it was also a cause.</p>
<p class="calibre29">By the time they moved to Berlin, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> had developed at least one personal involvement of her own, with a mathematics professor in Zagreb named Vladimir Vari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>ak, who had challenged Einstein’s interpretations of how special relativity applied to a rotating disk. Einstein was aware of the situation. “He had a kind of relationship with my wife, which can’t be held against either of them,” he wrote to Zangger in June. “It only made me feel my sense of isolation doubly painfully.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos545246" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1714527" class="calibre22">79</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The end came in July. Amid the turmoil, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> moved with her two boys into the house of Fritz Haber, the chemist who’d recruited Einstein and who ran the institute where his office was located. Haber had his own experience with domestic discord. His wife, Clara, would end up committing suicide the following year after a fight over Haber’s participation in the war. But for the time being, she was Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>’s only friend in Berlin, and Fritz Haber became the intermediary as the Einsteins’ battles broke into the open.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Through the Habers, Einstein delivered to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> in mid-July a brutal cease-fire ultimatum. It was in the form of a proposed contract, one in which Einstein’s cold scientific approach combined with his personal hostility and emotional alienation to produce an astonishing document. It read in full:</p>
<p class="calibre5">Conditions.</p><div class="calibre7"> </div>

<p class="calibre45">Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> accepted the terms. When Haber delivered her response, Einstein insisted on writing to her again “so that you are completely clear about the situation.” He was prepared to live together again “because I don’t want to lose the children and I don’t want them to lose me.” It was out of the question that he would have a “friendly” relationship with her, but he would aim for a “businesslike” one. “The personal aspects must be reduced to a tiny remnant,” he said. “In return, I assure you of proper comportment on my part, such as I would exercise to any woman as a stranger.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos549090" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715146" class="calibre22">81</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Only then did Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> realize that the relationship was not salvageable. They all met at Haber’s house on a Friday to work out a separation agreement. It took three hours. Einstein agreed to provide Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> and his children 5,600 marks a year, just under half of his primary salary. Haber and Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> went to a lawyer to have the contract drawn up; Einstein did not accompany them, but instead sent his friend Michele Besso, who had come from Trieste to represent him.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos549779" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715362" class="calibre22">82</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Einstein left the meeting at Haber’s house and went directly to the home of Elsa’s parents, who were also his aunt and uncle. They arrived home late from dinner to find him there, and they received the news about the situation with “a mild distaste.” Nevertheless, he ended up staying at their house. Elsa was on summer vacation in the Bavarian Alps with her two daughters, and Einstein wrote to inform her that he was now sleeping in her bed in the apartment upstairs. “It’s peculiar how confusingly sentimental one gets,” he told her. “It is just a bed like any other, as though you had never slept in it. And yet I find it comforting.” <a id="filepos550571" class="calibre3"></a>She had invited him to visit her in the Bavarian Alps, but he said he could not, “for fear of damaging your reputation again.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos550721" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715634" class="calibre22">83</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">The way to a divorce had now been paved, he assured Elsa, and he called it “a sacrifice” he had made on her behalf. Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> would move back to Zurich and take custody of the two boys, and when they came to visit their father they could meet only on “neutral ground,” not in any house he shared with Elsa. “This is justified,” Einstein conceded to Elsa, “because it is not right to have the children see their father with a woman other than their own mother.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">The prospect of parting with his children was devastating for Einstein. He pretended to be detached from personal sentiments, and sometimes he was. But he became deeply emotional as he imagined life apart from his sons. “I would be a real monster if I felt any other way,” he wrote Elsa. “I have carried these children around innumerable times day and night, taken them out in their pram, played with them, romped around and joked with them. They used to shout with joy when I came; the little one cheered even now, because he was still too small to grasp the situation. Now they will be gone forever, and their image of their father is being spoiled.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos552101" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715796" class="calibre22">84</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> and the two boys left Berlin, accompanied by Michele Besso, aboard the morning train to Zurich on Wednesday, July 29, 1914. Haber went to the station with Einstein, who “bawled like a little boy” all afternoon and evening. It was the most wrenching personal moment for a man who took perverse pride in avoiding personal moments. For all of his reputation of being inured to deep human attachments, he had been madly in love with Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> and bonded to his children. For one of the few times in his adult life, he found himself crying.</p>
<p class="calibre29">The next day he went to visit his mother, who cheered him up. She had never liked Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> and was delighted that she was gone. “Oh, if your poor Papa had only lived to see it!” she said about the separation. She even professed herself pleased for Elsa, although they had occasionally clashed. And Elsa’s mother and father also seemed happy enough with the resolution, though they did express resentment that Einstein had been too financially generous to Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/>, which meant the income left for him and Elsa might be “a bit meager.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos553532" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1715964" class="calibre22">85</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29"><a id="filepos553631" class="calibre3"></a>The whole ordeal left Einstein so drained that, despite what he had said to Elsa just a week earlier, he decided that he was not prepared to get married again. Thus he would not have to force the issue of a legal divorce, which Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> fiercely resisted. Elsa, still on vacation, was “bitterly disappointed” by the news. Einstein sought to reassure her. “For me there is no other female creature besides you,” he wrote. “It is not a lack of true affection which scares me away again and again from marriage! Is it a fear of the comfortable life, of nice furniture, of the odium that I burden myself with or even of becoming some sort of contented bourgeois? I myself don’t know; but you will see that my attachment to you will endure.”</p>
<p class="calibre29">He insisted that she should not feel ashamed or let people pity her for consorting with a man who would not marry her. They would take walks together and be there for each other. Should she choose to offer even more, he would be grateful. But by not marrying, they would be protecting themselves from lapsing into a “contented bourgeois” existence and preventing their relationship “from becoming banal and from growing pale.” To him, marriage was confining, which was a state he instinctively resisted. “I’m glad our delicate relationship does not have to founder on a provincial narrow-minded lifestyle.”<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos555162" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1716241" class="calibre22">86</a></sup></p>
<p class="calibre29">In the old days, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> had been the type of soul mate who responded to such bohemian sentiments. Elsa was not such a person. A comfortable life with comfortable furniture appealed to her. So did marriage. She would accept his decision not to get married for a while, but not forever.</p>
<p class="calibre29">In the meantime, Einstein became embroiled in a long-distance battle with Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre8"/> over money, furniture, and the way she was allegedly “poisoning” their children against him.<sup class="calibre26"><a id="filepos555868" class="calibre3"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1716408" class="calibre22">87</a></sup> And all around them, a chain reaction was taking Europe into the most incomprehensibly bloody war in its history.</p>
<p class="calibre29">Not surprisingly, Einstein reacted to all of this turmoil by throwing himself into his science.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_36"></div></body>
