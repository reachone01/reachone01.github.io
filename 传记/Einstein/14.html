Einstein’s 1905 burst of creativity was astonishing. He had devised a revolutionary quantum theory of light, helped prove the existence of atoms, explained Brownian motion, upended the concept of space and time, and produced what would become science’s best known equation. But not many people seemed to notice at first. According to his sister, Einstein had hoped that his flurry of essays in a preeminent journal would lift him from the obscurity of a third-class patent examiner and provide some academic recognition, perhaps even an academic job. “But he was bitterly disappointed,” she noted. “Icy silence followed the publication.”<sup><a id="filepos418418"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1685862">1</a></sup>

爱因斯坦1905年迸发出的创造力实在令人惊讶。他提出了一种革命性的光量子理论，间接证明了原子的存在，解释了布朗运动，颠覆了时间、空间概念，提出了科学上最著名的方程。但起初这些成果并没有引起多少人注意。据妹妹说，爱因斯坦曾经希望他在这家优秀期刊上发表的一系列文章能够将他从一个卑微的三级专利审查员提升到更高职位，并且在一定程度上得到学术界认可，甚至帮他跻身学术界。“但他大失所望，”她说，“文章发表之后是一片寂静。”

That was not exactly true. A small but respectable handful of physicists soon took note of Einstein’s papers, and one of these turned out to be, as good fortune would have it, the most important possible admirer he could attract: Max Planck, Europe’s revered monarch of theoretical physics, whose mysterious mathematical constant explaining black-body radiation Einstein had transformed into a radical new reality of nature. As the editorial board member of <em>Annalen der Physik</em> responsible for theoretical submissions, Planck had vetted Einstein’s papers, and the one on relativity had “immediately aroused my lively attention,” he later recalled. As soon as it was published, Planck gave a lecture on relativity at the University of Berlin.<sup><a id="filepos419300"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1686001">2</a></sup>

<p>
这并非完全符合事实。少数颇有名望的物理学家很快就注意到了爱因斯坦的论文。也许是命运眷顾，其中一位后来成了爱因斯坦最重要的支持者，那就是欧洲德高望重的理论物理学巨擘——普朗克，能够得到他的赏识真是再理想不过了。普朗克用他那神秘的数学常量解释了黑体辐射，爱因斯坦则把这个常量锻造成全新的物理实在。作为《物理学纪事》负责理论文章的编委，普朗克审阅了爱因斯坦的论文，他后来回忆说，那篇相对论论文“立即引起我极大的关注”。它一发表，普朗克就在柏林大学做了一场关于相对论的讲演。

<a id="filepos419398"></a>Planck became the first physicist to build on Einstein’s theory. In an article published in the spring of 1906, he argued that relativity conformed to the principle of least action, a foundation of physics that holds that light or any object moving between two points should follow the easiest path.<sup><a id="filepos419715"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1686247">3</a></sup>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

普朗克是第一位公开支持爱因斯坦理论的物理学家。在1906年春季发表的一篇文章中，他认为相对论符合物理学的一条基本原理——最小作用量原理，即在两点之间运动的光或物体总会沿着最简单的路径前进。

Planck’s paper not only contributed to the development of relativity theory; it also helped to legitimize it among other physicists. Whatever disappointment Maja Einstein had detected in her brother dissipated. “My papers are much appreciated and are giving rise to further investigations,” he exulted to Solovine. “Professor Planck has recently written to me about that.”<sup><a id="filepos420220"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1686801">4</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
普朗克的文章不仅推动了相对论的发展，而且有助于其他物理学家接受它。玛雅在哥哥脸上看到的愁云消散了。“我的论文颇得赏识，正在接受进一步评阅，”他幸福地对索洛文说，“普朗克教授最近给我写信谈了这些情况。”

The proud patent examiner was soon exchanging letters with the eminent professor. When another theorist challenged Planck’s contention that relativity theory conformed to the principle of least action, Einstein took Planck’s side and sent him a card saying so. Planck was pleased. “As long as the proponents of the principle of relativity constitute such a modest little band as is now the case,” he replied to Einstein, “it is doubly important that they agree among themselves.” He added that he hoped to visit Bern the following year and meet Einstein personally.<sup><a id="filepos420924"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687031">5</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
没过多久，这位踌躇满志的专利审查员就与著名的普朗克教授开始了通信。当时有一位理论物理学家挑战普朗克的观点，认为相对论并不符合最小作用量原理，爱因斯坦寄给普朗克一张明信片，对他表示支持。普朗克很高兴，他给爱因斯坦回信说：“只要相对性原理的捍卫者们是一小群如此谦逊之士，就像现在这样，那么他们之间保持一致就具有双倍的重要性。”他还说希望第二年能够访问伯尔尼，亲自与爱因斯坦会面。

Planck did not end up coming to Bern, but he did send his earnest assistant, Max Laue.<a id="filepos421108"></a><a href="Einstein_split_050.html#filepos2410587">*</a> He and Einstein had already been corresponding about Einstein’s light quanta paper, with Laue saying that he agreed with “your heuristic view that radiation can be absorbed and emitted only in specific finite quanta.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
普朗克后来没能前往伯尔尼，不过还是派他认真尽责的助手马克斯·冯·劳厄去了。此前，劳厄曾经多次与爱因斯坦通信讨论其光量子论文。劳厄赞同爱因斯坦“那极富启发性的观点，即辐射只能以特定的有限量子被吸收和发射”。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

However, Laue insisted, just as Planck had, that Einstein was wrong to assume that these quanta were a characteristic of the radiation itself. Instead, Laue contended that the quanta were merely a description of the way that radiation was emitted or absorbed by a piece of matter. “This is not a characteristic of electromagnetic processes in a vacuum but rather of the emitting or absorbing matter,” Laue wrote, “and hence radiation does not consist of light quanta as it says in section six of your first paper.”<sup><a id="filepos421979"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687207">6</a></sup> (In that section, Einstein had said that the radiation “behaves thermodynamically as if it consisted of mutually independent energy quanta.”)
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


不过，劳厄和普朗克都认为，爱因斯坦错误地假定这些量子是辐射本身的一种特征。劳厄主张，量子仅仅是对物质发射或吸收辐射的一种描述方式。“它不是真空中电磁过程的特征，而是发射或吸收物质的特征，”劳厄写道，“因而辐射并非像您在第一篇论文第六节中所说的那样是由光量子构成的。” （爱因斯坦在第六节中说，辐射“从热力学上看，就像是由相互独立的能量子所构成一样”。）

<a id="filepos422231"></a>When Laue was preparing to visit in the summer of 1907, he was surprised to discover that Einstein was not at the University of Bern but was working at the patent office on the third floor of the Post and Telegraph Building. Meeting Einstein there did not lessen his wonder. “The young man who came to meet me made so unexpected an impression on me that I did not believe he could possibly be the father of the relativity theory,” Laue said, “so I let him pass.” After a while, Einstein came wandering through the reception area again, and Laue finally realized who he was.

<p>
劳厄在准备1907年夏天的访问时惊奇地发现，爱因斯坦并不在伯尔尼大学工作，而是在位于邮政电报大楼三层的专利局任职。当时的场景依然使他感到好奇。“一个年轻人向我走来，但他与我的预期相差太大了，我不相信他就是相对论的创始人，”劳厄说，“所以我没跟他打招呼。”过不多时，爱因斯坦又一次缓步走过接待处，劳厄总算明白他是谁了。

They walked and talked for hours, with Einstein at one point offering a cigar that, Laue recalled, “was so unpleasant that I ‘accidentally’ dropped it into the river.” Einstein’s theories, on the other hand, made a pleasing impression. “During the first two hours of our conversation he overthrew the entire mechanics and electrodynamics,” Laue noted. Indeed, he was so enthralled that over the next four years he would publish eight papers on Einstein’s relativity theory and become a close friend.<sup><a id="filepos423444"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687362">7</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
他们边走边谈，时间一晃过去了几小时。爱因斯坦递给他一支雪茄，劳厄回忆说：“它难闻极了，我‘不慎’将它丢到了河里。”而爱因斯坦的理论则很让人愉快。“在我们交谈的前两小时里，他推翻了整个力学和电动力学。”劳厄指出。事实上，他完全入了迷，以至于在接下来的四年里，他发表了关于爱因斯坦相对论的八篇论文，并成为爱因斯坦的密友。

Some theorists found the amazing flurry of papers from the patent office to be uncomfortably abstract. Arnold Sommerfeld, later a friend, was among the first to suggest there was something Jewish about Einstein’s theoretical approach, a theme later picked up by anti-Semites. It lacked due respect for the notion of order and absolutes, and it did not seem solidly grounded. “As remarkable as Einstein’s papers are,” he wrote Lorentz in 1907, “it still seems to me that something almost unhealthy lies in this unconstruable and impossible to visualize dogma. An Englishman would hardly have given us this theory. It might be here too, as in the case of Cohn, the abstract conceptual character of the Semite expresses itself.”<sup><a id="filepos424308"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687537">8</a></sup>

有些理论物理学家觉得这位专利审查员写的一系列令人惊讶的论文过于抽象。后来成为爱因斯坦朋友的阿诺德·索默菲很早就暗示，爱因斯坦的理论倾向有些犹太味道，后来这一点被反犹主义者拿来大做文章。这种倾向缺乏对秩序和绝对事物的必要尊重，缺乏严格的基础。“尽管爱因斯坦的论文引人注目，”索默菲1907年给洛伦兹写信说，“但在我看来，这种难以破解和洞悉的教条之中存在着某种不健康的东西。英国人就不大可能提出这样一种理论。在这里，或许就和科恩一样，犹太人抽象的概念特征表露无遗。”

None of this interest made Einstein famous, nor did it get him any job offers. “I was surprised to read that you must sit in an office for eight hours a day,” wrote yet another young physicist who was planning to visit. “History is full of bad jokes.”<sup><a id="filepos424686"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1687959">9</a></sup> But because he had finally earned his doctorate, he had at least gotten promoted from a third-class <a id="filepos424828"></a>to a second-class technical expert at the patent office, which came with a hefty 1,000-franc raise to an annual salary of 4,500 francs.<sup><a id="filepos424975"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688116">10</a></sup>

这些关注并没有使爱因斯坦出名，也没有给他带来任何工作机会。“我惊奇地得知，你一天必须在办公室里坐满八小时，”一名要来访问的年轻物理学家这样写道，“历史总是充满着恶搞（bad jokes）。” 不过，由于爱因斯坦最终得到了博士学位，所以他至少由专利局的三级技术专家升至二级，薪水也增加了1000法郎，达到年薪4500法郎。

His productivity was startling. In addition to working six days a week at the patent office, he continued his torrent of papers and reviews: six in 1906 and ten more in 1907. At least once a week he played in a string quartet. And he was a good father to the 3-year-old son he proudly labeled “impertinent.” As Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> wrote to her friend Helene Savi<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, “My husband often spends his free time at home just playing with the boy.”<sup><a id="filepos425606"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688284">11</a></sup>

Beginning in the summer of 1907, Einstein also found time to dabble in what might have become, if the fates had been more impish, a new career path: as an inventor and salesman of electrical devices like his uncle and father. Working with Olympia Academy member Conrad Habicht and his brother Paul, Einstein developed a machine to amplify tiny electrical charges so they could be measured and studied. It had more academic than practical purpose; the idea was to create a lab device that would permit the study of small electrical fluctuations.

从1907年夏天开始，爱因斯坦还抽空做了其他事情，如果命运更加弄人，那么他很可能会走上一条全新的职业道路，那就是像他舅舅和父亲那样做一个发明家和电气设备的销售商。爱因斯坦和哈比希特及其兄弟保罗合作设计了一台放大微弱电荷的机器，使之能够被检测和研究。它更多的是服务于学术研究而非实用。他们的初衷是发明一套实验室设备来研究微小的电涨落。

The concept was simple. When two strips of metal move close to each other, an electric charge on one will induce an opposite charge on the other. Einstein’s idea was to use a series of strips that would induce the charge ten times and then transfer that to another disc. The process would be repeated until the original minuscule charge would be multiplied by a large number and thus be easily measurable. The trick was making the contraption actually work.<sup><a id="filepos426774"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688530">12</a></sup>

其思想很简单。当两个金属棒彼此靠近时，一方的电荷会在另一方感应出相反的电荷。爱因斯坦的想法是：用若干金属棒感应出10倍的电荷，再将它们转移到另一个圆盘上。重复这一过程，直到最初的微弱电荷被放大许多倍，很容易检测为止。关键在于如何让整个装置运转起来。

Given his heritage, breeding, and years in the patent office, Einstein had the background to be an engineering genius. But as it turned out, he was better suited to theorizing. Fortunately, Paul Habicht was a good machinist, and by August 1907 he had a prototype of the <em>Maschinchen,</em> or little machine, ready to be unveiled. “I am astounded at the lightning speed with which you built the <em>Maschinchen,</em>” Einstein wrote. “I’ll show up on Sunday.” Unfortunately, it didn’t work. “I am driven by <em>murderous</em> curiosity as to what you’re up to,” Einstein wrote a month later as they tried to fix things.

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
无论是家庭传统、所受的教育，还是专利局的工作，爱因斯坦都有足够的背景成为天才的工程师。但后来的事实表明，他更适合做理论研究。幸运的是，保罗·哈比希特是一个优秀的机械师，到1907年8月，他已经有一个“小机器”（Maschinchen）的样品要问世了。“你闪电般地造出了小机器，真使我大吃一惊，”爱因斯坦写道，“我星期天会来。”不幸的是，小机器出了点毛病。“我迫不及待地想知道你在做什么。”爱因斯坦一个月后写信说，那时他们正在维修。

Throughout 1908, letters flew back and forth between Einstein and the Habichts, filled with complex diagrams and a torrent of ideas for <a id="filepos427741"></a>how to make the device work. Einstein published a description in a journal, which produced, for a while, a potential sponsor. Paul Habicht was able to build a better version by October, but it had trouble keeping a charge. He brought the machine to Bern, where Einstein commandeered a lab in one of the schools and dragooned a local mechanic. By November the machine seemed to be working. It took another year or so to get a patent and begin to make some versions for sale. But even then, it never truly caught hold or found a market, and Einstein eventually lost interest.<sup><a id="filepos428326"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1688798">13</a></sup>

整个1908年，爱因斯坦与哈比希特兄弟书信频繁，文中夹杂着各种复杂图表和让设备运转的想法。爱因斯坦在一家杂志上刊登了一张设计图，这张图曾引来一家大赞助商。到了10月，保罗改进了机器，但供电方面又出了问题。他将机器带到伯尔尼，爱因斯坦征用了学校的一间实验室，找了当地的一名技工帮忙。到了11月，机器似乎可以工作了。他们又花了一年左右的时间才获得专利并开始制造和销售。但即使在那时，他们也没能真正占领市场或找到买家，爱因斯坦最终失去了兴趣。

These practical exploits may have been fun, but Einstein’s glorious isolation from the priesthood of academic physicists was starting to have more drawbacks than advantages. In a paper he wrote in the spring of 1907, he began by exuding a joyful self-assurance about having neither the library nor the inclination to know what other theorists had written on the topic. “Other authors might have already clarified part of what I am going to say,” he wrote. “I felt I could dispense with doing a literature search (which would have been very troublesome for me), especially since there is good reason to hope that others will fill this gap.” However, when he was commissioned to write a major year-book piece on relativity later that year, there was slightly less cockiness in his warning to the editor that he might not be aware of all the literature. “Unfortunately I am not in a position to acquaint myself about everything that has been published on this subject,” he wrote, “because the library is closed in my free time.”<sup><a id="filepos429509"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1689112">14</a></sup>

这些应用方面的探索或许挺有意思，但渐渐地，爱因斯坦与物理学界的极度隔绝开始弊大于利。在1907年春的一篇论文中，他一开篇便显露出得意扬扬的自信，说他那里既没有图书馆，也没想知道其他理论家就这一主题写过什么。“其他作者可能已经阐明了我将要说的部分内容，”他写道，“我感到我的文献综述可以被豁免（这对我来说是十分麻烦的事），特别是因为很有理由希望其他作者会来弥补这一缺陷。”然而过了不久，当他应一本年鉴之邀写一篇关于相对论的长文时，他的得意已经有所收敛。他提醒编辑说，他对相关文献掌握得不够全面。“不幸的是，我本人无法完全了解关于这一主题的所有发表著作，”他写道，“因为在我空闲的时候图书馆就闭馆了。”

That year he applied for a position at the University of Bern as a <em>privatdozent,</em> a starter rung on the academic ladder, which involved giving lectures and collecting a small fee from anyone who felt like showing up. To become a professor at most European universities, it helped to serve such an apprenticeship. With his application Einstein enclosed seventeen papers he had published, including the ones on relativity and light quanta. He was also expected to include an unpublished paper known as a <em>habilitation</em> thesis, but he decided not to bother writing one, as this requirement was sometimes waived for those who had “other outstanding achievements.”

那一年，他申请了伯尔尼大学的无俸讲师职位，这是攀爬学术阶梯的第一步。爱因斯坦需要通过授课而从听众那里收取一点钱。在大多数欧洲大学里，要想成为教授，做一段时间这样的讲师是有益的。爱因斯坦随申请附上了已经发表的17篇论文，包括关于相对论和光量子的论文。照理说，他也应当附上一篇尚未发表的论文作为教职论文，但他不想再特地写一篇，因为对于那些有着“其他杰出成就”的人来说，有时可以不做要。

Einstein’s road to the general theory of relativity began in November 1907, when he was struggling against a deadline to finish an article for a science yearbook explaining his special theory of relativity. Two limitations of that theory still bothered him: it applied only to uniform constant-velocity motion (things felt and behaved differently if your speed or direction was changing), and it did not incorporate Newton’s theory of gravity.

“I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a sudden a thought occurred to me,” he recalled. “If a person falls freely, he will not feel his own weight.”That realization, which “startled” him, launched him on an arduous eight-year effort to generalize his special theory of relativity and “impelled me toward a theory of gravitation.”<sup><a id="filepos431922"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1689601">16</a></sup> Later, he would grandly call it “the happiest<a id="filepos432016"></a><a href="Einstein_split_051.html#filepos2410784">*</a> thought in my life.”<sup><a id="filepos432083"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1689737">17</a></sup>

这个下落的人的故事后来被说得绘声绘色，在有些版本中，其主人公成了从专利局附近的公寓大楼房顶上跌落下来的一个画家。 事实上，就像伽利略从比萨斜塔上扔下重物，苹果落在牛顿头上 等关于引力发现的传闻一样，这个故事也在口口相传中被不断加工，它更是一个思想实验而不是真实事件。尽管爱因斯坦倾向于关注科学，而不是仅仅与个人相关的事情，但他不大可能在亲眼见到真人从房顶跌落下来的同时想到引力理论，更不至于把这称为一生中最幸福的思想。

Einstein refined his thought experiment so that the falling man was in an enclosed chamber, such as an elevator in free fall above the earth. In this falling chamber (at least until it crashed), the man would feel weightless. Any objects he emptied from his pocket and let loose would float alongside him.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦进一步改进了他的思想实验。这时下落的人位于一个密闭舱内，比如在地球上空做自由落体运动的升降机。在这个下落的密闭舱里（至少在它坠毁之前），这个人感受不到任何重力。如果他从口袋里掏出东西并且放手，这些东西将会随他一起飘游。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos433382"></a>Looking at it another way, Einstein imagined a man in an enclosed chamber floating in deep space “far removed from stars and other appreciable masses.” He would experience the same perceptions of weightlessness. “Gravitation naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
以另一种方式来看，爱因斯坦设想密闭舱里的人在太空中飘游，“远离星体和其他大质量”，那么他将体验到同样的失重感。“对于这个观察者而言，引力当然并不存在。他必须用绳子将自己拴在地板上，否则他只要轻轻碰一下地板，就会朝天花板慢慢升起。”



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Then Einstein imagined that a rope was hooked onto the roof of the chamber and pulled up with a constant force. “The chamber together with the observer then begin to move ‘upwards’ with a uniformly accelerated motion.”The man inside will feel himself pressed to the floor. “He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of a house on our earth.” If he pulls something from his pocket and lets go, it will fall to the floor “with an accelerated relative motion” that is the same no matter the weight of the object—just as Galileo discovered to be the case for gravity. “The man in the chamber will thus come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational field. Of course he will be puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this gravitational field. Just then, however, he discovers the hook in the middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it, and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chamber is suspended at rest in the gravitational field.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
接着，爱因斯坦设想有一根绳索钩住了密闭舱的顶部，并以恒定的力去拉它。“于是，舱连同观察者开始以匀加速运动‘向上’升起。”舱里的人将会感到自己被压向地板。“他站在舱里实际上与站在地球的房间里完全一样。”如果他释放口袋里的一个物体，不论物体的重量如何，它都会“以一种加速的相对运动”落向地板，就像伽利略发现的引力情形一样。“舱里的人将会断定，他和舱正处于引力场中。当然他会暂时感到迷惑不解，为什么舱在这个引力场中并不下落。但正在这时，他忽然发现舱盖正中有一个系着缆索的钩子，于是他就得出结论说，舱是静止地悬挂在引力场中的。”

“Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion?” Einstein asked. Just as with special relativity, there was no right or wrong perception. “We must rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws.”<sup><a id="filepos435362"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1690660">20</a></sup>

“我们是否应该讥笑这个人，说他的结论错了呢？”爱因斯坦问。和狭义相对论的情况一样，知觉并无对错可言。“我们反而必须承认，他的思想方法既不违反理性，也不违反已知的力学定律。”

A related way that Einstein addressed this same issue was typical of his ingenuity: he examined a phenomenon that was so very well-known that scientists rarely puzzled about it. Every object has a “gravitational mass,” which determines its weight on the earth’s surface or, more generally, the tug between it and any other object. It also has an “inertial mass,” which determines how much force must be applied to it in order to make it accelerate. As Newton noted, the inertial mass of <a id="filepos435978"></a>an object is always the same as its gravitational mass, even though they are defined differently. This was obviously more than a mere coincidence, but no one had fully explained why.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦还用另一种方式提出了同一问题，充分展露了他的才智和洞见。他注意到这样一个现象，由于它过于司空见惯，以至于科学家很少为它费过心思。这个现象就是：每个物体都有一个“引力质量”，“引力质量”决定了物体在地球表面的重量，或者更一般地说，决定了它与其他物体之间的吸引；物体还有一个“惯性质量”，“惯性质量”决定了使物体加速需要施予多大的力。牛顿注意到，虽然惯性质量与引力质量的定义完全不同，但物体的惯性质量与引力质量却总是相等。这显然并非巧合，但从未有人很好地解释过其中的原因。

Uncomfortable with two explanations for what seemed to be one phenomenon, Einstein probed the equivalence of inertial mass and gravitational mass using his thought experiment. If we imagine that the enclosed elevator is being accelerated upward in a region of outer space where there is no gravity, then the downward force felt by the man inside (or the force that tugs downward on an object hanging from the ceiling by a string) is due to <em>inertial</em> mass. If we imagine that the enclosed elevator is at rest in a gravitational field, then the downward force felt by the man inside (or the force that tugs downward on an object hanging from the ceiling by a string) is due to <em>gravitational</em> mass. But inertial mass always equals gravitational mass. “From this correspondence,” said Einstein, “it follows that it is impossible to discover by experiment whether a given system of coordinates is accelerated, or whether . . . the observed effects are due to a gravitational field.”<sup><a id="filepos437246"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1690807">21</a></sup>

同一现象竟然可以给出两种不同解释，爱因斯坦对此深感不安，他用思想实验考察了惯性质量与引力质量的等效。设想一台封闭的升降机正在没有重力的外太空加速向上运动，那么升降机内部的人所感受到的向下的力（或被绳索悬挂在天花板上的物体所受到的向下的拖曳力）乃是起因于惯性质量。而如果封闭的升降机静止于引力场中，那么升降机内部的人所感受到的向下的力（或被绳索悬挂在天花板上的物体所受到的向下的拖曳力）乃是起因于引力质量。而惯性质量总是等于引力质量。“由这种对应可知，”爱因斯坦说，“不可能通过实验来发现某一坐标系是否在加速，或者……所观察到的效应是否由引力场所引起。”

Einstein called this “the equivalence principle.”<sup><a id="filepos437411"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1691068">22</a></sup> The local effects of gravity and of acceleration are equivalent. This became a foundation for his attempt to generalize his theory of relativity so that it was not restricted just to systems that moved with a uniform velocity. The basic insight that he would develop over the next eight years was that “the effects we ascribe to gravity and the effects we ascribe to acceleration are both produced by one and the same structure.”<sup><a id="filepos437900"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1691377">23</a></sup>

爱因斯坦把这称为“等效原理”。 就产生的局域效应而言，引力与加速是等效的。正是基于等效原理，他才把相对论推广到非匀速运动系统。在接下来的八年中，他发展的根本洞见就在于，“我们所谓的引力效应和加速效应都是由同一结构产生的”。

In November 1907, working against the deadline imposed by the <em>Yearbook of Radioactivity and Electronics,</em> Einstein tacked on a fifth section to his article on relativity that sketched out his new ideas. “So far we have applied the principle of relativity ...only to nonaccelerated reference systems,” he began. “Is it conceivable that the principle of relativity applies to systems that are accelerated relative to each other?”

Using various mathematical calculations that can be made about an accelerated system, Einstein proceeded to show that, if his notions were correct, clocks would run more slowly in a more intense gravitational field. He also came up with many predictions that could be tested, including that light should be bent by gravity and that the wavelength of light emitted from a source with a large mass, such as the sun, should increase slightly in what has become known as the gravitational redshift. “On the basis of some ruminating, which, though daring, does have something going for it, I have arrived at the view that the gravitational difference might be the cause of the shift to the red end of the spectrum,” he explained to a colleague. “A bending of light rays by gravity also follows from these arguments.”<sup><a id="filepos441385"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1691758">25</a></sup>

通过对加速系统做各种数学计算，爱因斯坦进而表明，如果他的观点是正确的，那么在较强的引力场中，时钟将会变慢。他还提出了许多预言以供检验，比如光线会在引力作用下发生偏折，从太阳这样的大质量光源发出的光的波长会稍有增加，即所谓的引力红移现象。“经过某种虽然大胆但确实有所收获的思考，我得出了这样的见解，即引力势差也许是谱线红移的原因，”他向一位同事解释说，“通过这些论证还可以得出以下结论：引力场会使光线发生偏折。”

By the beginning of 1908, even as such academic stars as Max Planck and Wilhelm Wien were writing to ask for his insights, Einstein had tempered his aspirations to be a university professor. Instead, he had begun, believe it or not, to seek work as a high school teacher. “This craving,” he told Marcel Grossmann, who had helped him get the patent-office job, “comes only from my ardent wish to be able to continue my private scientific work under easier conditions.”

到了1908年年初，就连普朗克和维恩这样的学界名流都在试图了解爱因斯坦思想洞见的时候，他却不像以前那样强烈渴望成为大学教授了。信不信由你，他想到一所高中当老师。他对帮他找到专利局工作的格罗斯曼说：“这种想法仅仅是出于一种强烈的愿望，即能够在更宽松的条件下继续我个人的科学工作。”

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

He was even eager to go back to the Technical School in Winter-hur, where he had briefly been a substitute teacher. “How does one go about this?” he asked Grossmann. “Could I possibly call on somebody and talk him into the great worth of my admirable person as a teacher and a citizen? Wouldn’t I make a bad impression on him (no Swiss-German dialect, my Semitic appearance, etc.)?” He had written papers that were transforming physics, but he did not know if that would help. “Would there be any point in my stressing my scientific papers on that occasion?”<sup><a id="filepos443330"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692091">26</a></sup>
</p>

他甚至渴望回到曾经短期代人授课的温特图尔的技术学校。“这样做怎么样？”他问格罗斯曼，“我也许应该找个什么人亲自证明我作为教师和公民的极好品质很有价值？我会不会给他留下什么不好的印象呢（比如不是瑞士籍德国人，长着一副犹太人的面孔等）？”他写的几篇论文正在改变物理学的面貌，但他不知道这是否帮得上忙。“此时强调一下我的科学论文是否有意义呢？”

He also responded to an advertisement for a “teacher of mathematics and descriptive geometry” at a high school in Zurich, noting in his application “that I would be ready to teach physics as well.” He ended up deciding to enclose all of the papers he had written thus far, including the special theory of relativity. There were twenty-one applicants. Einstein did not even make the list of three finalists.<sup><a id="filepos443864"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692255">27</a></sup>

So Einstein finally overcame his pride and decided to write a thesis in order to become a <em>privatdozent</em> at Bern. As he explained to the patron there who had supported him, “The conversation I had with you in the city library, as well as the advice of several friends, has induced <a id="filepos444257"></a>me to change my decision for the second time and to try my luck with a <em>habilitation</em> at the University of Bern after all.”<sup><a id="filepos444405"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1692454">28</a></sup>

By the summer of 1909, Stern was the only attendee, and Einstein canceled his lecturing.

It was not a full professorship; instead, it was an associate professorship under Kleiner.

克莱纳是苏黎世大学的物理教授，曾帮助爱因斯坦获得博士学位，也曾鼓励他申请无俸讲师一职。 他还做过长时间的努力（1908年获得了成功），劝说苏黎世主管部门设立新的理论物理学职位以提高大学的声望。这并不是一个正教授职位，而是一个由莱纳掌控的副教授职位。

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

It was the obvious post for Einstein, but there was one obstacle. Kleiner had another candidate in mind: his assistant Friedrich Adler, a pale and passionate political activist who had become friends with Einstein when they were both at the Polytechnic. Adler, whose father was the leader of the Social Democratic Party in Austria, was more disposed to political philosophy than theoretical physics. So he went to see Kleiner one morning in June 1908, and the two of them concluded that Adler was not right for the job and Einstein was.

<p>



对爱因斯坦来说，这个职位的意义是不言而喻的，但有一个障碍。克莱纳还想到了另一个候选人：他的助手阿德勒，一个面色苍白、充满激情的政治活动家，他和爱因斯坦在联邦工学院时就是朋友。阿德勒的父亲是奥地利社会民主党的领导人，阿德勒更喜欢政治哲学而不是理论物理学。所以1908年6月的一天早上，他去见了克莱纳。两人的结论是，爱因斯坦比阿德勒更适合这一职位。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

In a letter to his father, Adler recounted the conversation and said that Einstein “had no understanding how to relate to people” and had been “treated by the professors at the Polytechnic with outright contempt.” <a id="filepos447076"></a>But Adler said he deserved the job because of his genius and was likely to get it. “They have a bad conscience over how they treated him earlier.

在给父亲的一封信中，阿德勒记述了这次谈话，说爱因斯坦“不懂得如何与人相处”，曾经“遭到联邦工学院教授们的冷遇”。但阿德勒说，他是天才，理应获得这一职位，而且很有希望获得。“他们为自己以前对待爱因斯坦的方式感到内疚。无论在这里还是在德国，都有人恶意诽谤，说这样一个人只能在专利局坐班。”

Adler made sure that the Zurich authorities, and for that matter everyone else, knew that he was officially stepping aside for his friend. “If it is possible to get a man like Einstein for our university, it would be absurd to appoint me,” he wrote. That resolved the political issue for the councilor in charge of education, who was a partisan Social Democrat. “Ernst would have liked Adler, since he was a fellow party member,” Einstein explained to Michele Besso. “But Adler’s statements about himself and me made it impossible.”<sup><a id="filepos448035"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693335">32</a></sup>

<p>
阿德勒要让苏黎世主管部门以及所有人都知道，自己正急流勇退给朋友让路。“如果我们的大学能够得到像爱因斯坦这样的人，任命我就是荒谬的。”他写道。当时主管教育的政务会委员是一个社会民主党员，对他而言，这番话化解了政治矛盾。“斯特恩本来可能会喜欢阿德勒，因为他是党员，”爱因斯坦向贝索解释说，“但阿德勒关于他自己和我的说法使这成为不可能。”

So, at the end of June 1908, Kleiner traveled from Zurich to Bern to audit one of Einstein’s <em>privatdozent</em> lectures and, as Einstein put it, “size up the beast.” Alas, it was not a great show. “I really did not lecture divinely,” Einstein lamented to a friend, “partly because I was not well prepared, partly because being investigated got on my nerves a bit.” Kleiner sat listening with a wrinkled brow, and after the lecture he informed Einstein that his teaching style was not good enough to qualify him for the professorship. Einstein calmly claimed that he considered the job “quite unnecessary.”<sup><a id="filepos448802"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693513">33</a></sup>

于是，1908年6月底，克莱纳专程从苏黎世到伯尔尼听爱因斯坦讲课。正如爱因斯坦所说，“讲得很蹩脚”。可惜，这次亮相并不出彩。“那次我讲得的确不太好，”爱因斯坦遗憾地对一位朋友说，“一方面我准备得不充分，一方面处于被考查的状态使我感到有些紧张。”克莱纳坐在那里，眉头紧锁地听着，下课之后他告诉爱因斯坦，他的讲课风格不足以使他升任教授。爱因斯坦平静地说，他认为这个职位“可有可无”。

Kleiner went back to Zurich and reported that Einstein “holds monologues” and was “a long way from being a teacher.” That seemed to end his chances. As Adler informed his powerful father, “The situation has therefore changed, and the Einstein business is closed.” Einstein pretended to be sanguine. “The business with the professorship fell through, but that’s all right with me,” he wrote a friend. “There are enough teachers even without me.”<sup><a id="filepos449416"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693683">34</a></sup>

克莱纳回到苏黎世，说爱因斯坦“只顾唱独角戏”，“距离一名教师还有很长的路要走”。他的机会似乎已经渺茫。正像阿德勒对父亲说的那样，“情况就这样发生了变化，爱因斯坦前景不妙”。爱因斯坦只能强作笑脸。“教授职位一事已成泡影，不过我没事，”他给一位朋友写信说，“即使没有我，那里的教师也足够了。”

In fact Einstein was upset, and he became even more so when he heard that Kleiner’s criticism of his teaching skills was being widely circulated, even in Germany. So he wrote to Kleiner, angrily reproaching him “for spreading unfavorable rumors about me.” He was already finding it difficult to get a proper academic job, and Kleiner’s assessment would make it impossible.

事实上，爱因斯坦的情绪十分低落，当他听说克莱纳对其授课技巧的批评已经在德国广为流传之后就更是沮丧。于是他写信给克莱纳，严厉谴责他“散布对我很不利的谣言”。他发现要找到一个正规的学术职位已很困难，而克莱纳雪上加霜的评价会使这一切更加成为泡影。

There was some validity to Kleiner’s criticism. Einstein was never an inspired teacher, and his lectures tended to be regarded as disorganized <a id="filepos450117"></a>until his celebrity ensured that every stumble he made was transformed into a charming anecdote. Nevertheless, Kleiner relented. He said that he would be pleased to help him get the Zurich job if he could only show “some teaching ability.”

克莱纳的批评并非毫无道理。事实上，爱因斯坦从来也不是富有启发力的教师。一般认为，他的授课比较散乱。只是在名扬天下之后，他上课时的每一次支吾和磕绊才成为美谈。然而，克莱纳发了慈悲。他说如果爱因斯坦能够表现出“一定的教学能力”，他将乐于帮助其获得苏黎世的工作。

Einstein replied by suggesting that he come to Zurich to give a full-fledged (and presumably well-prepared) lecture to the physics society there, which he did in February 1909. “I was lucky,” Einstein reported soon after. “Contrary to my habit, I lectured well on that occasion.”<sup><a id="filepos450740"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1693889">35</a></sup> When he went to call on Kleiner afterward, the professor intimated that a job offer would soon follow.

爱因斯坦在回信中表示，他将到苏黎世为当地的物理学会做一次正式的（大概也是做了充分准备的）讲演。1909年2月，他做了这次讲演。“我很幸运，”这之后不久爱因斯坦说，“与往常不同，那次我讲得很好。” 当他后来拜访克莱纳时，教授明确表示他很快会获得这份工作。

A few days after Einstein returned to Bern, Kleiner provided his official recommendation to the University of Zurich faculty. “Einstein ranks among the most important theoretical physicists and has been recognized as such since his work on the relativity principle,” he wrote. As for Einstein’s teaching skills, he said as politely as possible that they were ripe for improvement: “Dr. Einstein will prove his worth also as a teacher, because he is too intelligent and too conscientious not to be open to advice when necessary.”<sup><a id="filepos451505"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694047">36</a></sup>

爱因斯坦回到伯尔尼之后没几天，克莱纳就向苏黎世大学的全体教员提交了他的正式推荐信。“爱因斯坦当属最重要的理论物理学家之一，自从他关于相对性原理的工作发表之后就已得到公认。”他写道。至于爱因斯坦的教学能力，他尽可能客气地说，改进的时机已经成熟：“爱因斯坦博士也能证明他作为教师的价值。他才智出众，认真负责，在必要时不会不听取建议。”

One issue was Einstein’s Jewishness. Some faculty members considered this a potential problem, but they were assured by Kleiner that Einstein did not exhibit the “unpleasant peculiarities” supposedly associated with Jews. Their conclusion is a revealing look at both the anti-Semitism of the time and the attempts to rise above it:

有些教员认为，爱因斯坦的犹太人身份是一个潜在的问题，但克莱纳使他们确信，爱因斯坦不会表现出那些与犹太人联系在一起的“令人不快的性格特征”。他们的结论是当时愈演愈烈的反犹主义的生动写照：

The expressions of our colleague Kleiner, based on several years of personal contact, were all the more valuable for the committee as well as for the faculty as a whole since Herr Dr. Einstein is an Israelite and since precisely to the Israelites among scholars are inscribed (in numerous cases not entirely without cause) all kinds of unpleasant peculiarities of character, such as intrusiveness, impudence, and a shopkeeper’s mentality in the perception of their academic position. It should be said, however, that also among the Israelites there exist men who do not exhibit a trace of these disagreeable qualities and that it is not proper, therefore, to disqualify a man only because he happens to be a Jew. Indeed, one occasionally finds people also among non-Jewish scholars who in regard to a commercial perception and utilization of their academic profession develop qualities that are usually considered as specifically Jewish. Therefore, neither the committee nor the faculty as a whole considered it compatible with its dignity to adopt anti-Semitism as a matter of policy.<sup><a id="filepos453130"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694281">37</a></sup>

<p>
不论是对于委员会还是所有教员，我们的同事克莱纳基于数年私人接触所做的表述都颇具价值，因为爱因斯坦博士是一个犹太人，而学者们有一种根深蒂固的看法认为，犹太人有各种令人不快的性格特征，比如胡搅蛮缠、莽撞无礼、如店老板一般对自己的学术职位精打细算和谋取私利等，在许多情况下确实如此。但另一方面，或许有些犹太人的品性并没有那么糟糕。因此，仅仅因为一个人是犹太人就剥夺他的资格并不妥当。事实上，我们偶尔也能发现一些非犹太学者，在用他们的学术职位牟利方面表现出了通常被认为是犹太人的典型特征。因此，无论是委员会还是所有教员都认为，把反犹主义当作考核标准与其尊严并不相符。

<a id="filepos453242"></a>The secret faculty vote in late March 1909 was ten in favor and one abstention. Einstein was offered his first professorship, four years after he had revolutionized physics. Unfortunately, his proposed salary was less than what he was making at the patent office, so he declined. Finally, the Zurich authorities raised their offer, and Einstein accepted. “So, now I too am an official member of the guild of whores,” he exulted to a colleague.<sup><a id="filepos453709"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694450">38</a></sup>

秘密投票于1909年3月底进行，结果是十票赞成，一票弃权。在使物理学发生革命5年之后，爱因斯坦终于第一次升任教授。不幸的是，他的薪水要低于专利局，所以他拒绝了。最后，苏黎世主管部门提高了薪水，爱因斯坦接受了，随即从专利局辞职。“现在，我也成了出卖才能者行会的一名正式成员了。”他对一位同事兴高采烈地说。

One person who saw a newspaper notice about Einstein’s appointment was a Basel housewife named Anna Meyer-Schmid. Ten years earlier, when she was an unmarried girl of 17, they had met during one of Einstein’s vacations with his mother at the Hotel Paradies. Most of the guests had seemed to him “philistines,” but he took a liking to Anna and even wrote a poem in her album: “What should I inscribe for you here? / I could think of many things / Including a kiss / On your tiny little mouth / If you’re angry about it / Do not start to cry / The best punishment / Is to give me one too.” He signed it, “Your rascally friend.”<sup><a id="filepos454492"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694608">39</a></sup>

爱因斯坦被任命的消息上了报纸。这则消息被一名女士看到了，她叫安娜·迈尔-施密特，是巴塞尔的一个家庭主妇。十年前，当她还是一个17岁的小女孩时，她曾与爱因斯坦见过面，那时爱因斯坦和妈妈正在天堂旅馆（Hotel Paradies）度假。在爱因斯坦眼里，大多数客人都显得那么俗气和缺乏教养，但他却对安娜另眼相看。他甚至还在她的签名簿上题了一首小诗：“我给你题写什么好/我会想起许多事情/其中也有/在可爱的小嘴上亲一亲/若你因此而生气/可不要马上就哭闹/最好的惩罚是——/还给我一个亲吻。”署名是“你调皮捣蛋的朋友”。

<div class="layout">

In response to a congratulatory postcard from her, Einstein replied with a polite and mildly suggestive letter. “I probably cherish the memory of the lovely weeks that I was allowed to spend near you in the Paradies more than you do,” he wrote. “So now I’ve become such a big schoolmaster that my name is even mentioned in the newspapers. But I have remained a simple fellow.” He noted that he had married his college friend Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, but he gave her his office address. “If you ever happen to be in Zurich and have time, look me up there; it would give me great pleasure.”<sup><a id="filepos455247"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694796">40</a></sup>
</p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
安娜寄给爱因斯坦一张明信片表示祝贺，爱因斯坦做了礼节性的但又稍具暗示的回复。“在天堂旅馆，我在您身边度过了几个星期美好的时光，对这段时间我所珍藏的记忆甚至可能比您还多，”他写道，“是的，我现在已经成了一个出名的教书匠了，甚至报纸都会提到我的名字。不过我仍然是个单纯的家伙。”他说他已经娶了大学时的朋友米列娃，但他给了安娜他的办公地址。“如果您碰巧来苏黎世并且有时间，请到那里来看我，我会非常高兴。”

</div></div>



<div class="layout">

Whether or not Einstein intended his response to hover uncertainly between innocence and suggestiveness, Anna’s eyes apparently snapped it into the latter position. She wrote a letter back, which Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> intercepted. Her jealousy aroused, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> then wrote a letter to Anna’s husband claiming (wishfully more than truthfully) that Einstein was outraged by Anna’s “inappropriate letter” and brazen attempt to rekindle a relationship.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
不论爱因斯坦写这封回复希望表达的是天真还是暗示，安娜显然做了后一种理解。她写了一封回信，但被米列娃截获了。米列娃醋意大发，随即给安娜的丈夫写了封信，声称（更多是盼望而非真实）爱因斯坦对安娜“不妥的书信”和企图明目张胆地重新激起一种暧昧关系大为光火。

Einstein ended up having to calm matters with an apology to the husband. “I am very sorry if I have caused you distress by my careless behavior,” he wrote. “I answered the congratulatory card your wife sent <a id="filepos456165"></a>me on the occasion of my appointment too heartily and thereby re-awakened the old affection we had for each other. But this was not done with impure intentions. The behavior of your wife, for whom I have the greatest respect, was totally honorable. It was wrong of my wife—and excusable only on account of extreme jealousy—to behave—without my knowledge—the way she did.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦最后不得不给安娜的丈夫写了封信来息事宁人。“非常抱歉，由于我做事大大咧咧，给您带来了痛苦，”他写道，“您的夫人在我获得任命之际给我寄来了贺卡，而我的回信用词过分亲密了，从而唤起了我们之间的旧情。不过，我的信并未掺杂任何非分之想。我对您的夫人极为尊敬，她的行为是非常得体的。错的是我的妻子，她的这种做法只是出于极端的嫉妒，这也情有可原，但她这样做我并不知晓。”

Although the incident itself was of no consequence, it marked a turn in Einstein’s relationship with Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. In his eyes, her brooding jealousy was making her darker. Decades later, still rankling at Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>’s behavior, he wrote to Anna’s daughter asserting, with a brutal bluntness, that his wife’s jealousy had been a pathological flaw typical of a woman of such “uncommon ugliness.”<sup><a id="filepos457131"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1694961">41</a></sup>

<p>
虽然这场风波就此平息，但它标志着爱因斯坦与米列娃关系的一个转折。在爱因斯坦看来，那股浓浓的嫉妒之情正在使米列娃变得愈发阴郁。数十年之后，他仍然对米列娃的行为心怀怨恨，他给安娜的女儿写信，恶狠狠地说，他妻子的嫉妒是一个“丑八婆”所特有的病态缺陷。

Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> indeed had a jealous streak. She resented not only her husband’s flirtations with other women but also the time he spent with male colleagues. Now that he had become a professor, she succumbed to a professional envy that was understandable given her own curtailed scientific career. “With that kind of fame, he does not have much time left for his wife,” she told her friend Helene Savi<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>. “You wrote that I must be jealous of science. But what can you do? One gets the pearl, the other the box.”

</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>



米列娃的确有点嫉妒。她不仅怨恨丈夫与其他女人调情，而且对他与男同事们长时间在一起也心存不满。现在爱因斯坦已俨然成为教授，她产生了一种职业上的妒羨。由于她本人的科学事业于中途受挫，这是可以理解的。“他如今声名大噪，已经没有多少时间陪伴妻子了，”她对朋友萨维奇说，“你写道，我一定很妒羨科学。但你能怎么做呢？一个人得到了珍珠，另一个人只得到了珍珠匣子。”

<div class="layout">

In particular, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> worried that her husband’s fame would make him colder and more self-centered. “I am very happy for his success, because he really does deserve it,” she wrote in another letter. “I only hope that fame does not exert a detrimental influence on his human side.”<sup><a id="filepos458249"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1695292">42</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

米列娃尤其担心丈夫的名气会使他变得更加冷漠和自我。“对于他的成功，我很高兴，因为这是他实际应得的，”她在另一封信中说，“我只希望，名气不会损害他人性的一面。”

In one sense, Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>’s worries proved unwarranted. Even as his fame increased exponentially, Einstein would retain a personal simplicity, an unaffected style, and at least a veneer of genial humility. But viewed from a different reference frame, there were transformations to his human side. Sometime around 1909, he began drifting apart from his wife. His resistance to chains and bonds increasingly led him to escape into his work while taking a detached approach to the realm he dismissed as “the merely personal.”

<p>
从某种意义上说，米列娃的顾虑是没有根据的。甚至在名望与日俱增之时，爱因斯坦也一直保持着朴素的人格和自然真挚的性情，至少在外表上是温和谦恭的。但是从另一个参照系来看，他的人性一面的确有所转变。1909年前后，他开始疏远妻子。对约束和牵绊的抗拒越来越使他躲进自己的工作中，而对他所谓的“纯个人”领域则采取一种漠然置之的态度。

On one of his last days working at the patent office, he received a large envelope with an elegant sheet covered in what seemed to be Latin calligraphy. Because it seemed odd and impersonal, he threw it <a id="filepos459181"></a>in the wastebasket. It was, in fact, an invitation to be one of those receiving an honorary doctorate at the July 1909 commemoration of the founding of Geneva’s university, and authorities there finally got a friend of Einstein to persuade him to attend. Einstein brought only a straw hat and an informal suit, so he stood out rather strangely, both in the parade and at the opulent formal dinner that night. Amused by the whole situation, he turned to the patrician seated next to him and speculated about the austere Protestant Reformation leader who had founded the university: “Do you know what Calvin would have done had he been here?” The gentleman, befuddled, said no. Einstein replied, “He would have erected an enormous stake and had us all burnt for our sinful extravagance.” As Einstein later recalled,“The man never addressed another word to me.”<sup><a id="filepos460093"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1695610">43</a></sup>

Also at the end of the summer of 1909, Einstein was invited to address the annual <em>Naturforscher</em> conference, the preeminent meeting of German-speaking scientists, which was held that year in Salzburg. Organizers had put both relativity and the quantum nature of light on the agenda, and they expected him to speak on the former. Instead, Einstein decided that he preferred to emphasize what he considered the more pressing issue: how to interpret quantum theory and reconcile it with the wave theory of light that Maxwell had so elegantly formulated.

同样是在1909年夏末，爱因斯坦应邀出席在萨尔茨堡召开的自然研究者（Naturfosche）年会，这是德语区科学家最重要的会议。会议组织者将相对论和光的量子性都列入了议程，他们本来期望爱因斯坦能够就相对论发表看法。但爱因斯坦却认为另一个问题更迫切，即如何解释量子，并把它与麦克斯韦所表述的优雅的光的波动理论相协调。

After his “happiest thought” at the end of 1907 about how the equivalence of gravity and acceleration might lead to a generalization of relativity theory, Einstein had put that subject aside to focus instead on what he called “the radiation problem” (i.e., quantum theory). The more he thought about his “heuristic” notion that light was made up of quanta, or indivisible packets, the more he worried that he and Planck had wrought a revolution that would destroy the classical foundations of physics, especially Maxwell’s equations. “I have come to this pessimistic view mainly as a result of endless, vain efforts to interpret . . . Planck’s constant in an intuitive way,” he wrote a fellow physicist early in 1908. “I even seriously doubt that it will be possible to maintain the <a id="filepos461793"></a>general validity of Maxwell’s equations.”<sup><a id="filepos461858"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1695779">44</a></sup> (As it turned out, his love of Maxwell’s equations was well placed.

1907年年底，爱因斯坦产生了“最幸福的思想”，即通过引力与加速的等效来推广相对论。此后，他将这一问题搁置起来，转而研究他所谓的“辐射问题即量子理论”。他越是思考那种“启发式的”思想，即光由量子构成，或由不可见的能量包构成，就越是担心他和普朗克已经发动了一场摧毁整个经典物理学基础（特别是麦克斯韦方程）的革命。“我之所以得出这个悲观的看法，主要是因为用一种直观的方法来解释……普朗克常量的各种努力是没有止境的和徒劳无益的，”他1908年年初给一位物理学同事写信说，“我甚至极为怀疑，坚持麦克斯韦方程的普遍有效性是否可能。” 后来的事实表明，他并没有错爱麦克斯韦方程。麦克斯韦方程属于极少数没有被爱因斯坦直接创立的相对论和间接发动的量子革命所改变的理论物理学要素。

When Einstein, still not officially a professor, arrived at the Salzburg conference in September 1909, he finally met Max Planck and other giants that he had known only through letters. On the afternoon of the third day, he stepped in front of more than a hundred famed scientists and delivered a speech that Wolfgang Pauli, who was to become a pioneer of quantum mechanics, later pronounced “one of the landmarks in the development of theoretical physics.”

那时爱因斯坦仍然没有正式升任教授。当他1909年9月出席萨尔茨堡会议时，他终于见到了普朗克以及其他仅有书信来往的巨头们。第三天下午，他当着上百位著名科学家的面发表了讲演，量子力学的先驱沃尔夫冈·泡利后来称这是“理论物理学发展史上的一座里程碑”。

Einstein began by explaining how the wave theory of light was no longer complete. Light (or any radiation) could also be regarded, he said, as a beam of particles or packets of energy, which he said was akin to what Newton had posited. “Light has certain basic properties that can be understood more readily from the standpoint of the Newtonian emission theory than from the standpoint of the wave theory,” he declared. “I thus believe that the next phase of theoretical physics will bring us a theory of light that can be interpreted as a kind of fusion of the wave and of the emission theories of light.”

爱因斯坦一开场就解释了光的波动说如何不再完备。他说，与牛顿的假设类似，光（或辐射）也可以被看成一束能量粒子或能量包。“光具有某些基本属性，要解释这些属性，牛顿的光的发射论观点要比光的波动说好得多，”他宣称，“因此我认为，理论物理学的下一个发展阶段将给我们带来这样一种光学理论，它可以认为是光的波动说和发射论的某种融合。”

Combining particle theory with wave theory, he warned, would bring “a profound change.” This was not a good thing, he feared. It could undermine the certainties and determinism inherent in classical physics.

For a moment, Einstein mused that perhaps such a fate could be avoided by accepting Planck’s more limited interpretation of quanta: that they were features only of how radiation was emitted and absorbed by a surface rather than a feature of the actual light wave as it propagated through space. “Would it not be possible,” he asked, “to retain at least the equations for the propagation of radiation and conceive only the processes of emission and absorption differently?” But after comparing the behavior of light to the behavior of gas molecules, as he had done in his 1905 light quanta paper, Einstein concluded that, alas, this was not possible.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦曾一度认为，如果接受普朗克对量子的更为狭义的诠释，那么这样一种命运或许可以避免。普朗克认为，量子只是关于辐射如何被发射和被表面吸收的特征，而不是关于实际的光波在空间传播的特征。他问：“至少保留关于辐射传播的方程，而只对发射和吸收的过程做不同理解，这是否可能呢？”但在将光的行为与气体分子的行为进行比较之后（就像他在1905年光量子论文中所做的那样），爱因斯坦不得不下结论说，这是不可能的。

As a result, Einstein said, light must be regarded as behaving like both an undulating wave and a stream of particles. “These two <a id="filepos464544"></a>structural properties simultaneously displayed by radiation,” he declared at the end of his talk, “should not be considered as mutually incompatible.”<sup><a id="filepos464724"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1696047">45</a></sup>

It was the first well-conceived promulgation of the wave-particle duality of light, and it had implications as profound as Einstein’s earlier theoretical breakthroughs. “Is it possible to combine energy quanta and the wave principles of radiation?” he merrily wrote to a physicist friend. “Appearances are against it, but the Almighty—it seems—managed the trick.”<sup><a id="filepos465233"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1696447">46</a></sup>

就这样，经过深思熟虑，爱因斯坦第一次宣布了光的波粒二象性，这与他早年的理论突破具有同样深刻的内涵。“有可能将能量子与辐射的波动原理结合起来吗？”他愉快地给一个物理学家朋友写信说，“现象与此不合，但万能的上帝（似乎）自有办法。”

A vibrant discussion followed Einstein’s speech, led by Planck himself. Still unwilling to embrace the physical reality underlying the mathematical constant that he had devised nine years earlier, or to accept the revolutionary ramifications envisioned by Einstein, Planck now played protector of the old order. He admitted that radiation involved discrete “quanta, which are to be conceived as atoms of action.” But he insisted that these quanta existed <em>only</em> as part of the process of radiation being emitted or absorbed. “The question is where to look for these quanta,” he said. “According to Mr. Einstein, it would be necessary to conceive that free radiation in a vacuum, and thus the light waves themselves consist of atomistic quanta, and hence force us to give up Maxwell’s equations. This seems to me a step that is not yet necessary.”<sup><a id="filepos466238"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1696997">47</a></sup>

爱因斯坦的演讲结束后，普朗克亲自主持了讨论，气氛十分热烈。普朗克仍然不愿接受隐藏在他九年前发明的数学常量背后的物理实在，也不愿接受爱因斯坦所预想的革命性结论，他现在成了旧秩序的维护者。他承认，辐射包含着离散的“量子，它被认为是作用的原子”。但他认为这些量子只是作为辐射被发射或吸收过程的一部分而存在。“现在的问题是到哪里去寻找这些量子，”他说，“根据爱因斯坦先生的说法，必须设想真空中的自由辐射，也即光波本身是由原子般的量子构成的，从而迫使我们放弃麦克斯韦方程。在我看来，这一步似乎还没有必要。”

Within two decades, Einstein would assume a similar role as protector of the old order. Indeed, he was already looking for ways out of the eerie dilemmas raised by quantum theory. “I am very hopeful that I will solve the radiation problem, and that I will do so without light quanta,” he wrote a young physicist he was working with.<sup><a id="filepos466686"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697187">48</a></sup>

不出20年，爱因斯坦也会扮演类似的角色去维护旧的秩序。事实上，他已经在想方设法解决由量子理论所引发的奇特难题了。“我非常希望我能解决辐射问题，我将在不假设光量子的情况下做这件事。”他给一位共事的年轻物理学家写信说。

It was all too mystifying, at least for the time being. So as he moved up the professorial ranks in the German-speaking universities of Europe, he turned his attention back to the topic that was uniquely his own, relativity, and for a while became a refugee from the wonderland of the quanta. As he lamented to a friend, “The more successes the quantum theory enjoys, the sillier it looks.”<sup><a id="filepos467192"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1697352">49</a></sup>

至少在当时，这实在太神秘了。随着他升任欧洲德语区大学的教授，他又把注意力转回到相对论这一专属于他的主题，从而暂时逃离量子奇境。他曾向一位朋友悲叹道：“量子理论越是成功，就越显得愚蠢。”
