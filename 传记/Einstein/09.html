<p>He was slow in learning how to talk. “My parents were so worried,” he later recalled, “that they consulted a doctor.” Even after he had begun using words, sometime after the age of 2, he developed a quirk that prompted the family maid to dub him “der Depperte,” the dopey one, and others in his family to label him as “almost backwards.” Whenever he had something to say, he would try it out on himself, whispering it softly until it sounded good enough to pronounce aloud. “Every sentence he uttered,” his worshipful younger sister recalled, “no matter how routine, he repeated to himself softly, moving his lips.” It was all very worrying, she said. “He had such difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never learn.”<sup><a id="filepos53292"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1588346">1</a></sup>

爱因斯坦学习说话很晚。他后来回忆说：“当时我的父母很发愁，还去找了医生。”两岁多时，他好不容易能说出些单词了，却又染上了一个怪毛病，就因为这个，家里的女仆甚至给他起了个“笨瓜”（（derDepperte）的绰号，家里人则说他“发育比较迟缓”。原来，他想说话的时候，总要先轻声地讲给自己听，直到差不多了才会大声说出来。他的妹妹后来回忆说：“他说出每一句话，不论多么平常，都要嚅动着嘴唇，喃喃地自言自语。”这的确令人担忧，“他学习语言相当吃力，身边的人担心他永远都学不会。”

<p>His slow development was combined with a cheeky rebelliousness <a id="filepos53453"></a>toward authority, which led one schoolmaster to send him packing and another to amuse history by declaring that he would never amount to much.

他不仅发育迟缓，而且还顶撞老师，不服从权威，以致有老师曾让他收拾东西走人，还有一位老师则断言他永远都不会有出息。今天看来，这不禁令人莞尔。这些性格特点不仅使爱因斯坦成为世界上调皮贪玩学生的守护神，而且也成就了这位现时代最具创造力的科学天才。

<p>His cocky contempt for authority led him to question received wisdom in ways that well-trained acolytes in the academy never contemplated. And as for his slow verbal development, he came to believe that it allowed him to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for granted. “When I ask myself how it happened that I in particular discovered the relativity theory, it seemed to lie in the following circumstance,” Einstein once explained. “The ordinary adult never bothers his head about the problems of space and time. These are things he has thought of as a child. But I developed so slowly that I began to wonder about space and time only when I was already grown up. Consequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary child would have.”<sup><a id="filepos54712"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1588872">3</a></sup>

他对权威的蔑视使他很容易对一般人的看法提出质疑，而在那些训练有素的学院派看来，他所做的许多质疑简直就是痴人说梦。至于语言发育迟缓，他认为这使他可以带着好奇去观察被认为是理所当然的日常现象。“我也问过自己，为什么偏偏是我发现了相对论，我以为事情大概是这样的，”爱因斯坦曾经这样解释道，“一般成年人从不为时间和空间问题操心，他们认为只有小孩子才会想这些事情。但我发育非常迟缓，直到长大之后才开始对时间和空间感到好奇。所以我对这个问题的思考要比别的孩子深入一些。”

<p>Einstein’s developmental problems have probably been exaggerated, perhaps even by himself, for we have some letters from his adoring grandparents saying that he was just as clever and endearing as every grandchild is. But throughout his life, Einstein had a mild form of echolalia, causing him to repeat phrases to himself, two or three times, especially if they amused him. And he generally preferred to think in pictures, most notably in famous thought experiments, such as imagining watching lightning strikes from a moving train or experiencing gravity while inside a falling elevator. “I very rarely think in words at all,” he later told a psychologist. “A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words afterwards.”<sup><a id="filepos55571"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1589057">4</a></sup>

爱因斯坦的发育问题也许被夸大了，甚至他本人都可能有所夸张，因为他的祖父母曾经写信说，他和所有孩子一样聪明可爱。但爱因斯坦终生都有轻度的言语模仿症，他经常会把句子自言自语地重复两三遍，特别是当他觉得这个句子有意思时。他一般倾向于以图像的方式进行思考，最典型的莫过于那些著名的思想实验，比如想象从火车上发出的闪光，或者在下降的升降机中体验引力。“我很少用语词进行思考，”他后来对一位心理学家说，“只有在想法产生之后，我才可能试着用语词来表达它。”

<p>Einstein was descended, on both parents’ sides, from Jewish trades-men and peddlers who had, for at least two centuries, made modest livings in the rural villages of Swabia in southwestern Germany. With each generation they had become, or at least so they thought, increasingly assimilated into the German culture that they loved. Although Jewish by cultural designation and kindred instinct, they displayed scant interest in the religion or its rituals.

爱因斯坦祖上均为犹太商贩。200多年来，他们一直在德国西南部的施瓦本乡村过着深居简出的生活。随着时光的流逝，他们越来越多地融入了自己更为欣赏的德国文化，至少他们是这样认为的。虽然从文化血统上来说仍然是犹太人，但他们对犹太教及其宗教仪式并不很感兴趣。

<p>Einstein regularly dismissed the role that his heritage played in <a id="filepos56252"></a>shaping who he became. “Exploration of my ancestors,” he told a friend late in life, “leads nowhere.”<sup><a id="filepos56389"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1589252">5</a></sup> That’s not fully true. He was blessed by being born into an independent-minded and intelligent family line that valued education, and his life was certainly affected, in ways both beautiful and tragic, by membership in a religious heritage that had a distinctive intellectual tradition and a history of being both outsiders and wanderers. Of course, the fact that he happened to be Jewish in Germany in the early twentieth century made him more of an outsider, and more of a wanderer, than he would have preferred—but that, too, became integral to who he was and the role he would play in world history.

爱因斯坦曾多次否认传统对他的前途产生过影响。他晚年对一个朋友说：“研究我的祖上没有什么用处。”这样说并非完全正确。他出生在一个思想开明的重视教育的家庭，这是他的幸运。犹太教有着独特的思想传统，它的历史可以说是由局外人和流浪者写成的，这一切对他的生活当然会有影响，尽管影响的方式可能有好有坏。当然，他碰巧出生在20世纪初的德国，从而更是一个局外人和流浪者，这也许有违他愿，但这一切都决定了他的身份以及在世界历史上将要扮演的角色。

<p>Einstein’s father, Hermann, was born in 1847 in the Swabian village of Buchau, whose thriving Jewish community was just beginning to enjoy the right to practice any vocation. Hermann showed “a marked inclination for mathematics,”<sup><a id="filepos57355"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1589563">6</a></sup> and his family was able to send him seventy-five miles north to Stuttgart for high school.

1847年，爱因斯坦的父亲赫尔曼出生在施瓦本地区的布豪（Buchau）村。当时，那里的犹太团体正日趋兴盛，他们刚刚开始享有自由从事职业的权利。赫尔曼显示出了“对数学的强烈爱好”，家里把他送到了75英里以北的斯图加特去读中学，但却无法送他上大学，因为多数大学都不接纳犹太人，于是他不得不回家做起了生意。

<p>In 1880, just a year after Albert’s birth, Hermann’s featherbed business foundered and he was persuaded to move to Munich by his brother Jakob, who had opened a gas and electrical supply company there. Jakob, the youngest of five siblings, had been able to get a higher education, unlike Hermann, and he had qualified as an engineer. As they competed for contracts to provide generators and electrical lighting to municipalities in southern Germany, Jakob was in charge of the technical side while Hermann provided a modicum of salesmanship skills plus, perhaps more important, loans from his wife’s side of the family.<sup><a id="filepos60586"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1590431">11</a></sup>

<p>The Einsteins settled into a comfortable home with mature trees and an elegant garden in a Munich suburb for what was to be, at least through most of Albert’s childhood, a respectable bourgeois existence.

In 1882, just after the Einsteins arrived, the city had about 300,000 residents, 85 percent of them Catholics and 2 percent of them Jewish, and it was the host of the first German electricity exhibition, at which electric lights were introduced to the city streets.

<p>Einstein’s back garden was often bustling with cousins and children. But he shied from their boisterous games and instead “occupied himself with quieter things.” One governess nicknamed him “Father Bore.” He was generally a loner, a tendency he claimed to cherish throughout his life, although his was a special sort of detachment that was interwoven with a relish for camaraderie and intellectual companionship. “From the very beginning he was inclined to separate himself from children his own age and to engage in daydreaming and meditative musing,” according to Philipp Frank, a longtime scientific colleague.<sup><a id="filepos62851"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1590796">13</a></sup>

<p>After being mesmerized by the compass needle’s fealty to an unseen field, Einstein would develop a lifelong devotion to field theories as a way to describe nature. Field theories use mathematical quantities, such as numbers or vectors or tensors, to describe how the conditions at any point in space will affect matter or another field. For example, in a gravitational or an electromagnetic field there are forces that could act on a particle at any point, and the equations of a field theory describe how these change as one moves through the region. The first paragraph of his great 1905 paper on special relativity begins with a consideration of the effects of electrical and magnetic fields; his theory of general relativity is based on equations that describe a gravitational field; and at the very end of his life he was doggedly scribbling further field equations in the hope that they would form the basis for a theory of everything. As the science historian Gerald Holton has noted, Einstein <a id="filepos67415"></a>regarded “the classical concept of the field the greatest contribution to the scientific spirit.”<sup><a id="filepos67536"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1593297">18</a></sup>

罗盘上的小磁针竟然听任一种看不见的场摆布，这使爱因斯坦百思不得其解。后来，爱因斯坦终生都致力于用场论来描述自然。场论用数、矢量、张量等数学量来描述空间中任一点的条件如何影响物质或其他场。例如，在引力场或电磁场中，处于任一点的粒子都可以受到力的作用。场论方程描述的是这些力如何随位置的改变而改变。1905年，他写下了那篇关于狭义相对论的伟大论文，它一上来谈的就是电磁场效应：而广义相对论的基础也是描述引力场的方程：到了晚年，他仍然对场方程孜孜以求，试图在此基础上建立一种万有理论。正如科学史家霍尔顿所指出的，爱因斯坦认为：“经典的场概念是对科学精神的最大贡献。”

Nevertheless, it did show Einstein’s youthful appreciation that elegant theorems can be derived from simple axioms—and the fact that he was in little danger of failing math. “As a boy of 12, I was thrilled to see that it was possible to find out truth by reasoning alone, without the help of any outside experience,” he told a reporter from a high <a id="filepos78963"></a>school newspaper in Princeton years later. “I became more and more convinced that nature could be understood as a relatively simple mathematical structure.”<sup><a id="filepos79143"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1597034">33</a></sup>

Likewise, because of the speed of the earth through space, the same must be true of light going through a telescope. What was amazing, said Bernstein, was that experiments showed the same effect no matter how fast the source of the light was moving. In a sentence that, because of its relation to what Einstein would later famously conclude, seems to have made an impression, Bernstein declared, “Since each kind of light proves to be of exactly the same <a id="filepos81770"></a>speed, the law of the speed of light can well be called the most general of all of nature’s laws.”

和后来的爱因斯坦一样，伯恩斯坦也渴望将自然界中所有的力都统一在一起。例如，他先是讨论了光等电磁现象如何可能被看作波，然后猜想引力或许也是如此。伯恩斯坦写道，我们的知觉所运用的一切概念背后都潜藏着一种统一性和简单性。科学真理在于发现理论来描述这种背后的实在。对于年少的爱因斯坦来说，这种观点无异于一种启示，帮助他建立起一种实在论的态度，他后来回忆说：“在我们之外有一个巨大的世界，它独立于我们人类而存在，在我们面前就像一个伟大而永恒的谜。”

<p>Talmud also helped Einstein continue to explore the wonders of mathematics by giving him a textbook on geometry two years before he was scheduled to learn that subject in school. Later, Einstein would refer to it as “the sacred little geometry book” and speak of it with awe: “Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which—though by no means evident—could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me.” Years later, in a lecture at Oxford, Einstein noted, “If Euclid failed to kindle your youthful enthusiasm, then you were not born to be a scientific thinker.”<sup><a id="filepos84519"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1598819">39</a></sup>

塔尔梅还送给爱因斯坦一本几何学教科书，帮助他在正式学习之前继续探索数学的奇迹。后来，爱因斯坦称之为“神圣的几何学小书”，谈起它时总是饱含敬畏：“这本书里有许多断言，比如三角形的三条高交于一点，它们本身并不是显而易见的，但却可以很可靠地加以证明，以至于任何怀疑似乎都不可能。”又过了些年，在牛津大学的一次讲演中，爱因斯坦指出：“如果欧几里得未能激起你少年时代的热情，那么你天生注定不是一个科学思想家。”

<p>So the awed medical student moved on to introducing Einstein to philosophy. “I recommended Kant to him,” he recalled. “At that time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant’s works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.” Kant became, for a while, Einstein’s favorite philosopher, and his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> eventually led him to delve also into David Hume, Ernst Mach, and the issue of what can be known about reality.

<p>Einstein’s exposure to science produced a sudden reaction against religion at age 12, just as he would have been readying for a bar mitzvah. Bernstein, in his popular science volumes, had reconciled science with religious inclination.

12岁那年，爱因斯坦很快就要行犹太受戒礼。由于接触到了科学、数学和哲学，他突然开始对宗教持反对态度。伯恩斯坦在其通俗科学著作中，已经将科学与宗教倾向达成了和解。正如他所说：“宗教倾向潜藏于人的一种模糊意识当中，认为包括人在内的整个世界绝非一场偶然的游戏，而是受规律支配的产物。万事万物都有一个根本的理由。”

<p>Einstein would later come close to these sentiments. But at the time, his leap away from faith was a radical one. “Through the reading of popular scientific books, I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression.”<sup><a id="filepos86759"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1599344">41</a></sup>

爱因斯坦很久以后才会认同这种情感。但在当时，他毅然决然地从信仰中脱离出来。“由于阅读了通俗的科学书籍，我很快就深信不疑，《圣经》里有许多故事不可能是真实的。其结果就是一种真正狂热的自由思想，并且交织着这样一种印象：国家是故意用谎言来欺骗年轻人的。这种印象产生了决定性的后果。”

<p>As a result, Einstein avoided religious rituals for the rest of his life. “There arose in Einstein an aversion to the orthodox practice of the Jewish or any traditional religion, as well as to attendance at religious services, and this he has never lost,” his friend Philipp Frank later noted.

During most of Einstein’s school years, the Einstein brothers’ company had been a success. In 1885, it had two hundred employees and provided the first electrical lights for Munich’s Oktoberfest.

Jakob Einstein received six patents for improvements in arc lamps, automatic circuit breakers, and electric meters. The company was poised to rival Siemens and other power companies then flourishing.

<p>That summer, at age 16, he wrote his first essay on theoretical physics, which he titled “On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field.” The topic was important, for the notion of the ether would play a critical role in Einstein’s career. At the time, scientists conceived of light simply as a wave, and so they assumed that the universe must contain an all-pervasive yet unseen substance that was doing the rippling and thus propagating the waves, just as water was the medium rippling up and down and thus propagating the waves in an ocean. They dubbed this the ether, and Einstein (at least for the time being) went along with the assumption.

这篇论文由14个段落组成，它重复了维奥勒教科书上的一些观点，论述了科普杂志上关于海因里希·赫兹最近的电磁波发现的一些报道。爱因斯坦在文中给出了实验建议，以解释“电流四周形成的磁场”。他说这将很有趣，“因为探究以太在这种情况下的弹性状态，我们就可以瞥见电流的神秘性质”。

<p>It was a perfect school for Einstein. The teaching was based on the philosophy of a Swiss educational reformer of the early nineteenth century, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, who believed in encouraging students to visualize images. He also thought it important to nurture the “inner dignity” and individuality of each child. Students should be allowed to reach their own conclusions, Pestalozzi preached, by using a series of steps that began with hands-on observations and then proceeded to intuitions, conceptual thinking, and visual imagery.<sup><a id="filepos101916"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1602836">56</a></sup> It was even possible to learn—and truly understand—the laws of math and physics that way.

对于爱因斯坦来说，这所学校堪称完美。这里的教学所遵循的乃是19世纪瑞士教育改革家约翰·海因里希·裴斯泰洛齐的哲学，他强调激励学生的形象思维，重视培养每一个孩子的“内心尊严”和个性。裴斯泰洛齐主张，应当让学生们一步步得出自己的结论，即从亲身观察开始，逐渐过渡到直觉、概念思维和视觉意象。甚至可以用这样的方法来学习——并且真正理解——数学和物理学定律！机械的练习背诵和填鸭式的教学都应当避免。

<p>Einstein loved Aarau. “Pupils were treated individually,” his sister recalled, “more emphasis was placed on independent thought than on punditry, and young people saw the teacher not as a figure of authority, but, alongside the student, a man of distinct personality.” It was the opposite of the German education that Einstein had hated. “When compared to six years’ schooling at a German authoritarian gymnasium,” Einstein later said, “it made me clearly realize how much superior an education based on free action and personal responsibility is to one relying on outward authority.”<sup><a id="filepos102821"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1603070">57</a></sup>

爱因斯坦很喜欢阿劳中学。“学生是个别对待的，”他的妹妹回忆说，“独立的思考比迂腐的博学更受重视，年轻人不是把教师当成权威人物，而是看作与学生一样的有独特个性的人。”这与爱因斯坦所憎恶的德国教育完全相反。“通过与德国中学六年的独裁主义教育相对比，”爱因斯坦后来说，“我清楚地认识到，强调自由行动和个体责任感的教育是多么优越于崇尚外在权威的教育。

<p>The visual understanding of concepts, as stressed by Pestalozzi and his followers in Aarau, became a significant aspect of Einstein’s genius. “Visual understanding is the essential and only true means of teaching how to judge things correctly,” Pestalozzi wrote, and “the learning of numbers and language must be definitely subordinated.”<sup><a id="filepos103293"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1603226">58</a></sup>

<p>Not surprisingly, it was at this school that Einstein first engaged in the visualized thought experiment that would help make him the greatest scientific genius of his time: he tried to picture what it would be like to ride alongside a light beam. “In Aarau I made my first rather childish experiments in thinking that had a direct bearing on the Special Theory,” he later told a friend. “If a person could run after a light wave with the same speed as light, you would have a wave arrangement which could be completely independent of time.

毫不奇怪，正是在这所学校，爱因斯坦才开始专心思考那个帮助他成为伟大天才的思想实验：他试图设想，追着一束光跑会出现什么情况。“在阿劳，我做了第一批非常幼稚的思想实验，它们对狭义相对论产生了直接影响，”他后来对一位朋友说，“如果一个人能够以光速追赶一束光，那么他所看到的波的排列就会完全不随时间变化。这样的事情当然是不可能的。”

<p>This type of visualized thought experiments—<em>Gedankenexperiment</em><a id="filepos104177"></a>—became a hallmark of Einstein’s career.

<p>“Papa” Jost Winteler was a liberal who shared Einstein’s allergy to German militarism and to nationalism in general.

<p>More important, in the warm embrace of the Winteler family, Einstein became more secure and personable.

In the evenings he would sometimes study, “but more often he would sit with the family around the table.”<sup><a id="filepos106119"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1603761">60</a></sup>

更重要的是，在温特勒一家无微不至的关怀下，爱因斯坦变得更加无忧无虑和英俊潇洒。他仍然认为自己很不合群，但温特勒一家帮他催熟了情感，敞开了心扉。“他幽默感十足，不时开怀大笑。”女儿安娜回忆说，“他晚上经常在家用功，但更多的时候是同全家人围桌而坐侃侃而谈。”

<p>His renunciation of Judaism in 1896 should, therefore, be seen not as a clean break but as part of a lifelong evolution of his feelings about his cultural identity. “At that time I would not even have understood what leaving Judaism could possibly mean,” he wrote a friend the year before he died. “But I was fully aware of my Jewish origin, even though the full significance of belonging to Jewry was not realized by me until later.”<sup><a id="filepos114617"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1605733">69</a></sup>

因此，不应把他1896年对犹太教的放弃看成一种彻底决裂，而应看成其文化认同过程的一部分。“当时，我甚至不明白脱离犹太教可能意味着什么，”他在去世前一年给朋友写信说，“但我完全清楚自己的犹太血统，即使只有后来我才认识到属于犹太民族的重要意义。”

<p>Einstein ended his year at the Aarau school in a manner that would have seemed impressive for anyone except one of history’s great geniuses, scoring the second highest grades in his class. (Alas, the name of the boy who bested Einstein is lost to history.) On a 1 to 6 scale, with 6 being the highest, he scored a 5 or 6 in all of his science and math courses as well as in history and Italian. His lowest grade was a 3, in French.

爱因斯坦在阿劳中学的学习结束了，结果出乎所有人的预料：这位伟大天才的分数在班上名列第二。（可惜，那位胜过爱因斯坦的男孩的名字已经尘封于历史中。）他所有的科学和数学课程都得了5分（满分为6分），历史和意大利语也是5分，法语最低，是3分。

<p>That qualified him to take a series of exams, written and oral, that would permit him, if he passed, to enter the Zurich Polytechnic. On his German exam, he did a perfunctory outline of a Goethe play and scored a 5. In math, he made a careless mistake, calling a number “imaginary” when he meant “irrational,” but still got a top grade. In physics, he arrived late and left early, completing the two-hour test in an hour and fifteen minutes; he got the top grade. Altogether, he ended <a id="filepos115719"></a>up with a 5.5, the best grade among the nine students taking the exams.

就这样，他获得了笔试和口试的机会。如果考试通过，就可以进入苏黎世联邦工学院学习了。德语考试要求为歌德的一部戏剧写出内容提要，爱因斯坦轻松得了5分。在数学考试中，他不小心把“虚”数写成了“无理”数，不过还是得到了最高分。在物理学考试中，他交卷很早，一小时零一刻钟就做完了需要在两小时内完成的试题，同样也得到了最高分。最后，他总评为5.5分，在九个应试的学生中名列第一。

<p>In the summer of 1896, the Einstein brothers’ electrical business again failed, this time because they bungled getting the necessary water rights to build a hydroelectric system in Pavia. The partnership was dissolved in a friendly fashion, and Jakob joined a large firm as an engineer. But Hermann, whose optimism and pride tended to overwhelm any prudence, insisted on opening yet another new dynamo business, this time in Milan. Albert was so dubious of his father’s prospects that he went to his relatives and suggested that they not finance him again, but they did.<sup><a id="filepos117631"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1606110">71</a></sup>

1896年的夏天，爱因斯坦兄弟的公司破产了，因为在获得建造帕维亚的水电系统所需的用水权上，他们把事情弄糟了。兄弟俩互道珍重，然后分道扬镳。雅各布去了一家大公司当工程师，乐观自信的赫尔曼则执意在米兰做起了新的发电机买卖。阿尔伯特对父亲的前景并不看好，他登门造访各位亲戚，建议他们不要再资助父亲，但没有成功。

Thinking for its own sake, like music!”<sup><a id="filepos118164"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1606264">72</a></sup> And thus he headed off to the Zurich Polytechnic.
