<p>The ocean liner <em>Westmoreland,</em> which carried Einstein, at age 54, to what would become his new home country, arrived in New York Harbor on October 17, 1933. Waiting to meet him in the rain at the Twenty-third Street pier was an official committee led by his friend Samuel Untermyer, a prominent attorney, who carried some orchids he had grown, plus a group of cheerleaders that was scheduled to parade with him to a welcoming pageant.</p>

<p>Einstein and his entourage, however, were nowhere to be found. Abraham Flexner, the director of the Institute for Advanced Study, was obsessed with shielding him from publicity, whatever Einstein’s quirky preferences might be. So he had sent a tugboat, with two Institute trustees, to spirit Einstein away from the <em>Westmoreland</em> as soon as <a id="filepos1194187"></a>it cleared quarantine. “Make no statement and give no interviews on any subject,” he had cabled. To reiterate the message, he sent a letter with one of the trustees who greeted Einstein’s ship. “Your safety in America depends upon silence and refraining from attendance at public functions,” it said.<sup><a id="filepos1194529"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1885598">1</a></sup></p>

然而，爱因斯坦一行不知去向。高等研究院院长弗莱克斯纳竭尽所能让爱因斯坦不受公众注意，不论爱因斯坦可能有什么古怪的偏好。于是，他派研究院的两位董事会成员乘坐一艘拖船，等隔离一旦解除，就迅速把爱因斯坦从“威斯特摩兰”带走。“不要就任何主题发表声明或接受采访。”他发电报说。为了重申这一要求，他让一位迎接爱因斯坦的董事会成员带去了一封信。“你在美国的安全取决于你默不作声，不在公开场合露面。”信上说。

<p>Carrying his violin case, with a profusion of hair poking out from a wide-brimmed black hat, Einstein surreptitiously disembarked onto the tug, which then ferried him and his party to the Battery, where a car was waiting to whisk them to Princeton. “All Dr. Einstein wants is to be left in peace and quiet,” Flexner told reporters.<sup><a id="filepos1194975"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1885834">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Actually, he also wanted a newspaper and an ice cream cone. So as soon as he had checked into Princeton’s Peacock Inn, he changed into casual clothes and, smoking his pipe, went walking to a newsstand, where he bought an afternoon paper and chuckled over the headlines about the mystery of his whereabouts. Then he walked into an ice cream parlor, the Baltimore, pointed his thumb at the cone a young divinity student had just bought, and then pointed at himself. As the waitress made change for him, she announced, “This one goes in my memory book.”<sup><a id="filepos1195646"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1886085">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Einstein was given a corner office in a university hall that served as the temporary headquarters of the Institute. There were eighteen scholars in residence then, including the mathematicians Oswald Veblen (nephew of the social theorist Thorstein Veblen) and John von Neumann, a pioneer of computer theory. When shown his office, he was asked what equipment he might need. “A desk or table, a chair, paper and pencils,” he replied. “Oh yes, and a large wastebasket, so I can throw away all my mistakes.”<sup><a id="filepos1196277"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1886392">4</a></sup></p>

<p>He and Elsa soon found a house to rent, which they celebrated by hosting a small musical recital featuring the works of Haydn and Mozart. The noted Russian violinist Toscha Seidel played lead, with Einstein as second fiddle. In return for some violin tips, Einstein tried to explain relativity theory to Seidel and made him some drawings of moving rods contracting in length.<sup><a id="filepos1196755"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1886528">5</a></sup></p>

他和爱尔莎很快就找到了租住的房子，他们举办了一个小型音乐会以示庆祝。音乐会以海顿和莫扎特的作品为主，由著名俄国小提琴家托沙·塞德尔领奏，爱因斯坦担任第二小提琴手。塞德尔传授了一些小提琴技巧，作为答谢，爱因斯坦试图给他讲解相对论，画了一些图显示运动长杆的长度会收缩。

于是乎，小镇上流传的有关爱因斯坦热爱音乐的故事越来越多。其中一则说，爱因斯坦与小提琴大师弗里茨·克莱斯勒共同演奏四重奏，在某个地方他们没有同步。克莱斯勒停止了演奏，气冲冲地嘲笑爱因斯坦说：“怎么回事，教授，您不会数数吗？” 还有更动人的一则故事，一天晚上，一个基督教祈祷团举行集会，为遭受迫害的犹太人祷告。让他们没想到的是，爱因斯坦问他是否可以参加。他带来了小提琴，演奏了一首独奏曲，仿佛在祷告一样。

<p>Many of his performances were purely impromptu. That first Halloween, he disarmed some astonished trick-or-treaters, a group of 12-year-old girls who had come with the intent of playing a prank, by appearing at the door and serenading them with his violin. And at Christmastime, when members of the First Presbyterian Church came by to sing carols, he stepped out into the snow, borrowed a violin from one of the women, and accompanied them. “He was just a lovely person,” one of them recalled.<sup><a id="filepos1198114"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1887327">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Einstein soon acquired an image, which grew into a near legend but was nevertheless based on reality, of being a kindly and gentle professor, distracted at times but unfailingly sweet, who wandered about lost in thought, helped children with their homework, and rarely combed his hair or wore socks. With his amused sense of self-awareness, he catered to such perceptions. “I’m a kind of ancient figure known primarily for his non-use of socks and wheeled out on special occasions as a curiosity,” he joked. His slightly disheveled appearance was partly an assertion of his simplicity and partly a mild act of rebellion. “I have reached an age when, if someone tells me to wear socks, I don’t have to,” he told a neighbor.<sup><a id="filepos1198975"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1887510">9</a></sup></p>

在人们心目中，爱因斯坦是一个和蔼善良、温文尔雅的教授，可爱但有时心不在焉，经常一边散步一边沉浸在思考之中，还会帮助孩子们完成家庭作业，很少梳头或穿袜子。这几乎成了一个传奇，但并非没有事实依据。这种理解也符合他那种带有自知之明的幽默感。“我这种老古董主要是因为不穿袜子而出名，在特定场合会被当成怪人。”他开玩笑说。他不太修边幅，这既是对其朴素的肯定，又是一种温和的反叛行为。“人到了我这个年纪，如果有人让我穿袜子，我可以不穿。”他对邻居说。

<p>Actually, he knew, and he found it mildly amusing. He surrendered, for example, to Elsa’s nagging that he smoked too much and on Thanksgiving bet her that he would be able to abstain from his pipe until the new year. When Elsa boasted of this at a dinner party, Einstein grumbled, “You see, I am no longer a slave to my pipe, but I am a slave to that woman.” Einstein kept his word, but “he got up at daylight on New Year’s morning, and he hasn’t had his pipe out of his mouth since except to eat and sleep,” Elsa told neighbors a few days after the deal was over.<sup><a id="filepos1201328"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1887876">11</a></sup></p>

最终，罗斯福的社交秘书马文·麦金太尔打来电话，邀请爱因斯坦访问白宫。弗莱克斯纳事先得到了消息。他气急败坏地给白宫打电话，代表爱因斯坦冷冷地回绝了麦金太尔。弗莱克斯纳说，所有邀请都必须经他同意。

<p>For good measure, Flexner proceeded to write an official letter to the president. “I felt myself compelled this afternoon to explain to your secretary,” Flexner said, “that Professor Einstein had come to Princeton for the purpose of carrying out his scientific work in seclusion and that it was absolutely impossible to make any exception which would inevitably bring him into public notice.”</p>

<p>Einstein knew none of this until Henry Morgenthau, a prominent Jewish leader who was about to become treasury secretary, inquired about the apparent snub.

<p>The stars had aligned to create for Einstein a sense of inertia, or at least a weariness of further wandering. In addition, Princeton, which he called a “pipe as yet unsmoked” on his first visit in 1921, captured him with its leafy charm and its neo-Gothic echoes of a European university town. “A quaint and ceremonious village of puny demigods strutting on stiff legs,” he called it in a letter to Elisabeth, the queen mother of Belgium since the death of the king.“By ignoring certain social conventions, I have been able to create for myself an atmosphere conducive to study and free from distraction.”<sup><a id="filepos1212823"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1891019">23</a></sup></p>

The philosopher Sidney Hook, a recovering Marxist, wrote Einstein, asking him to speak out in favor of the creation of an international public commission to assure that Trotsky and his supporters would get a fair hearing rather than merely a show trial. “There is no doubt that every accused person should be given an opportunity to establish his innocence,” Einstein replied. “This certainly holds true for Trotsky.” But how should this be accomplished? Einstein suggested it would best be done privately, without a public commission.<sup><a id="filepos1253013"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1901498">65</a></sup></p>

1936年，莫斯科开始了更大规模的审讯，包括对流亡的利昂·托洛茨基的支持者。对于那些现已成为反共人士的以前的左派朋友，爱因斯坦再次拒绝了他们的请求。哲学家西德尼·胡克是一位恢复了正常的马克思主义者，他写信给爱因斯坦，请他呼吁建立一个国际公共委员会，以保证托洛茨基及其支持者能够得到一次公平的而非徒有其表的审讯。“毫无疑问，每一位被指控的人都应当有机会证明自己的清白，”爱因斯坦回信说，“对于托洛茨基当然也是如此。”但这如何能够办到？爱因斯坦建议最好私下进行，而不是成立公共委员会。

<p>In a very long letter, Hook tried to rebut each of Einstein’s concerns, but Einstein lost interest in arguing with Hook and did not respond. So Hook phoned him in Princeton. He reached Helen Dukas, and somehow was able to make it through her defensive shield to set up an appointment.</p>

胡克写了一封很长的信，试图逐一反驳爱因斯坦的想法。但爱因斯坦不再有兴趣与胡克争论，没有回复。于是胡克把电话打到了普林斯顿。他联系上了杜卡斯，竟然成功地过了她这关，约好了会谈时间。

<p>Einstein received Hook cordially, brought him up to his study lair, smoked his pipe, and spoke in English. After listening to Hook again <a id="filepos1253596"></a>make his case, Einstein expressed sympathy but said he thought the whole enterprise was unlikely to succeed. “From my point of view,” he proclaimed, “both Stalin and Trotsky are political gangsters.” Hook later said that even though he disagreed with Einstein, “I could appreciate his reasons,” especially because Einstein emphasized that he was “aware of what communists were capable of doing.”</p>

爱因斯坦诚挚地招待了胡克。在书房坐定后，他点上烟斗，用英语同胡克交谈。胡克重申了自己的观点，爱因斯坦听后表示了同情，但认为这件事不大可能成功。

<p>Wearing an old sweatshirt and no socks, Einstein walked Hook back to the train station. Along the way, he explained his anger at the Germans. They had raided his house in Caputh searching for communist weapons, he said, and found only a bread knife to confiscate. One remark he made turned out to be very prescient. “If and when war comes,” he said, “Hitler will realize the harm he has done Germany by driving out the Jewish scientists.”<sup><a id="filepos1254570"></a><a href="Einstein_split_036.html#filepos1901722">66</a></sup></p>

爱因斯坦穿着一件旧运动衫，没有穿袜子，送胡克到火车站。一路上，他诉说了自己对德国人的愤慨。他们查抄了他在卡普特的寓所，寻找共产主义者窝藏的武器，结果只找到了一把切面包的餐刀。事实证明，他有一句话很有预见力。“如果战争爆发，”他说，“希特勒驱逐犹太科学家对德国造成的伤害将最终实现。”
