After Einstein formulated his special theory of relativity in 1905, he realized that it was incomplete in at least two ways. First, it held that no physical interaction can <a href="#" title="propagate

网络普及；宣扬；传播法向
">propagate</a> faster than the speed of light; that conflicted with Newton’s theory of gravity, which conceived of gravity as a force that acted instantly between distant objects. Second, it applied only to constant-velocity motion. So for the next ten years, Einstein engaged in an interwoven effort to come up with a new field theory of gravity and to generalize his relativity theory so that it applied to accelerated motion.<sup><a id="filepos557158"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1716858">1</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
在1905年提出狭义相对论之后，爱因斯坦认识到它至少在两个意义上是不完备的。首先，规定任何物理相互作用的传播速度都不能超过光速，这与牛顿的引力定律相冲突，后者认为引力在远距离物体之间瞬时发生作用。其次，狭义相对论只适用于匀速运动。在接下来的十年里，爱因斯坦既希望提出一种新的引力场理论，又试图把相对论推广到加速运动。

His first major conceptual advance had come at the end of 1907, while he was writing about relativity for a science yearbook. As noted earlier, a thought experiment about what a free-falling observer would feel led him to embrace the principle that the local effects of being accelerated and of being in a gravitational field are indistinguishable.<a id="filepos557604"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1717003">*</a> A person in a closed windowless chamber who feels his feet pressed to the floor will not be able to tell whether it’s because the chamber is in outer space being accelerated upward or because it is at rest in a gravitational field. If he pulls a penny from his pocket and lets it go, it will fall to the floor at an accelerating speed in either case. Likewise, a person who feels she is floating in the closed chamber will not know whether it’s because the chamber is in free fall or hovering in a gravity-free region of outer space.<sup><a id="filepos558190"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1717003">2</a></sup>

<p>
1907年年底，在为一家科学年鉴撰写论文时，他终于在概念上第一次有了重大进展。我们在前面的章节曾经说过，他做了一个关于自由落体的观察者如何感觉的思想实验，由此得出了这样一个原理，即加速运动和处于引力场之中在局域效应上是无法区分的。一个人在密封舱中感到脚被地板支撑着，他无法判断这是由于密封舱正在外层空间向上加速，还是因为密封舱静止于引力场中。无论是哪种情形，倘若这时他从口袋里掏出一分钱，然后松开手，这枚硬币都会以相同的方式落到地板上。类似地，一个在密封舱中飘浮的人也弄不清楚，此时密封舱正在自由下落，还是正悬浮于没有引力的外层空间。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>



<a id="filepos558288"></a>This led Einstein to the formulation of an “equivalence principle” that would guide his quest for a theory of gravity and his attempt to generalize relativity. “I realized that I would be able to extend or generalize the principle of relativity to apply to accelerated systems in addition to those moving at a uniform velocity,” he later explained. “And in so doing, I expected that I would be able to resolve the problem of gravitation at the same time.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
为此，爱因斯坦提出了所谓的“等效原理”，以帮助他寻找一种引力理论和推广相对论。“我认识到，除了匀速运动的参照系，我将能够把相对性原理拓展和推广到加速系统，”他后来解释说，“我希望在这样做的同时能够解决引力问题。”

Just as inertial mass and gravitational mass are equivalent, so too there is an equivalence, he realized, between all inertial effects, such as resistance to acceleration, and gravitational effects, such as weight. His insight was that they are both manifestations of the same structure, which we now sometimes call the inertio-gravitational field.<sup><a id="filepos559196"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1718292">3</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
正因为惯性质量等于引力质量，所有惯性效应（比如对加速的反抗）与引力效应（比如重量）之间才存在着某种等效。爱因斯坦洞察到，它们是同一结构的两种表现，这种结构我们现在有时称为惯性－引力场。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

One consequence of this equivalence is that gravity, as Einstein had noted, should bend a light beam. That is easy to show using the chamber thought experiment. Imagine that the chamber is being accelerated upward. A laser beam comes in through a pinhole on one wall. By the time it reaches the opposite wall, it’s a little closer to the floor, because the chamber has shot upward. And if you could plot its trajectory across the chamber, it would be curved because of the upward acceleration. The equivalence principle says that this effect should be the same whether the chamber is accelerating upward or is instead resting still in a gravitational field. Thus, light should appear to bend when going through a gravitational field.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
正如爱因斯坦所指出的，这种等效的一个后果便是，引力会使光线弯曲。我们很容易用密封舱的思想实验来说明这一点。想象此时密封舱正在加速向上运动，一束光通过墙上的一个洞射进来。当这束光到达对面墙壁时候，它已经离地板近了一些，因为在这段时间里密封舱已经向上移动了一段距离。如果画出光通过密封舱的路径，那么它将因密封舱的向上加速而是弯曲的。等效原理说，不论密封舱是加速向上还是静止于引力场中，这一效应都是相同的。因此，光线在通过引力场时会发生弯曲。

For almost four years after positing this principle, Einstein did little with it. Instead, he focused on light quanta. But in 1911, he confessed to Michele Besso that he was weary of worrying about quanta, and he turned his attention back to coming up with a field theory of gravity that would help him generalize relativity. It was a task that would take him almost four more years, culminating in an eruption of genius in November 1915.

在提出这一原理后的四年时间里，爱因斯坦没有再怎么管它，而是转而思考光量子和辐射问题。然而在1911年，他对贝索说，量子问题的困扰已经使他疲惫不堪，他要重新开始思考如何用一种引力场理论来推广相对论。这项任务又将花费他大约四年时间，直到1915年11月的灵感迸发而达到最高峰。

In a paper he sent to the <em>Annalen der Physik</em> in June 1911, “On the <a id="filepos560667"></a>Influence of Gravity on the Propagation of Light,” he picked up his insight from 1907 and gave it rigorous expression. “In a memoir published four years ago I tried to answer the question whether the propagation of light is influenced by gravitation,” he began. “I now see that one of the most important consequences of my former treatment is capable of being tested experimentally.” After a series of calculations, Einstein came up with a prediction for light passing through the gravitational field next to the sun: “A ray of light going past the sun would undergo a deflection of 0.83 second of arc.”<a id="filepos561319"></a><a href="Einstein_split_056.html#filepos2412566">*</a>

<p>
1911年6月，他寄给《物理学纪事》一篇论文一《论引力对光的传播的影响》。在这篇论文中，他对1907年以来的思想给予了严格的表述。“在我四年前发表的一篇论文里，我曾试图回答这样一个问题：引力是否会影响光的传播，”他开门见山地说，“我现在发现，我以前论述的最重要的结果之一可以在实验上加以检验。”经过一系列计算，爱因斯坦预言了光通过太阳附近的引力场时发生的现象：“光线经过太阳附近时将会发生0.83弧秒的偏折。”

Once again, he was deducing a theory from grand principles and postulates, then deriving some predictions that experimenters could proceed to test. As before, he ended his paper by calling for just such a test. “As the stars in the parts of the sky near the sun are visible during total eclipses of the sun, this consequence of the theory may be observed. It would be a most desirable thing if astronomers would take up the question.”<sup><a id="filepos561862"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1718764">4</a></sup>

这一次，他同样是由基本原理和假设演绎出理论，然后推出某些预言供实验家检验。和往常一样，他在文章的结尾呼吁做这样的检验。“由于日全食期间可以看到太阳附近的恒星，因此可以对理论结果进行观测。但愿天文学家能够着手考虑这一问题，那将是相当值得的。” 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

<p>

Erwin Finlay Freundlich, a young astronomer at the Berlin University observatory, read the paper and became excited by the prospect of doing this test. But it could not be performed until an eclipse, when starlight passing near the sun would be visible, and there would be no suitable one for another three years.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
埃尔温·弗伦德里希是柏林大学天文台的一位年轻天文学家。他读到了这篇论文，很有兴趣做这一检验。然而，实验只有在日食期间才能做，因为那时才能观测到途经太阳附近的星光，而未来三年内不会出现合适的日食。

So Freundlich proposed that he try to measure the deflection of starlight caused by the gravitational field of Jupiter. Alas, Jupiter did not prove big enough for the task. “If only we had a truly larger planet than Jupiter!” Einstein joked to Freundlich at the end of that summer. “But nature did not deem it her business to make the discovery of her laws easy for us.”<sup><a id="filepos562729"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1719024">5</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
于是弗伦德里希提出，可以测量木星引力场所造成的星光偏折。可惜，对于这项任务来说，木星的质量还不够大。“要是有一颗比木星大得多的行星该多好！”爱因斯坦那年夏末对弗伦德里希开玩笑说，“然而大自然并不认为让我们能够轻易发现它的规律是分内之事。”

The theory that light beams could be bent led to some interesting questions. Everyday experience shows that light travels in straight lines. Carpenters now use laser levels to mark off straight lines and construct level houses. If a light beam curves as it passes through regions of changing gravitational fields, how can a straight line be determined?
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

光线可能会弯曲，这种理论引出了一些有趣的问题。日常经验表明，光总是沿直线传播。木匠现在会用激光水平尺来画直线，建造房屋。倘若光线通过变化的引力场时会发生弯曲，那么直线应当如何确定呢？
</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos563236"></a>One solution might be to liken the path of the light beam through a changing gravitational field to that of a line drawn on a sphere or on a surface that is warped. In such cases, the shortest line between two points is curved, a geodesic like a great arc or a great circle route on our globe. Perhaps the bending of light meant that the fabric of space, through which the light beam traveled, was curved by gravity. The shortest path through a region of space that is curved by gravity might seem quite different from the straight lines of Euclidean geometry.

一种解决方案是，把通过变化引力场的光线的路径类比于球面或曲面上的线。对于球面或曲面来说，两点之间最短的线是弯曲的，比如作为地球测地线的大弧或大圆。也许光线弯曲意味着，引力使光线通过的空间结构发生了弯曲。被引力弯曲的空间区域中的最短路径或许迥异于欧几里得几何学中的直线。

There was another clue that a new form of geometry might be needed. It became apparent to Einstein when he considered the case of a rotating disk. As a disk whirled around, its circumference would be contracted in the direction of its motion when observed from the reference frame of a person not rotating with it. The diameter of the circle, however, would not undergo any contraction. Thus, the ratio of the disk’s circumference to its diameter would no longer be given by pi. Euclidean geometry wouldn’t apply to such cases.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

还有一种解决方案是，需要一种新的几何学。爱因斯坦在思考旋转圆盘时想到了这一点。在不随同圆盘旋转的观察者看来，当圆盘旋转时，其圆周会沿着运动方向收缩，而直径却不会发生任何收缩。于是，圆盘的周长与直径之比不再是π，欧几里得几何学并不适用于这种情形。

Rotating motion is a form of acceleration, because at every moment a point on the rim is undergoing a change in direction, which means that its velocity (a combination of speed and direction) is undergoing a change. Because non-Euclidean geometry would be necessary to describe this type of acceleration, according to the equivalence principle, it would be needed for gravitation as well.<sup><a id="filepos564849"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1719188">6</a></sup>

旋转运动是一种加速运动，因为边缘上的点每时每刻都在发生变化，这意味着它的速度（包括速率和方向两个方面）在发生变化。这种加速需要用非欧几何来描述，所以根据等效原理，引力也需要用非欧几何来描述。

Unfortunately, as he had proved at the Zurich Polytechnic, non-Euclidean geometry was not a strong suit for Einstein. Fortunately, he had an old friend and classmate in Zurich for whom it was.

<h3><span><strong><em>The Math</em> 数学</strong></span></h3>

<div class="left">
<p>

When Einstein moved back to Zurich from Prague in July 1912, one of the first things he did was call on his friend Marcel Grossmann, who had taken the notes Einstein used when he skipped math classes at the Zurich Polytechnic. Einstein had gotten a 4.25 out of 6 in his two geometry courses at the Polytechnic. Grossmann, on the other hand, had scored a perfect 6 in both of his geometry courses, had written his dissertation on non-Euclidean geometry, published seven papers on that topic, and was now the chairman of the math department.<sup><a id="filepos565855"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1719322">7</a></sup>

<p>


1912年7月，爱因斯坦从布拉格搬回苏黎世后，最先做的事情之一就是拜访他的朋友格罗斯曼。他在苏黎世联邦工学院逃数学课时，格罗斯曼曾帮他记笔记。那时，爱因斯坦的两门几何课都是4.25分，而格罗斯曼都得了满分6分。格罗斯曼的博士论文是关于非欧几何的，还发表过相关的七篇论文。他现在是数学系主任。 

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos565953"></a>“Grossmann, you’ve got to help me or I will go crazy,” Einstein said. He explained that he needed a mathematical system that would express—and perhaps even help him discover—the laws that governed the gravitational field. “Instantly, he was all afire,” Einstein recalled of Grossmann’s response.<sup><a id="filepos566308"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1719623">8</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>



“格罗斯曼，你一定要帮帮我，否则我会发疯的。”爱因斯坦说。他解释说，他需要一个数学系统来表示（甚至是帮他发现）支配引力场的定律。“他立即产生了极大兴趣。”爱因斯坦后来这样回忆格罗斯曼当时的反应。 

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Until then, Einstein’s scientific success had been based on his special talent for sniffing out the underlying physical principles of nature. He had left to others the task, which to him seemed less exalted, of finding the best mathematical expressions of those principles, as his Zurich colleague Minkowski had done for special relativity.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

直到那时，爱因斯坦的科学成功一直得益于他在揭示大自然背后物理原理方面的惊人能力。他总是让别人去寻找关于这些原理的最佳数学表述，比如他的苏黎世同事闵可夫斯基在狭义相对论方面做的就是这种工作。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

But by 1912, Einstein had come to appreciate that math could be a tool for discovering—and not merely describing—nature’s laws. Math was nature’s playbook. “The central idea of general relativity is that gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime,” says physicist James Hartle. “Gravity <em>is</em> geometry.”<sup><a id="filepos567175"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1719777">9</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

然而到了1912年，爱因斯坦开始认识到，数学也许是发现，而不仅仅是描述一自然定律的一种工具。数学是大自然的剧本。“广义相对论的核心思想就是，引力源于时空弯曲，”物理学家詹姆斯·哈特尔说，“引力就是几何。”

“I am now working exclusively on the gravitation problem and I believe that, with the help of a mathematician friend here, I will overcome all difficulties,” Einstein wrote to the physicist Arnold Sommerfeld. “I have gained enormous respect for mathematics, whose more subtle parts I considered until now, in my ignorance, as pure luxury!”<sup><a id="filepos567641"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1719908">10</a></sup>

“我正在一门心思研究引力问题，我相信，在这里一位数学家朋友的帮助下，我能够克服所有困难，”爱因斯坦写信给物理学家索默菲，“对于数学，我产生了极大的敬意，在此之前我一直愚蠢地认为，数学中更为奥妙的部分纯粹是一种奢侈！”

Grossmann went home to think about the question. After consulting the literature, he came back to Einstein and recommended the non-Euclidean geometry that had been devised by Bernhard Riemann.<sup><a id="filepos567937"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1720074">11</a></sup>

格罗斯曼开始思考这个问题。在查阅了相关文献之后，他建议爱因斯坦关注伯恩哈特·黎曼曾经提出的非欧几何。

Riemann (1826–1866) was a child prodigy who invented a perpetual calendar at age 14 as a gift for his parents and went on to study in the great math center of Göttingen, Germany, under Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been pioneering the geometry of curved surfaces. This was the topic Gauss assigned to Riemann for a thesis, and the result would transform not only geometry but physics.

Euclidean geometry describes flat surfaces. But it does not hold true on curved surfaces. For example, the sum of the angles of a triangle on a flat page is 180°. But look at the globe and picture a triangle formed by the equator as the base, the line of longitude running from the equator to the North Pole through London (longitude 0°) as one side, and the line of longitude running from the equator to the North Pole through New Orleans (longitude 90°) as the third side. If you look <a id="filepos568990"></a>at this on a globe, you will see that all three angles of this triangle are right angles, which of course is impossible in the flat world of Euclid.

欧氏几何可以描述平直表面，但对于弯曲表面并不适用。例如，平面三角形的内角和等于180°。但如果在地球仪上作一个三角形，以赤道为底，从赤道通过伦敦到达北极的经线（经度0°）为一边，从赤道通过新奥尔良到达北极的经线（经度90°）为第三边，那么你将看到，这个三角形的所有内角都是直角，而这在几的直世中是不的。

Gauss and others had developed different types of geometry that could describe the surface of spheres and other curved surfaces. Riemann took things even further: he developed a way to describe a surface no matter how its geometry changed, even if it varied from spherical to flat to hyperbolic from one point to the next. He also went beyond dealing with the curvature of just two-dimensional surfaces and, building on the work of Gauss, explored the various ways that math could describe the curvature of three-dimensional and even four-dimensional space.

高斯等人发展出了不同类型的几何学，以描述球面或其他曲面。黎曼则走得更远，他提出了一种描述表面的万能方法，不论该表面的几何如何变化，哪怕它从球面变到平面再变到双曲面，都可以运用这种方法。他不仅探讨了二维表面的曲率，还在高斯著作的基础上，探讨了描述三维甚至四维空间曲率的各种数学方式。

That is a challenging concept. We can visualize a curved line or surface, but it is hard to imagine what curved three-dimensional space would be like, much less a curved four dimensions. But for mathematicians, extending the concept of curvature into different dimensions is easy, or at least doable. This involves using the concept of the <em>metric,</em> which specifies how to calculate the distance between two points in space.

这真是一种富有挑战性的概念。我们可以设想一条曲线或一个曲面，但很难想象弯曲的三维空间是什么样子，更不要说弯曲的四维空间了。然而，数学家却很容易把曲率概念拓展到不同维度，至少它在数学上是可行的。这涉及所谓的度规概念，它规定了如何计算空间中两点之间的距离。

On a flat surface with just the normal <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coordinates, any high school algebra student, with the help of old Pythagoras, can calculate the distance between points. But imagine a flat map (of the world, for example) that represents locations on what is actually a curved globe. Things get stretched out near the poles, and measurement gets more complex. Calculating the actual distance between two points on the map in Greenland is different from doing so for points near the equator. Riemann worked out ways to determine mathematically the distance between points in space no matter how arbitrarily it curved and contorted.<sup><a id="filepos570955"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1720947">12</a></sup>

在只有x坐标和y坐标的正常平面上，任何高中生在老毕达哥拉斯的帮助下都可以计算出两点间的距离。但在一张用来表示弯曲球面上各个位置的平面地图（比如世界地图）上，距离在极点附近被拉长，测量变得更加复杂。计算格陵兰岛上两点的间距不同于计算赤道附近两点的间距。黎曼找到了确定空间中两点之间距离的数学方法，无论它如何弯曲或扭曲。

To do so he used something called a tensor. In Euclidean geometry, a vector is a quantity (such as of velocity or force) that has both a magnitude and a direction and thus needs more than a single simple number to describe it. In non-Euclidean geometry, where space is curved, we need something more generalized—sort of a vector on steroids—in order to incorporate, in a mathematically orderly way, more components. These are called tensors.

为此，他运用了张量这种数学概念。在欧氏几何中，矢量是既有大小又有方向的量，比如速度或力，它需要用一个以上的数来描述。而在非欧几何中，空间是弯曲的，我们需要有某种更一般的东西才能在数学上包含更多的成分，这就是所谓的张量。

A <em>metric tensor</em> is a mathematical tool that tells us how to calculate <a id="filepos571643"></a>the distance between points in a given space. For two-dimensional maps, a metric tensor has three components. For three-dimensional space, it has six independent components.

利用度规张量这种数学工具，我们能够计算出给定空间中两点之间的距离。对于二维地图，度规张量有3个分量。对于三维空间，度规张量有6个独立分量。而对于所谓的四维时空，度规张量则有10个独立分量。

Riemann helped to develop this concept of the metric tensor, which was denoted as <em>g</em><sub>mn</sub> and pronounced <em>gee-mu-nu.</em> It had sixteen components, ten of them independent of one another, that could be used to define and describe a distance in curved four-dimensional spacetime.<sup><a id="filepos572348"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1721081">13</a></sup>

The useful thing about Riemann’s tensor, as well as other tensors that Einstein and Grossmann adopted from the Italian mathematicians Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita, is that they are <em>generally covariant.</em> This was an important concept for Einstein as he tried to generalize a theory of relativity. It meant that the relationships between their components remained the same even when there were arbitrary changes or rotations in the space and time coordinate system. In other words, the information encoded in these tensors could go through a variety of transformations based on a changing frame of reference, but the basic laws governing the relationship of the components to each other remained the same.<sup><a id="filepos573188"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1721310">14</a></sup>

黎曼张量，以及爱因斯坦和格罗斯曼从意大利数学家里奇和莱维-契维塔的著作中了解到的其他张量的关键用处是，它们都是广义协变的。当爱因斯坦试图推广相对论时，这对他来说是一个重要概念。它意味着，不论时空坐标系如何变化或旋转，其各个分量的关系仍然保持不变。换句话说，虽然编入这些张量中的信息可以因参照系的改变而发生变化，但支配其各个分量之间关系的基本定律却不会改变。

Years later, when his younger son, Eduard, asked why he was so famous, Einstein replied by using a simple image to describe his great insight that gravity was the curving of the fabric of spacetime. “When a blind beetle crawls over the surface of a curved branch, it doesn’t notice that the track it has covered is indeed curved,” he said. “I was lucky enough to notice what the beetle didn’t notice.”<sup><a id="filepos574620"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1721654">16</a></sup>

<h3><span><strong><em>The Zurich Notebook, 1912</em> 苏黎世笔记本，1912年</strong></span></h3>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Beginning in that summer of 1912, Einstein struggled to develop gravitational field equations using tensors along the lines developed by Riemann, Ricci, and others. His first round of fitful efforts are preserved in a scratchpad notebook. Over the years, this revealing “Zurich Notebook” has been dissected and analyzed by a team of scholars including Jürgen Renn, John D. Norton, Tilman Sauer, Michel Janssen, and John Stachel.<sup><a id="filepos575301"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1721809">17</a></sup>

从1912年夏天开始，爱因斯坦试图沿着黎曼、里奇等人提供的思路用张量来研究引力场方程。他最初的努力都记在一个便条簿中。多年来，雷恩、诺顿、绍尔、扬森和斯塔契尔等学者已经对这一极有启发性的“苏黎世笔记本”进行了细致入微的研究，使我们得以窥见他的思想发展。

In it Einstein pursued a two-fisted approach. On the one hand, he engaged in what was called a “physical strategy,” in which he tried to build the correct equations from a set of requirements dictated by his feel for the physics. At the same time, he pursued a “mathematical strategy,” in which he tried to deduce the correct equations from the more formal math requirements using the tensor analysis that Gross-mann and others recommended.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


在其中，爱因斯坦沿两个方向进行了探索。一方面是“物理方案”，即根据物理学直觉提出要求，并由此找到正确的方程；另一方面是“数学方案”，即运用格罗斯曼等人建议的张量分析方法，试图根据更加形式化的数学要求导出正确的方程。

</div></div>



<div class="layout">

Einstein’s “physical strategy” began with his mission to generalize the principle of relativity so that it applied to observers who were accelerating or moving in an arbitrary manner. Any gravitational field equation he devised would have to meet the following physical requirements:
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦的“物理方案”始于对相对性原理的推广，即试图使相对性原理适用于正在加速运动的观察者。任何引力场方程都必须满足如下物理要求：

在静态弱引力场的情况下，必须转化为牛顿理论。换句话说，在正常条件下，他的理论应该能够描述我们所熟悉的牛顿的引力和运动定律。

Einstein’s “mathematical strategy,” on the other hand, focused on using generic mathematical knowledge about the metric tensor to find a gravitational field equation that was generally (or at least broadly) covariant.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦的“数学方案，则试图用关于度规张量的数学知识找到一个广义协变的引力场方程。

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

The process worked both ways: Einstein would examine equations that were abstracted from his physical requirements to check their covariance properties, and he would examine equations that sprang from elegant mathematical formulations to see if they met the requirements of his physics. “On page after page of the notebook, he approached the problem from either side, here writing expressions suggested by the physical requirements of the Newtonian limit and energy-momentum conservation, there writing expressions naturally suggested by the generally covariant quantities supplied by the mathematics of Ricci and Levi-Civita,” says John Norton.<sup><a id="filepos578064"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1722090">18</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
爱因斯坦双管齐下，一方面考察由物理要求所得出的方程，检验其协变性：另一方面考察由美妙的数学表达式导出的方程，看它们是否满足物理要求。“在这个笔记本中，他一直都试图从两个进路解决问题，时而写出由牛顿极限和能量动量守恒等物理要求所预示的表达式，时而写出由里奇和莱维-契维塔的广义协变量所预示的表达式。”诺顿说。 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

But something disappointing happened. The two groups of requirements did not mesh. Or at least Einstein thought not. He could not get the results produced by one strategy to meet the requirements of the other strategy.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

但令人失望的是，这两组要求并不匹配，至少爱因斯坦是这样认为的。他无法使一种方案的结果满足另一种方案的要求。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Using his mathematical strategy, he derived some very elegant equations. At Grossmann’s suggestion, he had begun using a tensor developed by Riemann and then a more suitable one developed by Ricci. Finally, by the end of 1912, he had devised a field equation using a tensor that was, it turned out, pretty close to the one that he would eventually use in his triumphant formulation of late November 1915. In <a id="filepos578852"></a>other words, in his Zurich Notebook he had come up with what was quite close to the right solution.<sup><a id="filepos578963"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1722326">19</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

运用数学方案，他导出了一些非常美妙的方程。在格罗斯曼建议下，他开始使用黎曼张量以及更加适合的里奇张量。到了1912年年底，他设计出了一个场方程，这与1915年11月底最终提出的场方程相当接近。换句话说，他在苏黎世笔记本中提出了近乎正确的解答。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

But then he rejected it, and it would stagnate in his discard pile for more than two years. Why? Among other considerations, he thought (somewhat mistakenly) that this solution did not reduce, in a weak and static field, to Newton’s laws. When he tried it a different way, it did not meet the requirement of the conservation of energy and momentum. And if he introduced a coordinate condition that allowed the equations to satisfy one of these requirements, it proved incompatible with the conditions needed to satisfy the other requirement.<sup><a id="filepos579614"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1722577">20</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


但随后他放弃了这个方程，而且一放就是两年多。为什么会这样？一个原因是，他（不太正确地）认为，这一解答在静态弱场的情况下没有还原为牛顿定律，也不满足能量动量守恒的要求。如果通过引入坐标条件，使方程满足其中一种要求，那么又无法满足另一种要求的条件。 
</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

As a result, Einstein reduced his reliance on the mathematical strategy. It was a decision that he would later regret. Indeed, after he finally returned to the mathematical strategy and it proved spectacularly successful, he would from then on proclaim the virtues—both scientific and philosophical—of mathematical formalism.<sup><a id="filepos580055"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1723070">21</a></sup>

<p>




结果，爱因斯坦抛弃了数学方案，这一决定后来使他追悔莫及。事实上，最终使他大获成功的正是数学方案。从那以后，他将一直强调数学形式主义的优点，无论在科学上还是在哲学上。

<h3><span><strong><em>The</em> Entwurf <em>and Newton’s Bucket, 1913</em> 《纲要》和牛顿的水桶，1913年</strong></span></h3>

<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

In May 1913, having discarded the equations derived from the mathematical strategy, Einstein and Grossmann produced a sketchy alternative theory based more on the physical strategy. Its equations were constructed to conform to the requirements of energy-momentum conservation and of being compatible with Newton’s laws in a weak static field.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


1913年5月，在抛弃了由数学方案导出的方程之后，爱因斯坦和格罗斯曼又基于物理方案提出了一种概要性的理论。其方程应当能够满足能量动量守恒的要求，并且在静态弱场的情况下能够与牛顿定律相容。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Even though it did not seem that these equations satisfied the goal of being suitably covariant, Einstein and Grossmann felt it was the best they could do for the time being. Their title reflected their tentativeness: “Outline of a Generalized Theory of Relativity and of a Theory of Gravitation.” The paper thus became known as the <em>Entwurf,</em> which was the German word they had used for “outline.”<sup><a id="filepos581152"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1723571">22</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


虽然这些方程的协变性似乎还不够，但爱因斯坦和格罗斯曼认为这是他们目前所能做到的极致了。从文章的标题就可以看出其尝试性：《广义相对论和引力理论纲要》，这就是后来所谓的《纲要》（Entzuurf）一文。 

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

For a few months after producing the <em>Entwurf,</em> Einstein was both pleased and depleted. “I finally solved the problem a few weeks ago,” he wrote Elsa. “It is a bold extension of the theory of relativity, together with a theory of gravitation. Now I must give myself some rest, otherwise I will go kaput.”<sup><a id="filepos581591"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1723902">23</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

写出《纲要》之后，爱因斯坦既深感幸福又疲惫不堪。“几个星期以前，我终于把问题解决了，”他写信给爱尔莎说，“它大胆拓展了相对论和引力理论。现在我必须稍事休息，否则会垮掉的。” 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

However, he was soon questioning what he had wrought. And the <a id="filepos581752"></a>more he reflected on the <em>Entwurf,</em> the more he realized that its equations did not satisfy the goal of being generally or even broadly covariant. In other words, the way the equations applied to people in arbitrary accelerated motion might not always be the same.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

然而没过多久，他就开始质疑这项工作。他越是反思，就越认识到《纲要》的方程并不满足广义协变的目标。换句话说，也许并不能总是以同一种方式将方程运用于各种加速运动。

His confidence in the theory was not strengthened when he sat down with his old friend Michele Besso, who had come to visit him in June 1913, to study the implications of the <em>Entwurf</em> theory. They produced more than fifty pages of notes on their deliberations, each writing about half, which analyzed how the <em>Entwurf</em> accorded with some curious facts that were known about the orbit of Mercury.<sup><a id="filepos582502"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1724064">24</a></sup>

1913年6月，他与来访的老友贝索一起研究《纲要》理论，当时他并未建立起对该理论的信心。他们进行了深入研究，做了50多页的笔记，分析了《纲要》如何与关于水星轨道的一些古怪事实相一致。

Since the 1840s, scientists had been worrying about a small but unexplained shift in the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion is the spot in a planet’s elliptical orbit when it is closest to the sun, and over the years this spot in Mercury’s orbit had slipped a tiny amount more—about 43 seconds of an arc each century—than what was explained by Newton’s laws. At first it was assumed that some undiscovered planet was tugging at it, similar to the reasoning that had earlier led to the discovery of Neptune. The Frenchman who discovered Mercury’s anomaly even calculated where such a planet would be and named it Vulcan. But it was not there.

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

自19世纪40年代以来，科学家们一直耿耿于怀于水星轨道的一种微小移动得不到解释。近日点是行星橢圆轨道上距离太阳最近的点。人们注意到，水星近日点的移动，即大约每世纪43弧秒，要比牛顿定律的预言略大一些。起初人们以为，这是由于某颗尚未发现的行星在牵引着它，类似于较早前海王星的发现过程。发现水星反常的那位法国人甚至计算了这颗未知行星的可能位置，并把它命名为“火神星”。但事实上，它并不在那里。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein hoped that his new theory of relativity, when its gravitational field equations were applied to the sun, would explain Mercury’s orbit. Unfortunately, after a lot of calculations and corrected mistakes, he and Besso came up with a value of 18 seconds of an arc per century for how far Mercury’s perihelion should stray, which was not even halfway correct. The poor result convinced Einstein not to publish the Mercury calculations. But it did not convince him to discard his <em>Entwurf</em> theory, at least not yet.

爱因斯坦希望新的引力场方程能够解释水星的轨道。不幸的是，经过大量计算和修正，他和贝索得出的水星近日点运动的值是每世纪18弧秒，这个值甚至还不到正确值的一半。由于结果不理想，爱因斯坦决定暂不发表这些计算，但却并没有抛弃《纲要》理论，至少当时还没有。

Einstein and Besso also looked at whether rotation could be considered a form of relative motion under the equations of the <em>Entwurf</em> theory. In other words, imagine that an observer is rotating and thus experiencing inertia. Is it possible that this is yet another case of relative motion and is indistinguishable from a case where the observer is at rest and the rest of the universe is rotating around him?
</p>

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

根据《纲要》理论方程，爱因斯坦和贝索也探讨了旋转运动是否可以看成某种相对运动。换句话说，想象一个观察者正在旋转，并体验到惯性，这是否可能是另一种情形的相对运动，它与观察者静止、宇宙的其余部分围绕他旋转的情形不可区分？


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

The most famous thought experiment along these lines was that described by Newton in the third book of his <em>Principia.</em> Imagine a <a id="filepos584538"></a>bucket that begins to rotate as it hangs from a rope. At first the water in the bucket stays rather still and flat. But soon the friction from the bucket causes the water to spin around with it, and it assumes a concave shape. Why? Because inertia causes the spinning water to push outward, and therefore it pushes up the side of the bucket.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


牛顿在其《自然哲学的数学原理》的第三卷描述了这方面最著名的思想实验。想象一个水桶吊在一根绳子上开始旋转。起初，桶中的水几乎静止，水面是平的，但是不久，桶壁的摩擦使水和桶一起旋转，水面呈凹形。为什么？因为惯性使旋转的水向外推压，从而冲上桶壁。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Yes, but if we suspect that all motion is relative, we ask: What is the water spinning relative to? Not the bucket, because the water is concave when it is spinning along with the bucket, and also when the bucket stops and the water keeps spinning inside for a while. Perhaps the water is spinning relative to nearby bodies such as the earth that exert gravitational force.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


的确如此。但如果我们怀疑一切运动都是相对的，那么我们会问：水正相对于什么旋转呢？不是桶，因为水在和桶一起旋转时呈凹形，而且当水桶停止后，水仍然会在里面旋转一段时间。也许水正相对于邻近的物体旋转，比如施予引力的地球。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

But imagine the bucket spinning in deep space with no gravity and no reference points. Or imagine it spinning alone in an otherwise empty universe. Would there still be inertia? Newton believed so, and said it was because the bucket was spinning relative to absolute space.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

但是想象水桶在没有引力、没有参照点的宇宙空间中旋转，或者想象它正在一个空荡荡的宇宙中旋转，那么是否仍然存在惯性？牛顿相信仍然存在，因为他认为水桶正在相对于绝对空间旋转。

</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

When Einstein’s early hero Ernst Mach came along in the mid-nineteenth century, he debunked this notion of absolute space and argued that the inertia existed because the water was spinning relative to the rest of the matter in the universe. Indeed, the same effects would be observed if the bucket was still and the rest of the universe was rotating around it, he said.<sup><a id="filepos586083"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1724238">25</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

19世纪中叶，爱因斯坦早年崇拜的马赫批判了这种绝对空间的概念。他认为，惯性之所以存在，是因为水正相对于宇宙中其余的物质旋转。他说，倘若水桶静止不动，宇宙的其余部分围绕它旋转，也能观察到同样的效应。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

The general theory of relativity, Einstein hoped, would have what he dubbed “Mach’s Principle” as one of its touchstones. Happily, when he analyzed the equations in his <em>Entwurf</em> theory, he concluded that they <em>did</em> seem to predict that the effects would be the same whether a bucket was spinning or was motionless while the rest of the universe spun around it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦希望，广义相对论能够将所谓的“马赫原理”当成一个检验标准。令他喜出望外的是，通过对《纲要》理论中的方程进行分析，他的结论是，它们似乎的确预言了，不论是水桶旋转，还是水桶静止而宇宙的其余部分围绕它旋转，效应都是一样的。

Or so Einstein thought. He and Besso made a series of very clever calculations designed to see if indeed this was the case. In their notebook, Einstein wrote a joyous little exclamation at what appeared to be the successful conclusion of these calculations: “Is correct.”

Einstein would eventually discover those errors two years later and realize, unhappily, that the <em>Entwurf</em> did not in fact satisfy Mach’s principle. In all likelihood, Besso had already warned him that this might be the case. In a memo that he apparently wrote in August 1913, Besso <a id="filepos587333"></a>suggested that a “rotation metric” was not in fact a solution permitted by the field equations in the <em>Entwurf.</em>

不幸的是，他和贝索在这项工作中犯了一些错误。爱因斯坦两年后终于发现了它们，并且认识到《纲要》实际上并不满足马赫原理。贝索很可能提醒过他。在一份可能写于1913年8月的备忘录中，贝索说，“旋转度规”实际上并非《纲要》中的场方程所允许的解。

But Einstein dismissed these doubts, in letters to Besso as well as to Mach and others, at least for the time being.<sup><a id="filepos587649"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1724980">26</a></sup> If experiments upheld the theory, “your brilliant investigations on the foundations of mechanics will have received a splendid confirmation,” Einstein wrote to Mach days after the <em>Entwurf</em> was published. “For it shows that inertia has its origin in some kind of interaction of the bodies, exactly in accordance with your argument about Newton’s bucket experiment.”<sup><a id="filepos588099"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1725872">27</a></sup>

但在给贝索、马赫等人的信中，爱因斯坦当时并没有理会这种怀疑。 如果实验支持这种理论，“那么您在力学基础方面的卓越研究将得到很好的证实，”爱因斯坦在《纲要》发表后写信给马赫说，“因为它表明惯性源自物体之间的某种相互作用，恰恰符合您关于牛顿水桶实验所做的论证。”

What worried Einstein most about the <em>Entwurf,</em> justifiably, was that its mathematical equations did not prove to be generally covariant, thus deflating his goal of assuring that the laws of nature were the same for an observer in accelerated or arbitrary motion as they were for an observer moving at a constant velocity. “Regrettably, the whole business is still so very tricky that my confidence in the theory is still rather hesitant,” he wrote in reply to a warm letter of congratulations from Lorentz.“The gravitational equations themselves unfortunately do not have the property of general covariance.”<sup><a id="filepos588843"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1726065">28</a></sup>

关于《纲要》，最令爱因斯坦忧虑的是，它的数学方程并不是广义协变的，从而无法保证自然定律对于加速运动的观察者和以恒定速度运动的观察者是一样的。“遗憾的是，此事仍然非常棘手，导致我对这一理论的信心不是很足，”他在回复洛伦兹的贺信时写道，“不幸引力方程本身并不具有广义协变性。”

He was soon able to convince himself, at least for a while, that this was inevitable.

他很快便意识到这是不可避免的。这部分是通过一个思想实验做到的，它后来被称为“空穴论证” 。这个论证似乎暗示，引力场方程不可能实现广义协变。“引力方程并不是广义协变的，这在长时间里一直困扰着我，现已证明是不可避免的，”他给一位朋友写信说，“如果场在数学上完全由物质所决定，那么就很容易证明，带有广义协变方程的理论不可能存在。”

在当时，很少有物理学家支持爱因斯坦的新理论，许多人甚至公开指责它。 但爱因斯坦依然满心欢喜，他对朋友仓格尔说，人们至少已经在相对性问题上“倾注了必要的精力。我喜爱争论，用费加罗的话说，我尊贵的伯爵敢于跳舞吗？他应该告诉我！我将为他定调’”。

Through it all, Einstein continued to try to salvage his <em>Entwurf</em> approach. He was able to find ways, or so he thought, to achieve enough <a id="filepos590550"></a>covariance to satisfy most aspects of his principle about the equivalence of gravity and acceleration. “I succeeded in proving that the gravitational equations hold for arbitrarily moving reference systems, and thus that the hypothesis of the equivalence of acceleration and gravitational field is absolutely correct,” he wrote Zangger in early 1914. “Nature shows us only the tail of the lion. But I have no doubt that the lion belongs with it even if he cannot reveal himself all at once.

在这一过程中，爱因斯坦始终试图挽救他的《纲要》。他想方设法获取足够的协变性，以满足关于引力和加速的等效原理的大部分方面。“我成功证明了引力方程对于任意运动的参照系仍然成立，因此关于加速与引力场等效的假说是绝对正确的，”他1914年年初写信给仓格尔说，“大自然只把狮子的尾巴显露给了我们。但我确信无疑，狮子是个庞然大物，尚不能立即全部显露在我们眼前。我们见到的就像叮在狮子身上的虱子所见到的一样。”

<p>

There was, Einstein knew, one way to quell doubts. He often concluded his papers with suggestions for how future experiments could confirm whatever he had just propounded. In the case of general relativity, this process had begun in 1911, when he specified with some precision how much he thought light from a star would be deflected by the gravity of the sun.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦知道，有一种办法可以消除疑虑。他经常在论文结尾提出一些实验建议以证实他的观点。至于广义相对论，他1911年就已经给出了太阳引力使星光偏折的估计值。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

This was something that could, he hoped, be measured by photographing stars whose light passed close to the sun and determining whether there appeared to be a tiny shift in their position compared to when their light did not have to pass right by the sun. But this was an experiment that had to be done during an eclipse, when the starlight would be visible.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

他提出，这可以通过对星体进行摄影来测量，我们只需确定星光掠过太阳时星体的位置与星光不被太阳偏折时所对应的星体位置是否存在微小的偏移。但这个实验只有在日食期间星光可见时才能进行。

So it was not surprising that, with his theory arousing noisy attacks from colleagues and quiet doubts in his own mind, Einstein became keenly interested in what could be discovered during the next suitable total eclipse of the sun, which was due to occur on August 21, 1914. That would require an expedition to the Crimea, in Russia, where the path of the eclipse would fall.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

他的理论引发了同行们的激烈批评，他本人也有一定怀疑。因此，当爱因斯坦听说，1914年8月21日将会发生下一次日全食时，他对此抱以极大热情。届时需要一支远征队奔赴俄国的克里米亚观察日食。



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein was so eager to have his theory tested during the eclipse that, when it seemed there might be no money for such an expedition, he offered to pay part of the costs himself. Erwin Freundlich, the young Berlin astronomer who had read the light-bending predictions in Einstein’s 1911 paper and become eager to prove him correct, was ready to take the lead. “I am extremely pleased that you have taken up the question of the bending of light with so much zeal,” Einstein wrote <a id="filepos593136"></a>him in early 1912. In August 1913, he was still bombarding the astronomer with encouragement.“Nothing more can be done by the theorists,” he wrote. “In this matter it is only you, the astronomers, who can next year perform a simply invaluable service to theoretical physics.”<sup><a id="filepos593447"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1729573">34</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦热切盼望他的理论能够在日食期间得到检验，以至于当这支远征队面临经费不足的困境时，他甘愿亲自承担一部分费用。埃尔温·弗伦德里希是一位年轻的柏林天文学家，他曾经读过爱因斯坦1911年论文中对光线偏折的预言，很愿意能够牵头证明这个结论。爱因斯坦在1912年年初写信给他说：“您对光线弯曲问题的研究如此热心，我感到十分高兴。”1913年8月，爱因斯坦仍然在想方设法鼓动天文学家。“在这里，理论家们已经爱莫能助，”他写道，“明年，只有你们天文学家能够为理论物理学做出极其宝贵的贡献。”

Freundlich got married in August 1913 and decided to take his honeymoon in the mountains near Zurich, in the hope that he could meet Einstein. It worked. When Freundlich described his honeymoon schedule in a letter, Einstein invited him over for a visit. “This is wonderful because it fits in with our plans,” Freundlich wrote his fiancée, whose reaction to the prospect of spending part of her honeymoon with a theoretical physicist she had never met is lost to history.

1913年8月，新婚燕尔的弗伦德里希决定在苏黎世附近山区度蜜月，他希望能够见到爱因斯坦。这一愿望没有落空。弗伦德里希在一封信中谈了他在蜜月期间的安排，爱因斯坦知道后便邀请他来访问。“这真是妙极了，因为它很符合我们的计划。”弗伦德里希写信给未婚妻说。至于后者对蜜月期间将与一位从未谋面的理论物理学家一同度过有何反应，我们则无从知晓。

When the newlyweds pulled into the Zurich train station, there was a disheveled Einstein wearing, as Freundlich’s wife recalled, a large straw hat, with the plump chemist Fritz Haber at his side. Einstein brought the group to a nearby town where he was giving a lecture, after which he took them to lunch. Not surprisingly, he had forgotten to bring any money, and an assistant who had come along slipped him a 100 franc note under the table. For most of the day, Freundlich discussed gravity and the bending of light with Einstein, even when the group went on a nature hike, leaving his new wife to admire the scenery in peace.<sup><a id="filepos594730"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1729831">35</a></sup>

当这对新婚夫妇到达苏黎世火车站时，弗伦德里希的妻子回忆说，头发凌乱的爱因斯坦戴着一顶大草帽，身旁站着体态臃肿的化学家哈伯。爱因斯坦把他们带到附近的一个镇上，并在那里做了一场讲演，然后共进午餐。毫不奇怪，他忘了带钱，还是一位助手从桌下偷偷递给他一张100法郎的钞票，算是解了燃眉之急。弗伦德里希那天一直都在与爱因斯坦讨论引力和光的弯曲问题，甚至在野外散步时也在聚精会神地讨论，弗伦德里希的新婚妻子只得在一旁独自欣赏静谧的景色。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

At his speech that day, which was on general relativity, Einstein pointed out Freundlich to the audience and called him “the man who will be testing the theory next year.”The problem, however, was raising the money. At the time, Planck and others were trying to lure Einstein from Zurich to Berlin to become a member of the Prussian Academy, and Einstein used the courtship to write Planck and urge him to provide Freundlich the money to undertake the task.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

在当天关于广义相对论的讲演中，爱因斯坦向听众介绍弗伦德里希，称他“将在明年检验理论”。然而，资金是个问题。当时，普朗克等人正试图游说爱因斯坦从苏黎世搬到柏林担任普鲁士科学院院士，爱因斯坦则趁此机会给普朗克写信，敦促他为弗伦德里希提供资金完成这项任务。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

In fact, on the very day that Einstein formally accepted the Berlin post and election to the Academy—December 7, 1913—he wrote Freundlich with the offer to reach into his own pocket. “If the Academy shies away from it, then we will get that little bit of mammon from private individuals,” said Einstein. “Should everything fail, then I will pay for the thing myself out of the little bit that I have saved, at least the first 2,000 marks.” The main thing, Einstein stressed, was that <a id="filepos595875"></a>Freundlich should proceed with his preparations. “Just go ahead and order the photographic plates, and do not let the time be squandered because of the money problem.”<sup><a id="filepos596066"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1729963">36</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

事实上，就在1913年12月7日，即爱因斯坦正式接受柏林的职位并当选院士那天，他还写信给弗伦德里希提议他将自掏腰包。“如果科学院准许，我就准备向私人筹集经费，”爱因斯坦说，“如果各种办法都失败了，那么我将从我的少量积蓄中取出钱来支付，至少先付出第一笔2000马克。”爱因斯坦强调，主要的事情是弗伦德里希应当继续准备。“只管预备底片吧，不要因为钱的问题而浪费时间。”

As it turned out, there were enough private donations, mainly from the Krupp Foundation, to make the expedition possible. “You can imagine how happy I am that the external difficulties of your undertaking have now more or less been overcome,” Einstein wrote. He added a note of confidence about what would be found: “I have considered the theory from every angle, and I have every confidence in the thing.”<sup><a id="filepos596600"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1730127">37</a></sup>

后来证明，有足够的私人捐款（主要来自克虏伯基金会）使这次远征成为可能。“您事业上的外部困难现在或多或少得到了克服，您可以想象，我是多么快乐。”爱因斯坦写道。他对未来的发现充满信心。“我从每一个角度对理论做了考虑，对这个理论我充满信心。”

Freundlich and two colleagues left Berlin on July 19 for the Crimea, where they were joined by a group from the Córdoba observatory in Argentina. If all went well, they would have two minutes to make photographs that could be used to analyze whether the starlight was deflected by the sun’s gravity.

7月19日，弗伦德里希和两位同事离开柏林前往克里米亚，在那里又有一个阿根廷科尔多瓦天文台的小组加入进来。如果一切顺利，他们将有2分钟时间用来拍照，以分析星光是否因太阳引力而偏折。

</div></div>



<div class="layout">

All did not go well. Twenty days before the eclipse, Europe tumbled into World War I and Germany declared war on Russia. Freundlich and his German colleagues were captured by the Russian army, and their equipment was confiscated. Not surprisingly, they were unable to convince the Russian soldiers that, with all of their powerful cameras and location devices, they were mere astronomers planning to gaze at the stars in order to better understand the secrets of the universe.

<div class="right"><!--中文段-->

但事情进展并不顺利。在日食前20天，欧洲卷入了第一次世界大战，德国向俄国宣战。弗伦德里希及其德国同事被俄军俘虏，他们的装备也被没收。这些强大的照相机和定位设备自然无法使俄军相信，他们仅仅是一些天文学家，打算观察星星以更好地理解宇宙的秘密。

Even if they had been granted safe passage, it is likely that the observations would have failed. The skies were cloudy during the minutes of the eclipse, and an American group that was also in the region was unable to get any usable photographs.<sup><a id="filepos597850"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1730292">38</a></sup>

Yet the termination of the eclipse mission had a silver lining. Einstein’s <em>Entwurf</em> equations were not correct. The degree to which gravity would deflect light, according to Einstein’s theory at the time, was the same as that predicted by Newton’s emission theory of light. But, as Einstein would discover a year later, the correct prediction would end up being twice that. If Freundlich had succeeded in 1914, Einstein might have been publicly proven wrong.

虽然任务被迫终止，但事情还有一线希望。爱因斯坦的《纲要》方程并不正确。根据爱因斯坦当时的理论，引力使光的偏折与牛顿光发射理论的预言相一致。但正如爱因斯坦一年后发现的，正确的预言应当是它的两倍。倘若1914年弗伦德里希取得了成功，爱因斯坦的理论反倒可能被证伪了。

“我那位优秀的天文学家弗伦德里希，非但没有在俄国观测到曰食，现在倒要在那里遭受牢狱之苦，”爱因斯坦给埃伦菲斯特写信说，“我为他感到担忧。” 不过，担忧是没有必要的。几周以后，这位年轻的天文学家就在一次犯人交换中被释放。

Einstein, however, had other reasons to worry in August 1914. His marriage had just exploded. His masterpiece theory still needed work. And now his native country’s nationalism and militarism, traits that he had abhorred since childhood, had plunged it into a war that would cast him as a stranger in a strange land. In Germany, it would turn out, that was a dangerous position to be in.

然而，1914年8月，还有别的理由使爱因斯坦忧心忡忡。他的婚姻刚刚破裂。伟大理论仍然需要推进。他从小就厌恶的民族主义和军国主义正在把他的祖国拖入一场战争，他也因此成为陌生土地上的一个陌生人。事实证明，对他来说德国是一个危险的地方。

The chain reaction that pushed Europe into war in August 1914 inflamed the patriotic pride of the Prussians and, in an equal and opposite reaction, the visceral pacifism of Einstein, a man so gentle and averse to conflict that he even disliked playing chess. “Europe in its madness has now embarked on something incredibly preposterous,” he wrote Ehrenfest that month. “At such times one sees to what deplorable breed of brutes we belong.”<sup><a id="filepos599957"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1730604">40</a></sup>

将欧洲拖入1914年8月战争的链式反应激发了普鲁士人的爱国热情，也沿相反方向唤起了爱因斯坦内心深处的和平主义及其不服从的本能。他是如此温文友善，厌恶冲突，就连下棋都不喜欢。“疯狂的欧洲现在开始了难以置信的闹剧，”他当月写信给埃伦菲斯特说，“此时人们看得出来，人究竟属于哪一类可悲的畜生。”

Ever since he ran away from Germany as a schoolboy and was exposed to the gauzy internationalism of Jost Winteler in Aarau, Einstein had harbored sentiments that disposed him toward pacifism, one-world federalism, and socialism. But he had generally shunned public activism.

The irrationality of the war made Einstein believe that scientists in fact had a special duty to engage in public affairs. “We scientists in particular must foster internationalism,” he said. “Unfortunately, we have had to suffer serious disappointments even among scientists in this regard.”<sup><a id="filepos600941"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1730730">41</a></sup> He was especially appalled by the lockstep pro-war mentality of his three closest colleagues, the scientists who had lured him to Berlin: Fritz Haber, Walther Nernst, and Max Planck.<sup><a id="filepos601171"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1730891">42</a></sup>

Haber reorganized his institute to develop chemical weapons for Germany. He had already found a way to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen, which permitted the Germans to mass-produce explosives. He then turned his attention to making deadly chlorine gas, which, heavier than air, would flow down into the trenches and painfully asphyxiate soldiers by burning through their throats and lungs. In April 1915, modern chemical warfare was inaugurated when some five thousand French and Belgians met that deadly fate at Ypres, with Haber personally supervising the attack. (In an irony that may have been lost on the inventor of dynamite, who endowed the prize, Haber won the 1918 Nobel in chemistry for his process of synthesizing ammonia.)

哈伯将他的研究所进行了重组，从而为德国研制化学武器。他发现了由氮合成氨的方法，这使德国能够大规模生产炸药。接着他转而研制致命的氯气。氯气比空气重，可以飘入战壕，使士兵们痛苦地窒息，灼伤他们的喉咙和肺。1915年4月，现代化学战诞生了。哈伯亲自督战，大约5000名法国人和比利时人在伊普尔（Ypres）遭遇了噩运。（一个不大为人注意的讽刺是，诺贝尔奖是由炸药的发明人阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔设立的，哈伯因氨的合成法获得了1918年诺贝尔化学奖。）

His colleague and occasional academic rival Nernst, bespectacled and 50, had his wife inspect his style as he practiced marching and saluting in front of their house. Then he took his private car and showed up at the western front to be a volunteer driver. Upon his return to Berlin, he experimented with tear gas and other irritants that could be used as a humane way to flush the enemy out of the trenches, but the generals decided they preferred the lethal approach that Haber was taking, so Nernst became part of that effort.

The petition, published in October 1914, was titled “Appeal to the Cultured World” and became known as the “Manifesto of the 93,” after the number of intellectuals who endorsed it. With scant regard <a id="filepos604293"></a>for the truth, it denied that the German army had committed any attacks on civilians in Belgium and went on to proclaim that the war was necessary. “Were it not for German militarism, German culture would have been wiped off the face of the earth,” it asserted. “We shall wage this fight to the very end as a cultured nation, a nation that holds the legacy of Goethe, Beethoven, and Kant no less sacred than hearth and home.”<sup><a id="filepos604754"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1731552">46</a></sup>

It was no surprise that among the scientists who signed was the conservative Philipp Lenard, of photoelectric effect fame, who would later become a rabid anti-Semite and Einstein hater. What was distressing was that Haber, Nernst, and Planck also signed. As both citizens and scientists, they had a natural instinct to go along with the sentiments of others. Einstein, on the other hand, often displayed a natural inclination <em>not</em> to go along, which sometimes was an advantage both as a scientist and as a citizen.

A charismatic adventurer and occasional physician named Georg Friedrich Nicolai, who had been born Jewish (his original name was Lewinstein) and was a friend of both Elsa and her daughter Ilse, worked with Einstein to write a pacifist response. Their “Manifesto to Europeans” appealed for a culture that transcended nationalism and attacked the authors of the original manifesto. “They have spoken in a hostile spirit,” Einstein and Nicolai wrote. “Nationalist passions cannot excuse this attitude, which is unworthy of what the world has heretofore called culture.”

Einstein suggested to Nicolai that Max Planck, even though he had been one of the signers of the original manifesto, might also want to participate in their countermanifesto because of his “broad-mindedness and good will.” He also gave Zangger’s name as a possibility. But neither man, apparently, was willing to get involved. In an indication of the temper of the times, Einstein and Nicolai were able to garner only two other supporters.

Einstein also became an early member of the liberal and cautiously pacifist New Fatherland League, a club that pushed for an early peace and the establishment of a federal structure in Europe to avoid future conflicts. It published a pamphlet titled “The Creation of the United <a id="filepos607004"></a>States of Europe,” and it helped get pacifist literature into prisons and other places.

As they sat on a hotel terrace amid swarms of bees plundering the flowering vines, Einstein joked about the faculty meetings in Berlin where each of the professors would anguish over the topic “why are we Germans hated in the world” and then would “carefully steer clear of the truth.” Daringly, maybe even recklessly, Einstein openly said that he thought Germany could not be reformed and therefore hoped the allies would win, “which would smash the power of Prussia and the dynasty.”<sup><a id="filepos608250"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1732445">49</a></sup>

The following month, Einstein got into a bitter exchange with Paul Hertz, a noted mathematician in Göttingen who was, or had been, a friend. Hertz was an associate member of the New Fatherland League with Einstein, but he had shied away from becoming a full member when it became controversial. “This type of cautiousness, not standing up for one’s rights, is the cause of the entire wretched political situation,” Einstein berated. “You have that type of valiant mentality the ruling powers love so much in Germans.”

在接下来的一个月里，爱因斯坦与昔日的一位朋友，即哥廷根的著名数学家保罗·赫尔茨展开了激烈的笔战。和爱因斯坦一样，赫尔茨曾经是新祖国同盟的准会员，但是当这个组织变得有争议时，他却退出了该团体。“这种小心谨慎的态度，或者说不坚持自己权利的态度，正是造成整个政治困境的原因，”爱因斯坦斥责说，“您具有当权者深爱的德意志人身上的那种勇敢精神。”

“Had you devoted as much care to understanding people as to understanding science, you would not have written me an insulting letter,” Hertz replied. It was a telling point, and true. Einstein was better at fathoming physical equations than personal ones, as his family knew, and he admitted so in his apology. “You <em>must</em> forgive me, particularly since—as you yourself rightly say—I have <em>not</em> bestowed the same care to understanding people as to understanding science,” he wrote.<sup><a id="filepos609494"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1732725">50</a></sup>

“要是您对人的理解如同对科学的理解一样细心的话，您就不至于给我写这种侮辱人的信了。”赫尔茨回信说。这种说法很能说明问题，而且是准确的。在理解物理方程方面，爱因斯坦的确要比处理个人事务更胜一筹，他在致歉信中也这样承认。“正如您所言，我对人不像对科学那样细心地去理解，因此您必须原谅我。”他写道。

In November, Einstein published a three-page essay titled “My Opinion of the War” that skirted the border of what was permissible, even for a great scientist, to say in Germany. He speculated that there existed “a biologically determined feature of the male character” that <a id="filepos609891"></a>was one of the causes of wars. When the article was published by the Goethe League that month, a few passages were deleted for safety’s sake, including an attack on patriotism as potentially containing “the moral requisites of bestial hatred and mass murder.”<sup><a id="filepos610180"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1732966">51</a></sup>

The idea that war had a biological basis in male aggression was a topic Einstein also explored in a letter to his friend in Zurich, Heinrich Zangger. “What drives people to kill and maim each other so savagely?” Einstein asked. “I think it is the sexual character of the male that leads to such wild explosions.”

The early months of the war in 1915 made Einstein’s separation from Hans Albert and Eduard more difficult, both emotionally and logistically. They wanted him to come visit them in Zurich for Easter that year, and Hans Albert, who was just turning 11, wrote him two letters designed to pull at his heart: “I just think: At Easter you’re going to be here and we’ll have a Papa again.”

1915年年初，无论是从感情上讲还是从逻辑上讲，战争都使爱因斯坦与汉斯·阿尔伯特和爱德华的分离变得更加残酷。他们希望爱因斯坦能够在复活节期间到苏黎世来看他们。刚刚11岁的汉斯·阿尔伯特给他写了两封信，旨在牵动他的心弦。“我只是想：复活节时你会来这里，我们又能有爸爸了。”

The war made it impossible for him to come at Easter, but he responded to the postcards by promising Hans Albert that he would come in July for a hiking vacation in the Swiss Alps. “In the summer I will take a trip with just you alone for a fortnight or three weeks,” he wrote. “This will happen every year, and Tete [Eduard] may also come along when he is old enough for it.”

Perhaps they could do it by mail? “If you write me each time what you already know, I’ll give you a nice little problem to solve.” He sent along a toy for each of his sons, along with an admonition to brush their teeth well. “I do the same and am very happy now to have kept enough healthy teeth.”<sup><a id="filepos613342"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1733693">54</a></sup>

Einstein was convinced that Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> was turning the children against him. He suspected, probably correctly, that her hand was behind the postcards Hans Albert was sending, both the plaintive ones making him feel guilty for not being in Zurich and the sharper ones rejecting vacation hikes. “My fine boy had been alienated from me for a few years already by my wife, who has a vengeful disposition,” he complained to Zangger. “The postcard I received from little Albert had been inspired, if not downright dictated, by her.”

Einstein could see his sons, Besso advised in a formal letter he wrote after consulting with Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/>, but not in Berlin nor in the presence of Elsa’s family. It would be best to do it at “a good Swiss inn,” initially just with Hans Albert, where they could spend some time on their own free of all distractions.

But Einstein was more of a lone wolf. Unlike Planck, he did not want a coterie of collaborators or protégés, and he preferred to focus on what again had become his personal passion: the generalization of his theory of relativity.<sup><a id="filepos617920"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1735021">59</a></sup>

当爱因斯坦1914年春搬到柏林时，同事们以为他会组建一个研究所，招募助手来研究物理学中最迫切的问题——量子理论的含义。但他好似一匹孤独的狼，并不希望身边有一批合作者或学生，就像普朗克那样，而是希望聚精会神地研究他关心的东西——推广相对论。

So after his wife and sons left him for Zurich, Einstein moved out of their old apartment and rented one that was nearer to Elsa and the center of Berlin. It was a sparsely furnished bachelor’s refuge, but still rather spacious: it had seven rooms on the third floor of a new five-story building.<sup><a id="filepos618326"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1735269">60</a></sup>

所以在妻儿离开他前往苏黎世之后，爱因斯坦搬出了旧楼，在柏林市中心租了一间离爱尔莎更近的房子。屋里没有什么家具，是单身汉的庇护所，不过相当宽敞，它有七间屋子，位于一幢五层新楼的第三层。

爱因斯坦的书房里有一张木制的大写字台，上面凌乱地堆放着一叠叠论文和期刊。在这样一个僻静的住所，他可以随处走动，饿了就吃，困了就睡，有了兴致就开始工作。他正在孤独地做着努力。

Through the spring and summer of 1915, Einstein wrestled with his <em>Entwurf</em> theory, refining it and defending it against a variety of challenges. He began calling it “the general theory” rather than merely “a generalized theory” of relativity, but that did not mask its problems, which he kept trying to deflect.

整个1915年的春天和夏天，爱因斯坦都在冥思苦想他的《纲要》理论，试图对它进行改进和反驳各种挑战。这时，他开始称其为“广义理论”，而不仅仅是关于相对性的“一种推广的理论”，但这并不能掩盖他一直试图避开的问题。

He claimed that his equations had the greatest amount of covariance that was permissible given his hole argument and other strictures of physics, but he began to suspect that this was not correct. He also got into an exhausting debate with the Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita, who pointed out problems with his handling of the tensor calculus. And there was still the puzzle of the incorrect result the theory gave for the shift in Mercury’s orbit.

他称他的方程拥有空穴论证以及其他物理学限制所允许的最大协变性，但他开始怀疑这样说并不正确。他还与意大利数学家莱维-契维塔进行了一场令人精疲力竭的争论，莱维-契维塔通过张量运算指出了一些问题。另一个问题是，该理论给出的水星轨道运动结果并不正确。

At least his <em>Entwurf</em> theory still successfully explained—or so he thought through the summer of 1915—rotation as being a form of <em>relative</em> motion, that is, a motion that could be defined only relative to the positions and motions of other objects. His field equations, he thought, were invariant under the transformation to rotating coordinates.<sup><a id="filepos620047"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1735483">61</a></sup>

不过，爱因斯坦的《纲要》理论仍然成功地（至少他在1915年夏天是这么认为的）把旋转解释为一种相对运动，即一种只能相对于其他物体的位置和运动来定义的运动。他认为，他的场方程在变换到旋转坐标时能够保持不变。

Einstein was confident enough in his theory to show it off at a weeklong series of two-hour lectures, starting at the end of June 1915, at the University of Göttingen, which had become the preeminent center for the mathematical side of theoretical physics. Foremost among the geniuses there was David Hilbert, and Einstein was particularly eager—too eager, it would turn out—to explain all the intricacies of relativity to him.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦对自己的理论充满信心，以至于从1915年6月底开始，他在最著名的数学物理学中心——哥廷根大学举行了为时一周的一系列讲座，每次2小时。那里有多位天才人物，大卫·希尔伯特就是其中最著名的一位。爱因斯坦特别希望——后来表明是希望过度了——向他解释相对论的所有困难之处。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

The visit to Göttingen was a triumph. Einstein exulted to Zangger that he had “the pleasurable experience of convincing the mathematicians there thoroughly.” Of Hilbert, a fellow pacifist, he added, “I met him and became quite fond of him.” A few weeks later, after again reporting, “I was able to convince Hilbert of the general theory of relativity,” Einstein called him “a man of astonishing energy and independence.” In a letter to another physicist, Einstein was even more effusive: “In Göttingen I had the great pleasure of seeing that everything was understood down to the details. I am quite enchanted with Hilbert!”<sup><a id="filepos621346"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1735621">62</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


对哥廷根的访问硕果累累。爱因斯坦兴奋地对仓格尔说，他已经“完全说服了那里的数学家们，这真是快事一桩”。关于同样身为和平主义者的希尔伯特，爱因斯坦说：“我见到了他，对他非常欣赏。”几周以后，爱因斯坦又说，“我能够说服希尔伯特相信广义相对论”，并称他“有惊人的能量和独立性”。在给另一位物理学家的信中，爱因斯坦更加热情洋溢：“我极其欣喜地看到，在哥廷根，每一个细枝末节都得到了彻底的理解。我对希尔伯特狂喜不已！ ”

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos621445"></a>Hilbert was likewise enchanted with Einstein and his theory. So much so that he soon set out to see if he could beat Einstein to the goal of getting the field equations right. Within three months of his Göttingen lectures, Einstein was confronted with two distressing discoveries: that his <em>Entwurf</em> theory was indeed flawed, and that Hilbert was racing feverishly to come up with the correct formulations on his own.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

希尔伯特也同样被爱因斯坦和他的理论深深吸引，以至于没过多久，他决定看看自己是否能够先行得到正确的场方程。在三个月的哥廷根讲演期间，爱因斯坦有两项令人沮丧的发现：他的《纲要》理论的确有缺陷；希尔伯特本人正在热情高涨地试图自行得出正确的公式。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">

Einstein’s realization that his <em>Entwurf</em> theory was unraveling came from an accumulation of problems. But it culminated with two major blows in early October 1915.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦之所以认识到他的《纲要》理论正在分崩离析，乃是源于一系列问题的不断积聚，不过以1915年10月初的两次打击为最。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

The first was that, upon rechecking, Einstein found that the <em>Entwurf</em> equations did not actually account for rotation as he had thought.<sup><a id="filepos622321"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1735844">63</a></sup> He hoped to prove that rotation could be conceived of as just another form of relative motion, but it turned out that the <em>Entwurf</em> didn’t actually prove this. The <em>Entwurf</em> equations were not, as he had believed, covariant under a transformation that uniformly rotated the coordinate axes.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

首先，爱因斯坦在重新检查的时候发现，《纲要》方程并不像他曾经认为的那样能够真正解释旋转。 他希望证明，旋转只不过是另一种形式的相对运动，但事实表明，《纲要》并不能证明这一点。《纲要》方程并非像他所认为的那样，能够在匀速转动坐标轴的变换下保持协变。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Besso had warned him in a memo in 1913 that this seemed to be a problem. But Einstein had ignored him. Now, upon redoing his calculations, he was dismayed to see this pillar knocked away. “This is a blatant contradiction,” he lamented to the astronomer Freundlich.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

在1913年的一份备忘录中，贝索曾经警告过他这可能是一个问题，但爱因斯坦没有理会。现在，在重新做了计算之后，他沮丧地看到，这根柱子坍塌了。“这是一个明显的矛盾。”他向天文学家弗伦德里希悲叹道。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

He assumed that the same mistake also accounted for his theory’s inability to account fully for the shift in Mercury’s orbit. And he despaired that he would not be able to find the problem. “I do not believe I am able to find the mistake myself, for in this matter my mind is too set in a deep rut.”<sup><a id="filepos623392"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1736201">64</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


他认为正是因为同样的错误，他的理论才无法完全解释水星轨道的运动。他对自己是否能够发现问题感到绝望。“我不相信我自己能够把错误找出来，因为在这方面我的思想已经过于陈旧。” 

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

In addition, he realized that he had made a mistake in what was called his “uniqueness” argument: that the sets of conditions required by energy-momentum conservation and other physical restrictions uniquely led to the field equations in the <em>Entwurf.</em> He wrote Lorentz explaining in detail his previous “erroneous assertions.”<sup><a id="filepos623854"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1736446">65</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

不仅如此，爱因斯坦还意识到，他在所谓的“唯一性”论证上犯了一个错误，即根据能量动量守恒以及其他物理限制所要求的一套条件能够唯一地导出《纲要》中的场方程。他写信给洛伦兹，详细解释了他以前的“错误断言”。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Added to these problems were ones he already knew about: the <em>Entwurf</em> equations were not generally covariant, meaning that they did not really make all forms of accelerated and nonuniform motion relative, and they did not fully explain Mercury’s anomalous orbit. And now, as this edifice was crumbling, he could hear what seemed to be Hilbert’s footsteps gaining on him from Göttingen.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

除此之外还有他已经知道的那些问题：《纲要》方程不是广义协变的，这就意味着它并不能使一切形式的加速运动和非匀速运动真正成为相对的，而且也没有完全解释水星的反常轨道。如今大厦将倾，他似乎可以听见希尔伯特正从哥廷根向他步步紧逼。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

<a id="filepos624420"></a>Part of Einstein’s genius was his tenacity. He could cling to a set of ideas, even in the face of “apparent contradiction” (as he put it in his 1905 relativity paper). He also had a deep faith in his intuitive feel for the physical world. Working in a more solitary manner than most other scientists, he held true to his own instincts, despite the qualms of others.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

爱因斯坦的部分天才在于他的坚韧不拔。甚至在面对“显然的矛盾比如他1905年的相对论论文”时，他也能够固守自己的想法。他对自己关于物理世界的直觉感受深信不疑。其工作方式比大多数科学家更孤独，无论别人多么怀疑，他总是信守自己的本能。



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

But although he was tenacious, he was not mindlessly stubborn. When he finally decided his <em>Entwurf</em> approach was untenable, he was willing to abandon it abruptly. That is what he did in October 1915.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
然而尽管如此，他并非顽固不化。当他最终认定《纲要》理论站不住脚时，便断然将它抛弃。这正是他1915年10月所做的事情。

</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

To replace his doomed <em>Entwurf</em> theory, Einstein shifted his focus from the physical strategy, which emphasized his feel for basic principles of physics, and returned to a greater reliance on a mathematical strategy, which made use of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. It was an approach he had used in his Zurich notebooks and then abandoned, but on returning to it he found that it could provide a way to generate generally covariant gravitational field equations. “Einstein’s reversal,” writes John Norton, “parted the waters and led him from bondage into the promised land of general relativity.”<sup><a id="filepos625770"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1738769">66</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


为了取代注定要失败的《纲要》理论，爱因斯坦开始把目光由物理方案（强调他对于物理学基本原理的感受）转向更多地依靠数学方案（运用黎曼和里奇张量）。他曾经在苏黎世笔记本中使用过这种方法，后来抛弃了它，但此时发现由它可以产生广义协变的引力场方程。诺顿写道：“爱因斯坦的逆转分开了水面，引领他由奴役走入了广义相对论的应许之地。 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Of course, as always, his approach remained a mix of both strategies. To pursue a revitalized mathematical strategy, he had to revise the physical postulates that were the foundation for his <em>Entwurf</em> theory. “This was exactly the sort of convergence of physical and mathematical considerations that eluded Einstein in the Zurich notebook and in his work on the <em>Entwurf</em> theory,” write Michel Janssen and Jürgen Renn.<sup><a id="filepos626323"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1738907">67</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

当然，和往常一样，他仍然两种方案并用。为了采用重新焕发生机的数学方案，他不得不修改作为《纲要》理论基础的物理学假定。“这恰恰是爱因斯坦在苏黎世笔记本和《纲要》理论中没有实现的那种物理思考与数学思考的融合。”扬森和雷恩写道。 



</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Thus he returned to the tensor analysis that he had used in Zurich, with its greater emphasis on the mathematical goal of finding equations that were generally covariant. “Once every last bit of confidence in the earlier theories had given way,” he told a friend, “I saw clearly that it was only through general covariance theory, i.e., with Riemann’s covariant, that a satisfactory solution could be found.”<sup><a id="filepos626865"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1740956">68</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>
于是他转向了曾经在苏黎世使用过的张量分析，更强调找到广义协变方程这一数学目标。“对之前理论的信任完全消失之后，”他对一位朋友说，“我清楚地看到，只有通过广义协变理论，也就是与黎曼协变量结合，才可能找到令人满意的解答。” 


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

The result was an exhausting, four-week frenzy during which Einstein wrestled with a succession of tensors, equations, corrections, and updates that he rushed to the Prussian Academy in a flurry of four Thursday lectures. It climaxed, with the triumphant revision of Newton’s universe, at the end of November 1915.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

结果，爱因斯坦开始了四个星期不知疲倦的疯狂工作。在此期间，他摆弄着一大堆张量和方程，不断进行修正和翻新。一连四个周四，他在普鲁士科学院做了四次演讲。1915年11月底工作达到了高潮，牛顿的宇宙成功得以修正。

Every week, the fifty or so members of the Prussian Academy gathered <a id="filepos627410"></a>in the grand hall of the Prussian State Library in the heart of Berlin to address each other as “Your Excellency” and listen to fellow members pour forth their wisdom. Einstein’s series of four lectures had been scheduled weeks earlier, but until they began—and even after they had begun—he was still working furiously on his revised theory.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

每一周，50多位普鲁士科学院院士都会聚集在柏林市中心的普鲁士国家图书馆大礼堂，听取同行们的成果和见解。爱因斯坦的四次讲演几周前就安排好了，但直到讲演开始，甚至在开始之后，他还在紧张地忙于修正理论。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

The first was delivered on November 4. “For the last four years,” he began, “I have tried to establish a general theory of relativity on the assumption of the relativity even of non-uniform motion.” Referring to his discarded <em>Entwurf</em> theory, he said he “actually believed I had discovered the only law of gravitation” that conformed to physical realities.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

第一次讲演是在1915年11月4日。他开门见山地说：“在过去四年里，我试图基于非匀速运动的相对性假设建立一门广义相对论。”在谈到被抛弃的《纲要》理论时，他说相信自己已经发现了符合物理实在的唯一的引力定律。


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

But then, with great candor, he detailed all of the problems that theory had encountered. “For that reason, I completely lost trust in the field equations” that he had been defending for more than two years. Instead, he said, he had now returned to the approach that he and his mathematical caddy, Marcel Grossmann, had been using in 1912. “Thus I went back to the requirement of a more general covariance of the field equations, which I had left only with a heavy heart when I worked together with my friend Grossmann. In fact, we had then already come quite close to the solution.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


但是接着，他坦陈了这一理论碰到的所有问题。“由于这个原因，我对场方程完全失去了信心”，他已经为此努力过两年多。现在，他已经转到了他和格罗斯曼1912年使用的方案。“于是我回到了场方程更加广义的协变性要求。当我与朋友格罗斯曼合作时，我曾经心情沉重地放弃了它。事实上，我们那时已经与答案相当接近。” 
</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">
<p>

Einstein reached back to the Riemann and Ricci tensors that Grossmann had introduced him to in 1912. “Hardly anyone who truly understands it can resist the charm of this theory,” he lectured. “It signifies a real triumph of the method of the calculus founded by Gauss, Riemann, Christoffel, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.”<sup><a id="filepos629310"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1741122">69</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>


爱因斯坦回到了格罗斯曼1912年向他介绍的黎曼张量和里奇张量。“任何真正理解它的人都很难抗拒这种理论的魅力，”他说，“它标志着由高斯、黎曼、克里斯托菲、里奇和莱维-契维塔等人创立的演算方法的真正胜利。”


</p>
</div></div>



<div class="layout">
<div class="left">

This method got him much closer to the correct solution, but his equations on November 4 were still not generally covariant. That would take another three weeks.
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

这一方法使他与正确结果更近了，但他11月4日的方程仍然不是广义协变的。要达到这一步还需要三个星期。

Einstein was in the throes of one of the most concentrated frenzies of scientific creativity in history. He was working, he said, “horrendously intensely.”<sup><a id="filepos629799"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1741336">70</a></sup> In the midst of this ordeal, he was also still dealing with the personal crisis within his family.

</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

此时，爱因斯坦正处于历史上罕见的科学创造力集中爆发的阵痛中。他说自己正在“极为紧张”地工作。 在此期间，他不仅要经受这种折磨，还要处理家庭内部的危机。妻子和贝索写来的信强调了他需要承担的经济义务，讨论了与两个儿子联系的方式。

Einstein also took time off from furiously revising his equations to engage in an awkward fandango with his erstwhile friend and competitor David Hilbert, who was racing him to find the equations of general relativity. Einstein had been informed that the Göttingen mathematician had figured out the flaws in the <em>Entwurf</em> equations. Worried about being scooped, he wrote Hilbert a letter saying that he himself had discovered the flaws four weeks earlier, and he sent along a copy of his November 4 lecture. “I am curious whether you will take kindly to this new solution,” Einstein asked with a touch of defensiveness.<sup><a id="filepos631830"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1741712">72</a></sup>

爱因斯坦在忙于修改方程的同时，还与他昔日的朋友兼竞争者希尔伯特进行了一场尴尬的角力。此时希尔伯特正在寻找广义相对论方程，与他竞争。有人告诉爱因斯坦，这位哥廷根数学家已经发现了《纲要》方程的错误。由于担心被抢先，爱因斯坦给希尔伯特写了一封信，说他四周之前就已经发现了这些错误，并寄去了11月4日讲演的副本。“我很想知道，您是否喜欢这种新的解决办法。”爱因斯坦带着防御的口气问道。

Hilbert was not only a better pure mathematician than Einstein, he also had the advantage of not being as good a physicist. He did not get all wrapped up, the way Einstein did, in making sure that any new theory conformed to Newton’s old one in a weak static field or that it obeyed the laws of causality. Instead of a dual math-and-physics strategy, Hilbert pursued mainly a math strategy, focusing on finding the equations that were covariant. “Hilbert liked to joke that physics was too complicated to be left to the physicists,” notes Dennis Overbye.<sup><a id="filepos632506"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1741873">73</a></sup>

希尔伯特虽然在数学方面比爱因斯坦更好，但却不是同样好的物理学家。他并没有像爱因斯坦那样最终确保任何新理论在静态弱场情况下都能符合牛顿的旧理论，或者服从因果律。希尔伯特没有采用数学-物理双重方案，而主要采用了力图找到协变方程的数学方案。“希尔伯特喜欢开玩笑说，物理学太复杂了，不能只留给物理学家去研究。”奥弗比说。

Einstein presented his second paper the following Thursday, November 11. In it, he used the Ricci tensor and imposed new coordinate conditions that allowed the equations thus to be generally covariant. As it turned out, that did not greatly improve matters. Einstein was still close to the final answer, but making little headway.<sup><a id="filepos632940"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1742007">74</a></sup>

接下来的那个星期四，即11月11日，爱因斯坦提交了第二篇论文。他在其中使用了里奇张量，指定了新的坐标条件，使得方程具有广义协变性。事实表明，问题并没有得到根本解决。爱因斯坦距离最终答案虽然只有一步之遥，却始终迈不过去。

Once again, he sent the paper off to Hilbert. “If my present modification (which does not change the equations) is legitimate, then gravitation <a id="filepos633189"></a>must play a fundamental role in the composition of matter,” Einstein said. “My own curiosity is interfering with my work!”<sup><a id="filepos633341"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1742268">75</a></sup>

他再次把论文寄给了希尔伯特。“倘若我目前的修改（并没有改变方程）是合理的，那么在物质构成方面，引力必定起着基础性的作用，”爱因斯坦说，“好奇心使我的工作更加困难了！”

The reply that Hilbert sent the next day must have unnerved Einstein. He said he was about ready to oblige with “an axiomatic solution to your great problem.” He had planned to hold off discussing it until he explored the physical ramifications further. “But since you are so interested, I would like to lay out my theory in very complete detail this coming Tuesday,” which was November 16.

希尔伯特第二天的回信必定使爱因斯坦坐立不安。他说他正准备就“您提出的大问题给出一种公理化的解决方案”。希尔伯特打算暂不讨论，直到对这项物理研究做出实质性的推进。“但是既然您如此有兴趣，我愿意在下星期二（本月16日）把我的理论详详细细阐述一遍。”

He invited Einstein to come to Göttingen and have the dubious pleasure of personally hearing him lay out the answer. The meeting would begin at 6 p.m., and Hilbert helpfully provided Einstein with the arrival times of the two afternoon trains from Berlin. “My wife and I would be very pleased if you stayed with us.”

他邀请爱因斯坦到哥廷根，亲自听他给出答案。会面将在下午6点开始，希尔伯特特意告知了从柏林到哥廷根的两列火车的到达时间。“如果您能和我们在一起，我的妻子和我将会非常高兴。”

Then, after signing his name, Hilbert felt compelled to add what must surely have been a tantalizing and disconcerting postscript. “As far as I understand your new paper, the solution given by you is entirely different from mine.”

Einstein wrote four letters on November 15, a Monday, that give a glimpse into why he was suffering stomach pains. To his son Hans Albert, he suggested that he would like to travel to Switzerland around Christmas and New Year’s to visit him. “Maybe it would be better if we were alone somewhere,” such as at a secluded inn, he suggested to his son. “What do you think?”

11月15日，星期一，爱因斯坦一连写了四封信，也许我们可以从中感到他为何会胃痛。在给儿子汉斯·阿尔伯特的信中他说，他打算在圣诞节和新年前后去瑞士看他。“也许我们两个人单独到某个地方更好些，”比如一个隐蔽的小酒馆，他向儿子建议，“你觉得如何？”

</div></div>



<div class="layout">

He also wrote his estranged wife a conciliatory letter that thanked her for her willingness not “to undermine my relations with the boys.” And he reported to their mutual friend Zangger, “I have modified the theory of gravity, having realized that my earlier proofs had a gap ...I shall be glad to come to Switzerland at the turn of the year in order to see my dear boy.”<sup><a id="filepos635456"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1742430">76</a></sup>

他还给妻子写了一封安抚的信，感谢她不打算“破坏我与孩子们的关系”。他又给他们共同的朋友仓格尔写信说：“我已经修改了引力理论，意识到我以前的证明有一处脱漏……我很高兴在年底去瑞士看看我可爱的儿子。”

Finally, he replied to Hilbert and declined his invitation to visit Göttingen the next day. His letter did not hide his anxiety: “Your analysis interests me tremendously . . . The hints you gave in your messages awaken the greatest of expectations. Nevertheless, I must refrain from traveling to Göttingen for the moment ...I am tired out and plagued by stomach pains . . . If possible, please send me a correction proof of your study to mitigate my impatience.”<sup><a id="filepos636044"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1742780">77</a></sup>
</p>
</div>
<div class="right"><!--中文段-->
<p>

最后，他给希尔伯特写了回信，谢绝了第二天访问哥廷根的邀请。信件没有掩饰他的焦虑：“我对您的分析非常感兴趣……您在明信片上的暗示，让人满怀期待。但眼下我没法去哥廷根……我疲惫极了，而且还受到胃痛的折磨……如有可能，请寄给我一本您论文的校样，以便缓解我的不耐。”

<a id="filepos636143"></a>Fortunately for Einstein, his anxiety was partly alleviated that week by a joyous discovery. Even though he knew his equations were not in final form, he decided to see whether the new approach he was taking would yield the correct results for what was known about the shift in Mercury’s orbit. Because he and Besso had done the calculations once before (and gotten a disappointing result), it did not take him long to redo the calculations using his revised theory.

幸运的是，那一周爱因斯坦的焦虑因为一个惊喜的发现而有所缓解。虽然他知道他的方程不是最终形式，但他还是决定看看由这种新方案是否能够产生正确的水星轨道运动结果。由于他和贝索此前已经做过计算（得到了一个令人失望的结果）所以用修正后的理论重新计算并未用去太多时间。

He was so thrilled he had heart palpitations, as if “something had snapped” inside. “I was beside myself with joyous excitement,” he told Ehrenfest. To another physicist he exulted: “The results of Mercury’s perihelion movement fills me with great satisfaction.

事实上，他在11月的第二次讲演中宣布的解答是正确的：每世纪43弧秒。 “我相信，这一发现是迄今为止爱因斯坦科学生活乃至整个一生中最强烈的情感体验。”派斯后来说。他激动万分，仿佛“心都要跳出来了”。“我简直高兴得要死，”他对埃伦菲斯特说。他还对另一位物理学家欢呼说：“我对水星近日点运动的结论是极其满意的。在这方面，天文学学究式的精确性对我们的帮助多么大啊，以前我还经常偷偷取笑这种精确性呢！”

In the same lecture, he also reported on another calculation he had made. When he first began formulating general relativity eight years earlier, he had said that one implication was that gravity would bend light. He had previously figured that the bending of light by the gravitational field next to the sun would be approximately 0.83 arc-second, which corresponded to what would be predicted by Newton’s theory when light was treated as if a particle. But now, using his newly revised theory, Einstein calculated that the bending of light by gravity would be twice as great, because of the effect produced by the curvature of spacetime. Therefore, the sun’s gravity would bend a beam by about 1.7 arc-seconds, he now predicted. It was a prediction that would have to wait for the next suitable eclipse, more than three years away, to be tested.

在同一场讲演中，他还报告了他的另一次计算。当他八年前第一次开始表述广义相对论时，他曾说，一个结论是引力会使光线弯曲。他曾经计算出，太阳附近的引力场将使光线大约偏折0.83弧秒，这与把光视作粒子的牛顿理论的预言相符。但是现在，利用修正后的新理论，考虑到时空弯曲所产生的效应，爱因斯坦计算出的光线弯曲是它的两倍。因此，他现在预言太阳引力将使光线大约偏折1.7弧秒。这一预言必须等到三年多之后再次发生合适的日食才能被检验。

The difficulty was not in finding generally covariant equations ...for this is easily achieved with Riemann’s tensor . . . Three years ago with my friend Grossmann I had already taken into consideration the only covariant equations, which have now been shown to be the correct ones. We had distanced ourselves from it, reluctantly, because it seemed to me that the physical discussion yielded an incongruity with Newton’s law.

Hilbert responded kindly and quite generously the following day, claiming no priority for himself. “Cordial congratulations on conquering perihelion motion,” he wrote. “If I could calculate as rapidly as you, in my equations the electron would have to capitulate and the hydrogen atom would have to produce its note of apology about why it does not radiate.”<sup><a id="filepos640192"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1743586">81</a></sup>

第二天，希尔伯特友好地回了信，慷慨大度地称自己并没有优先权。“衷心祝贺您拿下了近日点运动，”他写道，“如果我能像您那样算得那么快，那么在我的公式中，电子就不得不束手就擒，氢原子也会给我写一张致歉条，说明为什么它不发出辐射。”

It is not clear how carefully Einstein read the paper that Hilbert sent him or what in it, if anything, affected his thinking as he busily prepared his climactic fourth lecture at the Prussian Academy. Whatever the case, the calculations he had done the week earlier, on Mercury and on light deflection, helped him realize that he could avoid the constraints and coordinate conditions he had been imposing on his gravitational field equations. And thus he produced in time for his final lecture—“The Field Equations of Gravitation,” on November 25, 1915—a set of covariant equations that capped his general theory of relativity.

At last Einstein had equations that were truly covariant and thus a theory that incorporated, at least to his satisfaction, all forms of motion, whether it be inertial, accelerated, rotational, or arbitrary. As he proclaimed in the formal presentation of his theory that he published the following March in the <em>Annalen der Physik,</em> “The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equations that hold true for all systems of coordinates, that is they are covariant with respect to any substitutions whatever.”<sup><a id="filepos644140"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1744657">85</a></sup>

最终，爱因斯坦得到了真正协变的方程，因为这种理论（至少令他满意地）包含了所有运动形式，无论是惯性运动、加速运动、旋转运动还是任意运动。在当年3月的《物理学纪事》中，他在给出理论的正式表述时宣称：“自然的一般定律是由那些对一切坐标系都有效的方程来表示的，也就是说，它们无论对于哪种变换都是协变的。”

So who actually deserves the primary credit for the final mathematical equations? The Einstein-Hilbert priority issue has generated a small but intense historical debate, some of which seems at times to be driven by passions that go beyond mere scientific curiosity. Hilbert presented a version of his equations in his talk on November 16 and a paper that he dated November 20, before Einstein presented his final equations on November 25. However, a team of Einstein scholars in 1997 found a set of proof pages of Hilbert’s article, on which Hilbert had made revisions that he then sent back to the publisher on December 16. In the original version, Hilbert’s equations differed in a small but important way from Einstein’s final version of the November 25 lecture. They were not actually generally covariant, and he did not include a step that involved contracting the Ricci tensor and putting the resulting trace term, the Ricci scalar, into the equation. Einstein did this in his November 25 lecture. Apparently, Hilbert made a correction in the revised version of his article to match Einstein’s version. His revisions, quite generously, also added the phrase “first introduced by Einstein” when he referred to the gravitational potentials.

那么，最终的数学方程应当主要归功于谁呢？关于爱因斯坦和希尔伯特的优先权问题，史学家们已经在小范围里进行了激烈争论，其驱动力有时似乎超出了纯科学的范围。在11月16日的谈话，以及一篇日期为11月20日的论文中，希尔伯特提出了他的方程，这些都早于爱因斯坦11月25日提出最终的方程。但是1997年，一些爱因斯坦学者发现了希尔伯特文章的一些校样，它们显示希尔伯特做了一些改动，之后于12月16日寄回了出版社。虽然在最初的版本中，希尔伯特的方程与爱因斯坦在11月25日讲演的最终版本相差不多，但有一个关键的区别。它们不是真正广义协变的，而且希尔伯特没有把里奇张量收缩，并把得到的“迹”即里奇标量放入方程。而爱因斯坦在11月25日的讲演中却这样做了。显然，希尔伯特在文章的修订版中做了改正，以符合爱因斯坦的版本。在谈到引力势时，他非常有雅量地加上了“首先由爱因斯坦引入”这一短语。

It is fair to say that both men—to some extent independently but each also with knowledge of what the other was doing—derived by November 1915 mathematical equations that gave formal expression to the general theory.

平心而论，两人在1915年11月都导出了（在某种程度上是独立的，但也都知道对方在做什么）正式的广义相对论数学方程。根据希尔伯特对自己校样的修改来看，似乎是爱因斯坦首先发表了这些方程的最终版本。而且甚至连希尔伯特本人最后都把荣誉和优先权归于爱因斯坦。

Even the physicist Kip Thorne, one of those who give Hilbert credit for producing the correct field equations, nonetheless says that Einstein deserves credit for the theory underlying the equations. “Hilbert carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with Einstein, but Einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded these steps,” Thorne notes. “Without Einstein, the general relativistic laws of gravity might not have been discovered until several decades later.”<sup><a id="filepos648206"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1745117">87</a></sup>

无论如何，这些方程使爱因斯坦的理论获得了形式化表述。那年夏天，他在哥廷根见到希尔伯特时就向其解释过这种理论。甚至连主张把正确的场方程归于希尔伯特的物理学家索恩都说，方程背后的理论应当归功于爱因斯坦。“希尔伯特几乎与爱因斯坦同时独立地发现了最后几个数学步骤，但这些步骤之前的几乎任何东西都要归功于爱因斯坦，”索恩说：“没有爱因斯坦，广义相对论的引力定律也许要再过数十年才能被发现。”

Hilbert, graciously, felt the same way. As he stated clearly in the final published version of his paper, “The differential equations of gravitation that result are, as it seems to me, in agreement with the magnificent theory of general relativity established by Einstein.” Henceforth he would always acknowledge (thus undermining those who would use him to diminish Einstein) that Einstein was the sole author of the theory of relativity.<sup><a id="filepos648761"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1745250">88</a></sup> “Every boy in the streets of Göttingen understands more about four-dimensional geometry than Einstein,” he reportedly said. “Yet, in spite of that, Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians.”<sup><a id="filepos649036"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1746868">89</a></sup>

心胸宽广的希尔伯特也是这样认为的。他在论文最终的发表版本中明确指出：“在我看来，结果得出的引力微分方程与爱因斯坦建立的宏伟的广义相对论相一致。”此后他总是承认（这会使那些用他来贬低爱因斯坦的人失望的），爱因斯坦是相对论唯一的创造者。 “关于四维几何，哥廷根大街上的每一个孩子都比爱因斯坦知道更多，”据说他曾这样说，“然而尽管如此，做出这项工作的是爱因斯坦，而不是数学家们。”

Indeed, Einstein and Hilbert were soon friendly again. Hilbert wrote in December, just weeks after their dash for the field equations was finished, to say that with his support Einstein had been elected to the Göttingen Academy. After expressing his thanks, Einstein added, “I feel compelled to say something else to you.” He explained:

事实上，爱因斯坦与希尔伯特不久就重归于好。在他们就场方程发生冲撞几周以后，希尔伯特11月写信说，在他的支持下，爱因斯坦当选为哥廷根科学院院士。在表达谢意之后，爱因斯坦说：“我感到不得不对你说一些别的事情。”他解释说：

There has been a certain ill-feeling between us, the cause of which I do not want to analyze. I have struggled against the feeling of bitterness attached to it, with complete success. I think of you again with unmixed geniality and ask you to try to do the same with me. It is a shame when two real fellows who have extricated themselves somewhat from this shabby world do not afford each other mutual pleasure.<sup><a id="filepos649985"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1747194">90</a></sup>

你我之间曾经出现过某种敌意，其原因我并不想加以分析。我同它所带来的痛苦情绪进行了一番搏斗，终于彻底战胜了它。我又一次完全以亲切友好之情想起了您，希望您也能这样对我。如果两个多多少少从这个破败的世界中解脱出来的真正伙伴没有彼此给对方带来快乐，那真是一种羞耻。

Einstein, at age 36, had produced one of history’s most imaginative and dramatic revisions of our concepts about the universe. The general theory of relativity was not merely the interpretation of some experimental data or the discovery of a more accurate set of laws. It was a whole new way of regarding reality.

Newton had bequeathed to Einstein a universe in which time had an absolute existence that tick-tocked along independent of objects and observers, and in which space likewise had an absolute existence. Gravity was thought to be a force that masses exerted on one another rather mysteriously across empty space. Within this framework, objects obeyed mechanical laws that had proved remarkably accurate—almost perfect—in explaining everything from the orbits of the planets, to the diffusion of gases, to the jiggling of molecules, to the propagation of sound (though not light) waves.

在牛顿留给爱因斯坦的宇宙中，时间有一种绝对的存在性，它独立于物体和观察者而均匀流逝，空间也有类似的绝对存在性。引力被认为是物体神秘地穿过空虚的空间彼此施加一种力。在这一框架中，物体服从力学定律。从行星轨道、气体扩散、分子抖动到声波（虽然不是光波）传播，它们在解释万物方面惊人地准确，堪称完美。

With his special theory of relativity, Einstein had shown that space and time did not have independent existences, but instead formed a fabric of spacetime. Now, with his general version of the theory, this fabric of spacetime became not merely a container for objects and events. Instead, it had its own dynamics that were determined by, and in turn helped to determine, the motion of objects within it—just as the fabric of a trampoline will curve and ripple as a bowling ball and some billiard balls roll across it, and in turn the dynamic curving and rippling of the trampoline fabric will determine the path of the rolling balls and cause the billiard balls to move toward the bowling ball.

通过狭义相对论，爱因斯坦表明，空间和时间并不具有绝对的存在性，而是构成了一种时空结构。而通过广义相对论，这种时空结构不仅成了物体和事件的一种容器，而且也有自己的动力学，既被其中物体的运动所确定，也可以反过来确定它，就像弹子球和保龄球滚过时，蹦床的结构会发生弯曲一样，反过来，这种蹦床结构的弯曲又会规定滚过的球的路径，使弹子球朝着保龄球运动。

The curving and rippling fabric of spacetime explained gravity, its equivalence to acceleration, and, Einstein asserted, the general relativity of all forms of motion.<sup><a id="filepos652774"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1747566">92</a></sup> In the opinion of Paul Dirac, the Nobel laureate pioneer of quantum mechanics, it was “probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made.” Another of the great giants of twentieth-century physics, Max Born, called it “the greatest feat of <a id="filepos653077"></a>human thinking about nature, the most amazing combination of philosophical penetration, physical intuition and mathematical skill.”<sup><a id="filepos653226"></a><a href="Einstein_split_035.html#filepos1748732">93</a></sup>

这种弯曲的时空结构解释了引力，引力与加速等效，以及关于一切形式的运动的广义相对论。在量子力学的先驱－诺贝尔奖获得者保罗&middot;狄拉克看来，它“也许是迄今为止最伟大的科学发现”。20世纪物理学的另一们巨人玻恩则称它为“人思考自然的最伟大成就，哲学洞察、物理直觉和数学技巧最令人惊叹的结合。”

<p>The entire process had exhausted Einstein but left him elated. His marriage had collapsed and war was ravaging Europe, but Einstein was as happy as he would ever be. “My boldest dreams have now come true,” he exulted to Besso. “<em>General</em> covariance.

整个过程使爱因斯坦精疲力竭，但也使他兴奋异常。虽然婚姻已经破裂，战争正在蹂躏欧洲，但他仍然感到幸福。“我最大胆的梦想已成为现实，”他高兴地对贝索说，“广义协变性，水星近日点运动极为精确。”他对自己说“心满意足，但累得要死。”
