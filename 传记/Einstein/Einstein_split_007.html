<p><strong>M<small>ICHELE</small> A<small>NGELO</small> B<small>ESSO</small></strong> (1873–1955). Einstein’s closest friend. An engaging but unfocused engineer, he met Einstein in Zurich, then followed him to work at the Bern patent office. Served as a sounding board for the 1905 special relativity paper. Married Anna Winteler, sister of Einstein’s first girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>N<small>IELS</small> B<small>OHR</small></strong> (1885–1962). Danish pioneer of quantum theory. At Solvay conferences and subsequent intellectual trysts, he parried Einstein’s enthusiastic challenges to his Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>M<small>AX</small> B<small>ORN</small></strong> (1882–1970). German physicist and mathematician. Engaged in a brilliant, intimate correspondence with Einstein for forty years. Tried to convince Einstein to be comfortable with quantum mechanics; his wife, Hedwig, challenged Einstein on personal issues.</p>
<p><strong>H<small>ELEN</small> D<small>UKAS</small></strong> (1896–1982). Einstein’s loyal secretary, Cerberus-like guard, and housemate from 1928 until his death, and after that protector of his legacy and papers.</p>
<p><strong>A<small>RTHUR</small> S<small>TANLEY</small> E<small>DDINGTON</small></strong> (1882–1944). British astrophysicist and champion of relativity whose 1919 eclipse observations dramatically confirmed Einstein’s prediction of how much gravity bends light.</p>
<p><strong>P<small>AUL</small> E<small>HRENFEST</small></strong> (1880–1933). Austrian-born physicist, intense and insecure, who bonded with Einstein on a visit to Prague in 1912 and became a professor in Leiden, where he frequently hosted Einstein.</p>
<p><strong>E<small>DUARD</small> E<small>INSTEIN</small></strong> (1910–1965). Second son of Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> and Einstein. Smart and artistic, he obsessed about Freud and hoped to be a psychiatrist, but he succumbed to his own schizophrenic demons in his twenties and was institutionalized in Switzerland for much of the rest of his life.</p>
<p><strong>E<small>LSA</small> E<small>INSTEIN</small></strong> (1876–1936). Einstein’s first cousin, second wife. Mother of Margot and Ilse Einstein from her first marriage to textile merchant Max Löwenthal. She and her daughters reverted to her maiden name, Einstein, after her 1908 divorce. Married Einstein in 1919. Smarter than she pretended to be, she knew how to handle him.</p>
<p><a></a><strong>H<small>ANS</small> A<small>LBERT</small> E<small>INSTEIN</small></strong> (1904–1973). First son of Mileva Mari<img alt="Image" src="images/00005.jpg"/> and Einstein, a difficult role that he handled with grace. Studied engineering at Zurich Polytechnic. Married Frieda Knecht (1895–1958) in 1927. They had two sons, Bernard (1930–) and Klaus (1932–1938), and an adopted daughter, Evelyn (1941–). Moved to the United States in 1938 and eventually became a professor of hydraulic engineering at Berkeley. After Frieda’s death, married Elizabeth Roboz (1904–1995) in 1959. Bernard has five children, the only known great-grandchildren of Albert Einstein.</p>
<p><strong>H<small>ERMANN</small> E<small>INSTEIN</small></strong> (1847–1902). Einstein’s father, from a Jewish family from rural Swabia. With his brother Jakob, he ran electrical companies in Munich and then Italy, but not very successfully.</p>
