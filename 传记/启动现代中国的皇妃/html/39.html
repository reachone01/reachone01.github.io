<a href="../pic/38.png" title="../pic/38.png"><img src="../pic/38.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  39. Guangxu detested his empress, whom Cixi (centre, in cape) had picked. Empress Longyu (second from left 隆裕（1868—1913），名静芬，小名喜子), was stooped and looked a pitiful figure in the court. Far left: Cui, the eunuch; and far right: Louisa Pierson.</p>
<a href="../pic/39.png" title="../pic/39.png"><img src="../pic/39.png" /></a>

<a href="../pic/48.png" title="../pic/48.png"><img src="../pic/48.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓ 49. Convicts in the cangues. The legal reforms started by Cixi abolished medieval forms of punishment like this – and 'death by a thousand cuts'.</p>

<p> ↓  50. Putting a flower in her Manchu-style coiffure. Cixi took great care of her appearance.

<a href="../pic/50.png" title="../pic/50.png"><img src="../pic/50.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  51. The only photo in which Cixi is smiling. She actually liked laughing, but would switch off her smiles and assume a serious air when she went to work – or faced the camera.</p>
<a href="../pic/51.png" title="../pic/51.png"><img src="../pic/51.png" /></a>

<p> ↓  55. The courtyard outside the dining-room of the Congers. In the summer, the open-air court and the whole building were covered by a giant 'mosquito net', made of reed matting by ingenious eunuchs.

<p> ↓  56. Cixi among four young, good-looking eunuchs, Lady-in-waiting Der Ling（德龄） to the side. Such physical intimacy was bound to lead to sexual desires in her younger years. In fact she fell in love with a eunuch, An Dehai（安德海）, when she was in her early thirties. He was beheaded in 1869, and she suffered a breakdown. </p>
<a href="../pic/56.png" title="../pic/56.png"><img src="../pic/56.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  57. On her deathbed in 1908, Cixi made her two-year-old great-nephew, Puyi (standing), the next emperor, and his father, Zaifeng (seated holding Puyi's brother), the Regent. </p>
<a href="../pic/57.png" title="../pic/57.png"><img src="../pic/57.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  58. Sun Yat-sen (centre), known as the 'Father' of Republican China, had tried repeatedly to overthrow the Manchu dynasty by military means. </p>
<a href="../pic/58.png" title="../pic/58.png"><img src="../pic/58.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  59. Cixi's funeral. Brooke Astor, American philanthropist, was a child in Beijing and watched the procession with her family from the city wall: 'All day it passed beneath us through the gate. There were Buddhist and Taoist priests in white robes and Buddhist lamas in yellow with red sashes. There were endless bands of eunuchs dressed in white, who tossed paper money in the air (for the Empress's use on her way to heaven)…There were twenty-four white camels, with yellow brocade tents on their backs … and a whole company of white ponies … there were papier-mâché replicas of all the Empress's palaces … All this passed accompanied by the cries of the mourners, who tore their hair and beat their chests to the clashing of cymbals.' The colossal palanquin was covered with yellow brocade embroidered with phoenixes. When it passed by, all Westerners rose and took off their hats. </p>
<a href="../pic/59.png" title="../pic/59.png"><img src="../pic/59.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  60. The Eastern Mausoleums of the Qing monarchs outside Beijing, where Cixi was buried with her husband and her son. In 1928, an unruly Republican army unit broke into her tomb to plunder the jewels that were buried with her. Her corpse was left exposed. </p>
