<div class='layout'><p>Cream Soda Days</p><p>“奶油苏打”的日子</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When I was about nineteen, I read the Pentagon Papers and learned what was really going on in Vietnam. As a result, I started to have some major conflicting feelings and some nasty fights with my dad.</p><p>19岁时，从电影《五角大楼文件》（The Pentagon Papers）里，我了解到越战的真相，思想也发生了彻底转变，并因此与父亲有些不快的争论。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By then he was drinking heavily, and he wasn't the greatest opponent to argue with. But I had a new truth that replaced the old one even more strongly. I started to believe in peace. And I began to realize how far governments would go in order to get people to believe them.</p><p>那时，父亲沉迷于酒精，并不是最有力的争辩者。但我的新发现将更有力地取代先前的想法。我开始崇尚和平，并逐渐意识到政府不惜一切手段博取人们的信任。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For one thing, the Pentagon Papers showed what the CIA and the Pentagon people truly knew, and that the president was being carefully coached to put words together and lie to the American people. He was saying the opposite of the truth to trick the American people into thinking they should actually support the war. For instance, the papers got right down to the Gulf of Tonkin incident -which never happened the way the government said it did. The papers also said how, in every battle, the public was always told that ten times as many Viet Cong as Americans died, despite the fact that we had no way to count them. And most Americans believed this crap. The Pentagon Papers documented this deliberate deception.</p><p>《五角大楼文件》揭露了中情局和五角大楼人员所知道的真相，总统巧言令色，欺骗了美国人民。他颠倒黑白，诱骗人民支持战争。例如，其中指出“东京湾事件”纯属政府虚构，以及为何每次官方公布越共死亡人数都为我军的10倍，事实上他们无法计算。大多美国人却相信政府的一派胡言，《五角大楼文件》则揭示出这是一个精心设置的骗局。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Learning about that was one of the hardest things I had to deal with in my life. You see, I just wasn't raised to believe that a democracy like ours would spread these kinds of lies. Why was the United States government treating the American people as the enemy and purposely duping them It made no sense to me.</p><p>接受这一真相是我此生中最困难的事之一。我在一个倡导民主的国家长大，难以相信在这样的民主下会充满着谎言。美国政府为何与人民为敌，蓄意欺骗我们？欺骗对我而言毫无意义。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And the worst thing that came after that, for me, wasn't the Vietnam War itself, but the pain and stress it caused people. That's because, as I was becoming an adult, I started gaining a new ethic - a profound care for the happiness and welfare of people. I was just starting to figure out that the secret to life - and this is still true for me -is to find a way to be happy and satisfied with your life and also to make other people happy and satisfied with their lives.</p><p>我认为，最坏的并非越战本身，而是它带给人们痛苦和压力。因为我已是成年人，有我自己的道德观——深刻关注人民的生活疾苦。我开始寻找生活真谛——如今我仍在这样做——我行事做人只为自己和他人拥有一个快乐人生。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even in high school, where I believed in truth with a capital T, I was willing to change my beliefs if someone came along to show me something better. That's what the Pentagon Papers did for me. They pointed out that even the president was subject to the pressures of the military-industrial complex, the major institution of our land. And after reading this, I decided not to vote, that it wouldn't matter either way. I figured that pretty much I'd get the same life no matter who was elected. I thought it was better not even to go into the voting booth.</p><p>即使高中的我并不理解真相的意义，但如果有人更真实地告诉我，我仍愿意改变自己的想法。《五角大楼文件》对我的意义就在于此。它指出了我们这片土地的主要规则：即使总统都会受制于军事工业。之后，我决定不再投票，因为那并不重要。我觉得无论谁当选，我的生活都一成不变，我甚至不愿靠近投票站。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Gulf of Tonkin</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Gulf of Tonkin incident was an alleged attack on two American destroyers (the USS Maddox and the USS C. Turner Joy) in August of 1964 in the Gulf of Tonkin by North Vietnamese gunboats. Later research indicates that most of the attacks did not actually occur.</p><p>1964年美方声称，美军两艘战舰（分别为“马杜克斯号”和“杜恩勒号”）于8月遭致北越战舰袭击，这就是“东京湾事件”。之后的调查显示大多袭击都属虚构。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>According to the Pentagon Papers and various reports, the attacks were pretty much made up by President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. The U.S.-supported South Vietnamese regime had been attacking oil-processing facilities in North Vietnam, but it was the CIA that helped plan and support it in order to give the administration a good reason to involve the U.S. in the conflict.</p><p>根据《五角大楼文件》以及各方报道，大多袭击皆为林肯·B·约翰逊政府的捏造。美国支持的南越政权袭击了北越的石油加工厂，但这是在美国中情局的帮助下实行的计划，只为把美国卷入此次冲突。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Not everyone reading this is going to remember this incident, but finding out about it was instrumental in changing my own feelings about the Vietnam War.</p><p>不是每个人读到此处都会回忆起“东京湾事件”，但它的存在改变了我对越战的看法。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But I did vote a couple of times. I voted for a guy named George McGovern, who promised he'd find a way to stop the war. I voted for Jimmy Carter, because the words he spoke seemed to come from the same philosophical point of view as my own. He believed, as I did, that war was a last resort and not a first.</p><p>但我还是投过几次选票。其中一次投给了乔治·麦戈文，他许诺尽力停止战争。我还投过吉米·卡特，因为他的演讲所表现出的哲学观点与我一致。我们都相信，战争不是首选的解决方法，而是最坏的打算。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I voted for George W. Bush in 2000, because I thought it would be nice to have an average Joe kind of person in the White House instead of a smart, well-educated one. Someone who could only speak in very small words. Okay, I'm joking. The fact is I voted for Ralph Nader. But since all the pundits said that a vote for Nader was a vote for Bush, I now tell people I voted for Bush just to watch their jaws drop.</p><p>2000年时我投票给乔治·W·布什，因为我希望一位平常无奇的人主宰白宫，而不是一位英明的受过良好教育的人。也许有人因此唏嘘，其实这不过是我的玩笑，事实上我将选票投给了拉尔夫·纳德。但自从所谓的权威人士们说选拉尔夫意味着投票给布什，我就告诉人们自己把选票投给了布什，这让许多人大跌眼镜。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Seriously, though, I still think about this whole era with a lot of pain. Being brought up by my dad, who'd taught me that we had the best government in the world and that our government was the best one there ever could be even with its flaws, well, that kind of fell apart. He told me the purpose of the government was to take care of its people and make things better for them.</p><p>严肃地说，我仍觉得这个时代带给我极大痛苦。从小到大，父亲给我灌输的是，即使有些不足之处，我们的政府仍是世界上有史以来最好的政府。这正中政府下怀，让人民变得更易管理。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During the Vietnam War, of course, there was a mandatory draft. When you turned eighteen, you had to register. If you were a college student, you would get what was called a 2S deferment; otherwise you would be classified as 1 A. That meant that any day the military could draft you and send you off to boot camp.Once you were 1A, the government had a year to draft you. After that, you would be exempt. That's why not everyone who was 1A wound up serving.</p><p>越战期间，自然也有义务服役法，年满18岁则需服役。若为在校大学生，可以缓征，条件是拿到2S证，否则就必须立即服役。如果拿到的是1A证，也就是随时待命，那就会被军方送入新兵训练营。之后的一年内，政府还会进行选拔，有人也可能被免于服役。所以并非每个拿到1A的人都会马上服役。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I submitted a report card to the San Jose draft board in order to get my 2S deferment, but I didn't submit one of the proper forms the government required to show you were a college student. By mistake I only sent in my report card.</p><p>为拿到2S证，我向圣·荷塞征兵局呈交了一份报告卡，但不是政府要求的标准格式，交上去的只是我自己的报告卡而已。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A couple of months later, a big delay, I received notice that the San Jose draft board had voted five to three to make me 1A. What But I was a student.</p><p>几个月后，我接到大大延误的通知：圣·荷塞征兵局以5比3的投票结果发给我1A证。什么？我可是在校大学生！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This is when I decided that I would go to prison or Canada or, more likely, try to get let off by a judge rather than go to Vietnam. In fact, a judge in San Jose - his name was Judge Peckham - had let a couple of guys off as conscientious objectors despite their lack of membership in a church.</p><p>我开始犹豫自己是进监狱还是逃往加拿大，更有可能的是尽力让法官解除服役，不用前往越南。事实上，圣·荷塞的一位帕克罕（Peckham）法官已释放了好几个拒绝服役者，即使他们并非教会成员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One of those people let off had been one of the brightest math stars at my high school, Allen Stein. Quite a coincidence. So I had good reason to expect the same in my situation.</p><p>被释放的人中有一位曾是我们高中的数学高材生亚伦·斯坦。真是无巧不成书，我有理由相信自己会受到同等礼遇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So since I was 1A anyway, I took a year off from school to program computers and earn money to pay for my third year of college and buy a car.</p><p>无论如何，既然拿了1A证，我就休学一年，用于设计电脑和赚取第三年的学费，而且购买了一辆车。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then an amazing thing happened. The U.S. Congress created a draft lottery. That meant that those of us who were 1A would know the likelihood of our being called up. This was so it wouldn't be random. That way, you would know your chances - and I thought it was great. It helped me plan my life.</p><p>后来却发生了一件骇人听闻的事，美国国会决定抽签征兵，那意味着我们有1A证的人都清楚自己有前往战场的可能性。这其实没有多大随机性。以此方式，你知道自己被选中的几率——我认为这太精彩。它几乎是在帮我计划人生。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The way the draft lottery worked was your birthday determined what order you got called in. They would assign ever one's birth date to a number from 1 to 366. So January 1 might be 66, January 2 might be 12, it was totally random.</p><p>抽签征兵通过个人的生日来决定参军的顺序。他们会为每个人的生日指定一个号码，从1号到366号。所以，1月1日可能会是66号，1月2日可能是12号，这完全随机。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Well, during the week before they announced the results of the lottery, I got a feeling I have never had before or since. A feeling of physical warmth, like I was going to be protected and get a high number in this lottery. I had a stronger level of certainty than I would ever have let myself feel about the unknown. I can't explain it. I'm not a superstitious person in any way. I havealways believed in reality, the truth, and the provable. But this was so certain in my head. I rode my bike around, just smiling and smiling and smiling about it. I couldn't stop. It was a wonderful, positive feeling, and I couldn't ignore it and pretend it wasn't there.</p><p>他们宣布结果的前一周，我有一种前所未有的感觉，感觉自己冥冥中受到保护，定会在此次抽签中得到一个很大的数字。我有着超强的第六感，难以解释。我并不迷信，只相信事实、真相和得以证明的事物。但那时我心中却如此肯定这一结果。我骑着自行车四处闲逛，因自己的预感而喜笑颜开、情不自禁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And sure enough, I read in the newspaper the day of the draft lottery that I got number 325. A great number! That meant it was virtually certain I wouldn't be drafted. It's so weird. I got such a great number, but I wasn't even surprised or elated. I felt like I'd known it all along. The feeling I'd had was that strong.</p><p>后来我从报上得知自己的号码是325。好数字！它表明我不用从军。不过这事略显灵异，因为抽得好号码竟在意料之中。仿佛一开始我就知道结果似的，我的预感如此之强。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But then something terrible and unexpected happened.</p><p>但其后不幸却突如其来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>About a week after I got my draft lottery number, I got a letter from the San Jose draft board. It said -in one sentence - that they were granting me a student deferment after all.</p><p>得知抽签结果的1周后，我收到来自圣·荷塞征兵局的信，仅有一句话：准予我为缓征应召学生。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This, after taking months to notify me that they'd voted five to three not to grant my student deferment when I deserved it, was bad enough. But worse, it also meant that in a later year they could make me 1A a second time.</p><p>在我需要时，他们却让我等上几个月，以5比3的投票决定不给予我学生的缓征证，而在此时又告诉我通过，真是糟透了。但更糟的是这意味着1年后他们会第二次给我1A证。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I stood there with the letter in my hand, stunned. They were playing tricks with my life. Dirty tricks. They used the application I'd made for a student deferment as an excuse to grant it to me now, knowing that I already had a great 1A number.</p><p>我拿着那封信，头晕目眩。他们以我的生活为游戏——龌龊的游戏。即使知道我已抽到极好的1A数字，他们却以我的申请书格式不对为借口而延迟准许我缓征。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From that point on, I saw that the government would do whatever it could to beat a citizen, that it was just a game. And this was the exact opposite of the way I had thought of government my whole life. That episode taught me an important lesson about government, authority, even the police. You couldn't trust them to do the right tiling.</p><p>从那一刻起，我就看清了美国政府，他们以公民为敌，把这一切当作游戏，这与我想象中的政府完全相反，你无法相信他们是在为民服务。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now I had to go back to the draft board and request to keep my 1A -which was what I'd had anyway - and keep the same number. Luckily, they agreed.</p><p>于是我不得不再次去征兵局，要求保留我的1A证。不管怎样，这是我的号码，应该保留它。幸运的是，他们同意了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I can't even describe to you the shock and disgust I felt at ourgovernment: that they would play this kind of game with my life, that they didn't care about people the way my dad had taught me. I'd thought the government was here to protect us, but that turned out to be wrong. I now believed the government was just out to do what was good for the government and would lie about anything they could get away with. They were not there to do sensible things, and they played with my life in the worst possible way.</p><p>对政府行为，我所感受的震惊和恶心非笔墨所能形容：他们将我们的人生玩弄于掌股之间，并非如父亲所说，他们关心民众疾苦。我曾以为政府庇护我们，但适得其反。那之后，我只相信政府只为自身服务，并为此不惜一切手段。他们不会明理行事，以最糟的方式玩弄了我的人生。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From then on, my dad and I were at complete odds. I never trusted authority after that. That's too bad, because since founding Apple and all, I've met lots of good people in the government. But still, this hangs over me. I can hardly trust anything I read.</p><p>从那时起，我也与父亲完全不和。我再也不相信当权机构。这真是糟糕，因为自从我创建苹果以来，我遇到很多善良的政府人员。但这一想法仍盘踞我的心底，我甚至不能相信任何我阅读的东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So between the time I was a kid, when my dad taught me extreme ethics, and the time I realized what was going on with the Vietnam War, I changed profoundly, a full 180 degrees. I became skeptical. I stopped believing blindly in things. It was a major turning point. I lost the trust I'd always had in institutions of all kinds and it has never really returned.</p><p>在父亲教育下形成的道德观，到看清越战的真相时，已彻底改变，而且是180度的转变。我变得容易怀疑，不再盲目相信，这是很重要的转变。我对各种制度都失去了信心，再也不能重拾回来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I swore to myself I would put up my own life before letting something like the Vietnam War ever happen again to young kids.</p><p>我发誓，我会以生命来保护年轻一代再也不会经历越战这样的噩梦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Maybe you've seen pictures of me from the early days and thought I looked like a hippie. I guess I did, a little. But let me tell you, I was never a hippie.</p><p>也许从我早期的照片，你们会认为我像一名嬉皮士。我想我的确有那么一点，但我告诉你，我从不是一位真正的嬉皮士。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I tried to be a hippie, but I could never be what they were - not in high school or even in college when all that protest stuff was going on. I'd try to hang out with hippies because I stood with them politically, but they'd usually ask me to leave because I wouldn't use drugs. I still wanted to hang around them because I felt my mind was so open - as open as theirs were - and I got what they were saying. I wanted them to be open with me, but their drugs got in the way. They didn't trust me because I wouldn't do drugs with them.</p><p>我尝试成为嬉皮士，但却做不到。不要说高中，就是在大学，当所有反对者开始游行，我也无法加入。我曾尽力融入嬉皮士中，总想靠近他们，但他们总叫我离开，因为我不吸毒。但我仍想融入那个团体，因为我认为自己的思想和他们一样开放。我理解他们的观点，也希望他们对我敞开胸怀，但毒品却将我拒之门外。只因不愿一起吸毒，我难以取得他们的信任。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But I believed in almost everything they were trying to do. Everything I was reading about hippies and hippie beliefs in the late 1960s - the free love movement, things like putting flowers in guns - I knew that was me and what I wanted to be. I agreed with every bit of it. I believed, like hippies did, that everybody should be able to get along and help each other out and live out whatever kind of existence they wanted. And I believed it could be an existence without structure and without laws and without organization and without politics.</p><p>他们所做的一切都与我的信念相符。20世纪60年代一切有关嬉皮士的运动和信念——自由性爱运动，将鲜花插上枪支等等，我知道这都是我想做的事。我有着深切共鸣。正如嬉皮士所做的那样，我相信，每个人都能和平共处，互相帮助，到达理想的彼岸。我相信，没有组织、法律、机构和政治的社会是存在的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>People should just agree to live together and be good people, I really believed that. I was tremendously influenced by these kinds of hippie thoughts, these kinds of philosophies.</p><p>人们愿意一起生活，并与人为善。我真的相信这些，我被嬉皮士思想和这类哲学深深影响。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I would wear this little Indian headband, and I wore my hair really long and grew a beard. From the neck up, I looked like Jesus Christ. But from the neck down, I still wore the clothes of a regular kid, a kid engineer. Pants. Collared shirt. I never did have the weird hippie clothes. I was still middle ground; I was still the way I'd grown up. No matter how hard I tried, it was like I couldn't get outside of normal. Hippie is a way of life, not just a matter of clothes and hair, and I didn't lead that kind of life. I didn't live in weird little places with no money with weird curtains hanging in my windows. And I didn't do drugs. I wouldn't.</p><p>带上印度头巾，留着长发，蓄上蔓延到脖子的山羊胡，在我看来就像耶酥基督。但脖子以下，我还是着装正常，不过是一位年轻工程师，宽松长裤，带领衬衫。我从不会穿嬉皮士的怪诞服装，我仍保持中庸，保留我自小以来的风格。无论我多么努力，都仍是中规中矩。嬉皮士代表着一种生活方式，远非衣服和发型那么肤浅，我没体验过这样的生活。我也没选择在奇怪的地方生活，挂一些怪模怪样的窗帘，而且身无分文。我没有吸毒，也不会这样做。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At the time, not doing drugs or drinking made me real different. I mean, at the time, especially during my second year at De Anza and for years and years after, people would say things like: "Oh, using LSD can really expand your mind." I remember a guy -John was his name -who claimed that all the A's he got were when he was on acid.</p><p>那一时代，不吸毒不喝酒让我与众不同。尤其De Anza二年级之后，多年以来，人们都习惯说：“噢，迷幻药给我们更广阔的思维。”我记得有位叫约翰的小伙子，曾宣称他在用药状态下每科拿到A。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But I thought to myself: Well, if drugs are really better for your mind and can make you think better, then wait a minute. When you take a drug, it's you plus the drug that's working, right It's not just you. And I really, really wanted to be successful in my life just based on me and my mind alone. I knew that I was bright andthat ray brain was going to take me places. I didn't ever want it to be an equation that amounted to a result coming from my brain plus something else. I wanted to be judged on my own abilities, on what I did and what I thought, and that alone. So that was pretty much my view on drugs, and I never did any of them.</p><p>但我想：毒品有益思考吗？嗑药后更为聪明，那是加上药物带来的结果，对吗？那就不是你自己的聪明。而我真真正正希望完全凭自己的聪明才智走向成功。我很聪明，全凭自己就可成功。我从不希望借助其他事物而达到目的。我希望别人只通过我本身来断定我的能力。因此，对毒品，我从不想涉足。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As for drinking, I didn't even get drunk until I was thirty, in 1980. It was on my first flight out of the United States to Sri Lanka. I was extremely scared on the plane so I was drinking. I wasn't sure they'd let you off a plane if you were drunk. I managed to walk off the plane without assistance, and I ended up telling a really awful joke to a customs official:</p><p>关于饮酒，1980年前，即30岁前我从未醉过。第一次喝醉是在美国飞往斯里兰卡的飞机上。我想以喝酒来消除自己极度的不安。我不清楚他们是否允许乘客醉着下机。总之我竭尽全力自己走下飞机，最终还给海关讲了个极糟糕的笑话：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A lady who'd never seen an elephant before saw an escaped one in her garden. Shrieking, she called the police. "There's a huge animal in my garden!" she said. "Pulling up the vegetables with his tail! And you wouldn't believe where he's putting them!"</p><p>一位从未见过大象的女士在自己的花园里发现了一只逃跑的大象。她大声尖叫，然后报警。“我的花园里有只巨型动物！”她说，“它可以用尾巴卷起蔬菜！你更难以相信它把蔬菜放进了哪里！”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I don't remember if he laughed or not. I don't think so. It's not a joke I normally would have told. It's sort of dumb and hard to get.</p><p>我不记得他有没有笑，我想没有。这不是我通常讲的那种笑话，有点像冷笑话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Anyway, I never liked alcohol. It made people act noisy and out of control. My dad, for instance, he used to drink martinis. I always noticed how he reasoned differently when he was drunk. Especially as he and I got older, I thought it got really out of hand, the way he would get drunk and yell at my mother. That's not the way he was when he wasn't drinking.</p><p>无论如何，我不喜欢酒精。它让人们行为狂躁而失态。就像我父亲，他曾经习惯饮用马提尼。我一直都注意到，他喝醉时如何思维异常。特别是我逐渐长大、他慢慢变老的过程中，他喝醉了还会对妈妈大喊大叫，那种行为真是过分，这可与他清醒时大相径庭。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So I didn't drink or do drugs, and as I said, that usually made it kind of weird for the hippie people I wanted to be friends with, people who thought like me in every other way. What a sad thing. During that second year at De Anza, I remember driving my first car down to Santa Cruz. This was back when there were hitchhikers all over the place. (The car I was driving was this purple convertible I'd named Hubbs after a weird chemistry professor I had, but it wasn't that funny a joke because neither the car nor the professor was really that weird.)</p><p>所以，我不曾喝酒和嗑药，正如我先前所说，这也让我和那些想交往的嬉皮士朋友分道扬镳，尽管我们在其他观点上思想一致。在De Anza的第二年，我驾驶自己的第一辆车前往圣克鲁兹。那时四处皆是搭便车的旅行者。我驾驶的是辆紫色可折篷的车。我将其命名为哈勃斯（Hubbs），这名字来源于我的一位古怪的化学教授。但这并非趣闻，因为车和教授都并非真的那般古怪。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Anyway, I stopped and picked up a group of people. They weredefinitely hippies. And I took them down to Santa Cruz. We're hanging out on the boardwalk and I notice that one of them, a young girl sitting on a bench, was breast-feeding. Breast-feeding! I'd never seen anything like that before in my life! I just turned my head away really quickly, but it made such an impression on me. I started talking to her, and immediately fell in love with her and her baby. It turned out that she and her baby and a bunch of people all lived together in this commune near me in Sunnyvale. Later I would ride my bike out there a lot and stop at a park near their house and read books. I would go over and hang out with them. We'd eat and do the ohm chanting and all of that. And they would take me with them to meet all these Eastern philosophy- type teachers, really getting me exposed to Eastern thoughts of peace and quietness. I listened to these principles of meditation, and I would just sit down and try to get my head into a quiet place by myself.</p><p>不管怎样，我停车带上了一大群人，他们都是嬉皮士。我送他们到了圣克鲁兹，一起行走于木板路上。我注意到他们中的一个年轻女孩坐在长椅上给孩子喂奶。喂奶！我以前都未见过这样的事。我只是快速移开了自己的视线，但已经印象深刻。我与她交谈，很快就爱上了她和她的小宝贝。从谈话中我得知她和孩子与一群人一起居住，就在阳光谷的一个社区，离我很近。之后，我本可以经常骑自行车去那里，在他们房子附近的公园阅读，也可以和他们一起待上一段时间，一起聚餐，谈笑风生。他们或许可以带我去拜访那些有着东方哲学思想的老师，让我得到和平宁静的东方思想的熏陶。我听说过这些默想的原理，我也可以坐下让自己进入宁静的状态。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The sad thing was, eventually even these hippies didn't want to hang around me anymore. It made them uncomfortable that I didn't do drugs.</p><p>难过的是，这些嬉皮士们却不想与我共度光阴。只因我不嗑药，这让他们不太自在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So this was a hard social time for me. I remember that at one point I was taking some night classes at San Jose State and this pretty girl comes up to my table in the cafeteria and says, "Oh, hi." She just starts talking to me, and I'm so nervous all I can think to ask her is what her major is. She says, "Scientology." I'd never heard of this, but she assured me it was actually a major and I believed it.</p><p>对我来说，这是一段困难的社交时期。我曾在圣·荷塞上了些夜校。在自助餐馆里，一位漂亮女孩前来搭讪：“嗨。”我如此紧张，只知道问问她的专业。她回答：“科学论。”我从未听说过，但她让我相信这专业的确存在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>She invited me to a Scientology meeting, and of course I went. I ended up in the audience watching this guy make this incredible presentation about how you can basically be in better control of yourself and that you could get really happy from that.</p><p>她邀请我参加科学论会议，我欣然前往。最后，我听到有人做了一份不容置信的陈述，关于人如何能从根本上更好控制自己，并且能从中获得乐趣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After the meeting, the girl I met sat with me in some little office for an hour, trying to sell me these courses to become a better person. I was going to have to pay money for them.</p><p>会议之后，我与那个女孩在小办公室里谈了一个小时，她努力向我销售这些旨在“完善自身”的课程，我将不得不付钱给他们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I said to her, "I've already got my happiness. I've got my keys to happiness. I don't need anything. I'm not looking for any of this stuff." And I meant it. The only thing I mightVe wanted was a girlfriend, that's for sure, but the rest of the stuff I already had. I had a sense of humor, and I had this attitude about life that let me choose to be happy. I knew that whether to be happy was always going to be my choice, and only my choice.</p><p>我对她说：“我已找到快乐，也知道快乐的密码。我不需要这样的课程。”我的意思是，我唯一缺的可能是位女朋友，但其他东西我都拥有了。我具有幽默感，对生活我也保持这样的态度，只有快乐会成为我的选择。我认为是否快乐，取决于自己，只是自己。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Plus I had these values, values I'd grown up with. I already had this peaceful feeling inside my head. To this day, I'm one of those people whose head just floats. I really did feel happy most of the time. I still do.</p><p>这些是我的价值观，从小到大以来形成的价值观。在我的心中，已有宁静之感。这一天，我真的觉得自己铁石心肠。但大多时间里，我的确是快乐的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So the bottom line, of course, is she never sold me any courses or anything. In fact, she just walked out and never came back. When I wasn't interested in buying her courses, she left and just let me sit there. I sat and sat, waiting for her to come back. Finally I walked out the door and left, too. I thought, Man, that's too bad. She was just about sales, that's all she was.</p><p>当然，正因如此，她最终没有卖给我任何课程。事实上，她走出去就再没回来。当我对她推销的课程毫无兴趣，她就离开，让我独自一人坐在那里。我坐了很久很久，等着她回来。最后我也离开了。我想：真可惜。她只关心她的销售，那就是她的一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After my year at De Anza, I decided the thing to do was to take a job where I could actually program computers. I thought I'd skip a year of school so I could earn enough money to go for a third one, at Berkeley maybe.</p><p>到DeAnza后，我决定找份工作，开始真正编程。我希望在休学的一年里，自己可以赚到足够的钱去另一所大学，也许可以是伯克利分校。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, for a while I'd been telling my dad that I definitely was going to own a 4K-byte Data General Nova someday. That was just enough kilobytes needed to program in. It was this huge, powerful computer at the time. I loved its internal architecture and everything about it. I even had a poster of it up in my room. So I heard there was a place in Sunnyvale that sold these Data General computers. My friend Allen Baum and I drove down to the place.</p><p>但之后我却告诉父亲很想在某天拥有一台4千字节的通用数据公司的NOVA机。它只有千字节的容量，但却是那时最庞大和功能强大的电脑。我喜爱它的内部构造等等一切。我甚至将它的海报贴于我的房间。我听说阳光谷的某个地方正在销售这些通用数据电脑。于是我和朋友亚伦·波美一同开车前往。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Well, the office was beautiful, and right in the middle of the lobby was this big glass display with a large computer in it. It wasn't a room-sized computer like a mainframe, but a midsizedcomputer. It was about as large as a refrigerator, with other things like large printers and disk drives the size of dishwashers attached to it. There were some wires hanging loose with engineers working on them. And I thought, Wow, here's a computer actually being designed and built. That was a shock for me to see.</p><p>那是间美丽的办公室，大厅正中央的玻璃柜里展示着那台大电脑。它并非房间大小的电脑，而只是中型。大小就如冰箱，与大型打印机和洗碗机大小的磁盘驱动器相连。操纵电脑的工程师身上还挂着一些电线。当时我想：哇，眼前真是一台通过设计而制造的电脑。能亲眼目睹它带给我很大震撼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Another shock turned out to be that I had walked in the wrong door, that I wasn't at the Data General company at all, but at a smaller company called Tenet. Allen and I both filled out applications for jobs as programmers - and you know what We got them.</p><p>另一震撼是，我完全误打误撞，进入了一家叫做泰伦特的小公司。我和亚伦都申请了程序员的职位。知道后来怎样吗？我们成功了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We got to program in the language FORTRAN, and also in machine language, which is nearest to the lowest-level language (Is and Os) a computer can understand. We got to know that computer so deeply that summer. We really got into the depths of its architecture. Personally, I didn't think much of the architecture inside, although they ended up building something pretty good - a working computer, a fast computer, a low-cost computer for what it was. I mean, it cost more than $100,000, and those were 1970 dollars. I was impressed by that. It had an operating system that worked well and several programming languages.</p><p>我们用FORTRAN语言编程，也用机器语言，它是接近电脑所能理解的最简单的语言（1或0）。那个夏天，我们的电脑知识更上一层楼。我们真正深入理解了电脑的构造。个人而言，我并不赞同当时大多数电脑的内部构造，尽管它们最后的成果也很好——电脑能运转，而且低成本高效率。我是说相对它的价值而言的低成本。要知道一台电脑的成本超过10万美元，而且是20世纪70年代的美元！这让我记忆犹新。它还有一个正常运作的操作系统和多种编程语言。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, of course, in no way was that Tenet computer like our computers today. It had no screen for a display and no keyboard to type into. It had lights you had to read off a front panel, and it took information from punch cards. But for the time being, yeah, I guess it was pretty cool.</p><p>当然，那时泰伦特的电脑可与我们现在的电脑有着天壤之别。它没有屏幕以供演示，也没有键盘用于输入。你可从它前面的板上看到些灯光闪烁。同时，它通过穿孔卡来接收信息。但在那时，这种电脑真是酷极了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tenet actually went out of business the next summer - I stayed for the duration, having decided not to return to school that year after all - but my time there turned out to be really fortunate.</p><p>泰伦特公司接下来的夏季将开始销售电脑，而此时战事未完，我也决定休学一年，但在泰伦特公司的时光让我倍感幸运。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>You see, during the summer, I remember telling one Tenet executive how I had spent the last few years designing and redesigning existing computers on paper but could never build one because I didn't have the parts.</p><p>我还记得，就在那个夏天，我向泰伦特的总裁讲述自己那么多年在纸上反复设计现有的电脑型号，但却从没有建造过一台，只因缺乏零件。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One time, at my old friend Bill Werner's house, I got Bill to call up a chip company, but he could never get them to give us free parts, never. But I asked this Tenet executive, and he said, "Sure, I can get you the parts." I guess he had access to sample parts, and that was what I needed.</p><p>曾有一次，一位老朋友帮我打电话给器材公司，但他却也不能让对方提供免费零件。我问了问泰伦特的总裁，他回答说：“当然，我可以提供给你。”我想他有办法得到样品零件，而那正是我需要的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To help him avoid having to get me tons and tons of parts - parts I would need to build some kind of existing minicomputer - I decided I would build a computer that was just a little one with very few chips.</p><p>我准备制造一种现有的微型电脑，为了避免总裁给我成堆零件，我决定只用少量零件做一个更小的电脑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I'm talking about, like, about twenty chips -which is veiy, very few chips compared to the hundreds it would have taken to build a normal computer at the time.</p><p>我准备只用20个零件——在那个时候，一台电脑通常需要上百个零件，与之相比，这真是九牛一毛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, I had this other friend, Bill Fernandez, who lived down the block. I started hanging around at his house, and we just started putting together this little computer I designed (first on paper, of course) piece by piece, bit by bit. He helped me by doing all kinds of things - like soldering, for instance.</p><p>我还有位朋友，他叫做比尔·费尔南德斯，也住在我们的街区。我常去他家，我们共同制造出由我设计的小电脑，当然最先也是在纸上完成的。他帮我做各种各样的事情，例如焊接。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Anyway, we would do this in his garage, and then we'd ride our bikes down to the Sunnyvale Safeway, where we would buy Cragmont cream soda, and then drink it while we worked on this machine. That's how we started referring to it as the Cream Soda Computer. All the Cream Soda Computer was, really, was a little circuit board that allowed you to plug in connectors and solder the chips I had to the connectors. This board was tiny - I would say it was no larger than four to six inches.</p><p>不管怎样，我们可以在他的车库工作，然后骑车到阳光谷安全街（Sunnyvale Safeway），买克雷蒙特奶油苏打，然后回来一边享用一边制造我们的机器。我们“奶油苏打电脑”的提法也来源于此。所有“奶油苏打电脑”都是极小的电路板，你能轻松将其插入连接器，并把零件焊上。电路板极为袖珍，不会超过4～6英寸。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Like all the computers at the time, there wasn't a screen or a keyboard. No one had thought of that yet. Instead you'd write a program, punch it into a punch card, slide it in, and then you'd get your answer by reading the flashing lights on the front panel. Or, for instance, you could write a program that would tell the computer to beep every three seconds. And if it did, then you would know it was working. </p><p>不过，与那时电脑相同，我们做的电脑也没有屏幕或是键盘。没有人想到过。相反，你只能将编写的程序打入穿孔卡，放进去，然后你通过仪表盘灯光的闪烁来得到答案。例如，你可以编写程序，让电脑每隔3秒就发出“哔哔”的声音。如果它照做，你就知道它工作正常。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It turned out just as I had designed it, with few chips because I didn't want to ask that executive for too many free samples. So it was just the most minimum thing you could even call a computer. What I mean by that is, it could run a program. It could give you results.</p><p>因为我不想向总裁索取太多免费样品，所以我的设计只使用少量零件。因此，我是以零件数量的最低限度在制造一台电脑。也就是说，它能做的就是运行程序，给你答案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other significant thing about it was the fact that it had 256 bytes of RAM. (That's about the size in memory a word processor would take today to store this very sentence.)</p><p>它另一重要功能就是具有256字节的随机存取内存（RAM）。（约为我们现在用Word文档存下这一句话的大小。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>RAM chips were almost unheard of at this time. Back then, almost all computers had a type of memory called "magnetic core memories." When you dealt with them, you had to deal with messy voltages to spike the right currents down the wires, the wires that had to go into these little round magnetic cores that looked like tiny donuts you needed a magnifying glass even to see. This was definitely not the type of electronics I had in mind. With RAM chips, though, you just plug them in and connect them to the CPU, the brain of the computer. You connect them to the processor with wires and that's that. So, as you can see, I was extremely lucky to get those eight chips that added up to 256 bytes. And as I said, even then you couldn't do much of anything in that small a space.</p><p>现今很少有人知道RAM零件。那时，几乎所有电脑都有种存储器，叫做“磁芯存储器”。当你使用它们时，你不得不对付混乱的电压，得让电流通过电线，而电线则必须经过那些圆形小磁芯，它们看起来就像极小的油炸圈饼，甚至需要放大镜才能看清。这当然不是我心目中的电子学。对于这些RAM零件，只须把它们插入并连于CPU，即电脑的大脑。然后再把它们与信息处理器相连。最后，正如你所见，我真是太幸运了，只用了8个零件就能增加到256字节。就如我所说，电脑内部空间已小得再也不能做其他改动了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What Is RAM</p><p>RAM是什么？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>RAM, short for random-access memory, was a new type of computer storage back in 1970. These are chips whose contents can be accessed in any (i.e., random) order. All computers today have RAM chips inside to store data -not permanently, but while your computer is on and you're working. When the computer shuts down, the contents of RAM goes away.That's why you need to save your programs to disk.</p><p>RAM是random－access－memory的简写，意思是随机存取内存。这是20世纪70年代出现的一种新型电脑存储器。这种零件能记录任何方式进入的信息（这就是“随机”）。现在的电脑内部都有RAM零件用于储存数据——并不是永久储存，只是在使用电脑时用于储存数据。关闭电脑，RAM存储的内容也会随之消失。正因如此，我们都必须把程序存储于磁盘。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One day my mom called the Peninsula Times newspaper and told them about the Cream Soda Computer. A reporter came over and asked some questions about it and took some pictures. But just as he was finishing, he accidentally stepped on the power supply cable and blew out the computer. The Cream Soda actually smoked! But the article ran anyway, and that was pretty cool.</p><p>有天我妈妈打电话给《半岛时报》（PeninsulaTimes），透露给他们“奶油苏打电脑”的信息。随后一位记者对我们进行了采访，还拍了些电脑的照片。但就在结束时，他意外踩中了电源，中止了电脑的运行。“奶油苏打”冒烟了！但文章还是顺利发表，报道很酷。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But you know what I knew deep inside that it didn't matter that I had built this computer. It didn't matter because the computer couldn't do anything useful. It couldn't play games, it couldn't solve math problems. It had way too little memory. The only important thing was that finally, finally, I'd been able to actually build a computer. My very first one. It was an extraordinary milestone in that sense.</p><p>但是，你们知道吗？在我内心深处，认为这台电脑的出台对我并非大事，因为它不能做任何有用的事。它不能玩游戏，不能解答数学问题，存储量也太小。唯一的意义就是，我终于、终于能做出一台电脑了，它是我的第一台电脑。从这个角度来说，它是一座非凡的里程碑。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Five years later, companies would be building and selling computer kits that were just about at this level - they had the same amount of memory and the same awkward front panel of lights and switches.</p><p>5年后，有公司做出并销售这种电脑——相同大小的内存、笨拙的仪器盘和开关。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Looking back, I see the Cream Soda Computer as kind of a jumping-off point for me. And I got there early.</p><p>那时候，“奶油苏打电脑”对我而言是追求的终点，但我却太早到达。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One other thing: the Cream Soda Computer turned out to be the way I first met Steve Jobs. I was four years ahead of him in school so I didn't know him; he was closer to Bill Fernandez's age. But one day Bill told me, "Hey, there's someone you should meet. His name is Steve. He likes to do pranks like you do, and he's also into building electronics like you are."</p><p>另外，“奶油苏打电脑”也让我遇到了斯蒂夫·乔布斯。我比他高了4个年级，所以我们并不认识，他与比尔·费尔南德斯年纪相仿。有天比尔告诉我：“嗨，你应该见见斯蒂夫。他和你一样喜欢恶作剧，也有创造电子产品的理想。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So one day -it was daytime, I remember -Bill called Steve and had him come over to his house. I remember Steve and I just sat on the sidewalk in front of Bill's house for the longest time, just sharing stories -mostly about pranks we'd pulled, and also what kind of electronic designs we'd done. It felt like we had so much in common. Typically, it was really hard for me to explainto people the kind of design stuff I worked on, but Steve got it right away. And I liked him. He was kind of skinny and wiry and full of energy.</p><p>所以有一天，我记得是在白天，比尔邀请斯蒂夫到他家。我们坐在比尔家的人行道前，相谈甚久，但不过是分享一些彼此的故事——大多关于自己所做的恶作剧以及做过的电子设计。我感觉我们就是同声相应、同气相求。但更特别的是，我觉得向人解释自己的设计很难，但斯蒂夫却驾轻就熟，我很喜欢他。他瘦而结实，又精力充沛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So Steve came into the garage and saw the computer (this was before it blew up) and listened to our description of it. I could tell he was impressed. I mean, we'd actually built a computer from scratch and proved that it was possible -or going to be possible -for people to have computers in a really small space.</p><p>然后，斯蒂夫到车库参观了电脑并聆听我们的描述（这当然在电脑停止工作之前）。我们根据草图就制造了一台电脑，并证明电脑可以或是将要可以，小到足以放置在小房间里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Steve and I got close right away, even though he was still in high school, remember, and lived about a mile away in Los Altos. I lived in Sunnyvale. Bill was right -we two Steves did have a lot in common. We talked electronics, we talked about music we liked, and we traded stories about pranks we'd pulled. We even pulled a few together.</p><p>我与斯蒂夫马上就亲密无间，尽管他还上高中，又住在很远的洛斯阿图斯市，而我却住在阳光谷。比尔是对的——我们两位斯蒂夫的确有很多共同点。我们谈论电子学、喜欢的音乐、分享彼此的恶作剧故事，甚至一起做过一些恶作剧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When I met Steve Jobs I was still hanging out with this other guy I'd known since high school, Allen Baum.</p><p>遇上斯蒂夫·乔布斯后，我仍与一位高中时的朋友来往密切，他就是亚伦·波美。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Allen was kind of a nerdy, skinny guy with glasses when I first met him back in high school. We were both in the super-elite of students, not just the ones in top classes but students who outperformed pretty much everybody else. We'd be selected out by teachers to compete in math contests or go to speeches and lectures, that kind of thing. So we all knew each other. Most of us were considered by other kids to be kind of weird outsiders, and Allen was even smaller, scrawnier, and more outside than I was. He was even nerdier.</p><p>第一次遇到亚伦是在高中后期，他那时是位瘦得皮包骨的书呆子。我们都是尖子生，不仅是班上的，且是全校的。我们总被老师选去参加数学竞赛，或是演讲等等，所以我们相互认识。更多时候，其他孩子都远离我们，视我们为怪人。而亚伦甚至更为瘦小，更被拒之门外。他甚至更加书呆子化。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Later he came to be very into hippie things and San Francisco- type music like the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, but he started out just completely way, way on the outside.</p><p>后来，他推崇嬉皮士作风以及洛杉矶风格的音乐，比如“感恩而死”乐队和“杰费逊飞艇”乐队。但他只是有了自己的风格，仍然难以融入大众。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From high school on, I used to like to go visit Allen and his parents. They were Jewish with relatives who'd died in concentration camps; it was shocking and all so new to me. Allen's father, Elmer, was an engineer who loved humor - he was incrediblyfunny - and he was really active in civil rights causes. His mom, Charlotte, was like that, too. I thought of Elmer and Charlotte Baum as being so much like me --just kind of casual and fun.</p><p>自高中起，我就喜欢拜访亚伦一家。他们是犹太人，还曾有亲戚在集中营中罹难，对我来说这是骇人听闻的事。亚伦的父亲爱尔默是位幽默的工程师，他出奇的风趣，对民权事业甚是积极。他的母亲夏洛特也是如此。我总认为亚伦的父母与我是同一类人，风趣而又不拘小节。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So, as I said, I was hanging out with Allen a lot when Steve Jobs, who by now was a junior at Homestead High, had an idea. He wanted to create a huge sign on a giant bedsheet with a flip- off sign -you know, the middle-finger salute -right during graduation. He thought the sign should say "Best Wishes." We started calling it the "Brazilian Best Wishes" sign.</p><p>所以，就如我所说，我也与亚伦一起，就在斯蒂夫·乔布斯告诉我他的主意的时候，那时他还是家园高中的三年级学生。他毕业前想让一张巨大床单上弹出一块标牌——你一定知道伸出中指的姿势。他希望那标牌能说：“祝福你。”我们把它叫做“巴西祝福”牌。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So we went right to work. We got this big sheet -it had been tie-dyed because Allen and his brothers were always tie-dying everything back then - and spread it out in Allen's backyard. Anyway, we started sketching out our drawing with chalk - a big hand with its finger sticking up. And Allen's mother even helped us draw it -she showed us how to shade it so it looked more like a real hand, less like a cartoon. I remember how she sort of realized what the hand was doing partway through, but she just snickered at us and smiled, saying, "I know what that is." But she didn't stop us. I guess she didn't know what we planned to do with it, exactly.</p><p>我们就这样开始工作。我有一张大床单，它是扎染的，因为那时亚伦和他的兄弟们总是喜欢扎染各种各样的东西，我们把它铺于在亚伦的后院。然后，我们就开始用水粉画出一只手。亚伦的妈妈甚至帮我们画，她教我们怎样画出阴影让它更为逼真，而不显得卡通。我还记得，她大概已觉察出那只手的姿势，但她只是不动声色地笑了笑说：“我知道它的意思。”但是，她并没有阻止我们。我想她并不知道具体的计划。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On the sheet, we signed it "SWAB JOB. The S and W stood for Steve Wozniak, the A and B stood for Allen Baum, and JOB stood for Steve Jobs. We finished the sheet and rolled it up. Late that night, we climbed onto the top of the C building, where we planned to drop it. The idea was that we would attach it to this forty-pound fishing line and kind of pull it down when the graduating Homestead High seniors walked past.</p><p>在床单上，我们签上“SWABJOB”。其中S和W代表斯蒂夫·沃兹，A和B代表亚伦·波美，JOB则表示斯蒂夫·乔布斯。做好一切后，我们就把床单卷好。那天深夜，我们爬上C楼的顶层，决定在那里展示它。我们计划将它连于40磅的鱼线上，当家园高中毕业生经过时，我们就把它展开。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Well, we practiced it and found out that you just can't pull a sheet down off a roof and have it roll down nicely. It doesn't come down off the roof easily, and it will pull other junk off the roof, and it can come down all weird in different shapes.</p><p>在练习时我们发现，很难让床单漂亮地从楼顶展开。让床单展开并非易事，还会附带一些垃圾落下，而且它展开时总是怪模怪样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So the next night we tried to make this little cart thing with an axle and two wheels that we could pull. The idea was that itwould let the sheet down gradually. The axle was nearly eight inches wide. But we found that one of the wheels would always get stuck on its little track. We just couldn't get it right.</p><p>所以，第二天晚上，我们决定使用滑轮，即1个轴加2个轮子。这一方法可让床单慢慢展开。轴大约8英寸宽，但总有一个轮子会在轨道上停滞不前，怎么也弄不好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By the fourth night of trying to do this, Allen and I were working alone. Steve just didn't have the stamina to stay up and work all night. And by then we'd come up with another idea. Don't use the axle, but keep the wheels. We rigged up this little hookup on the building, higher than the sheet would be, and attached the fishing line and a couple of skates to it. We then tested it out. We stood on the roof, let go of the fishing line, and watched the little skates roll down their ramps until they pulled the sheet down so it scrolled down, pulling down the left side and the right side together. Left to right. It worked perfectly.</p><p>第四个晚上，只有我和亚伦一起做。斯蒂夫没有耐心坚持一整夜。那时我们又有新主意：不再用轴，只保留轮子。我们偷偷将它们连在大楼上，比床单还高，再连上钓鱼线和滑轮。然后，我们开始测试。我们从楼顶放下钓鱼线，看着小滑轮顺着下滑，直到拉开床单，左边和右边同时展开，它运作得完美无缺。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We almost got caught that night, by the way. We tried to test it again, but a janitor came along. We just ducked on that roof and were lying down as low as we could. I remember the janitor moving his flashlight around and the light landing on my hand. But before he could call anyone, we ran out of there like crazy.</p><p>那晚我们差点被抓住。我们本想再试一次，但门卫却过来巡逻。我们藏身于楼顶，尽量趴下。门卫用手电筒四处搜寻，最后灯光停留在我的手上。但是，在他叫人来之前，我们疯狂地逃走了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A couple of days later was graduation day. I woke up that morning to the phone ringing. It was Steve calling from school with bad news. It turned out someone, probably another student, had cut the fishing line and pulled the sign down that morning. So Steve got in trouble - I guess the "SWAB JOB" gave it away, and we never got to play our prank.</p><p>几天后的毕业日，斯蒂夫的电话把我从睡梦中叫醒。他告诉我一个坏消息：早晨有人——很可能是名学生——剪断了鱼线，标语被拉了下来。所以斯蒂夫惹上麻烦了——我想是“SWABJOB”透露了这一信息。而我们再也无法把恶作剧进行下去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Afterward I thought about this a lot. I finally came to the conclusion that even though our "Brazilian Best Wishes" sign didn't come off, it wasn't a failure. Some projects are worth the energy and worth spending a lot of time on, even if they don't come out perfectly.</p><p>之后我曾多次反思，最后得出结论：尽管我们的“巴西祝福”标语没有成功，但它并不代表失败。有些事物值得尝试，并投入大量时间和精力，即使结果不尽如人意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I learned about teamwork and patience and hard work from that prank - and I learned never to brag about my pranks. Because I found out a year later that Steve Jobs had shown some of the students our prank, showing off. And the guy who told me that - that Steve Jobs had shown him the sign -said he was the guy who cut it clown.</p><p>从恶作剧中我学到团队合作、耐性和勤奋。同时，我还有个教训，就是不要四处宣扬自己的恶作剧。因为，斯蒂夫曾向另一些学生炫耀我们的恶作剧，而一年后有个学生告诉我正是那个学生剪掉了鱼线。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Steve and I were into listening to Bob Dylan and his lyrics, trying to figure out who was better, Dylan or the Beatles. We both favored Dylan because the songs were about life and living and values in life and what was really important. The Beatles mostly made these nice little happy songs -you know, nice-to-know- you, nice-to-be-with-you, nice-to-be-in-love-with-you songs. They were simple -even after albums like Rubber Soul came out. The songs the Beatles did were not as deep down and affecting your soul and emotions as Dylan's were. They were more like pop songs. To us, Dylan's songs struck a moral chord. They kind of made you think about what was right and wrong in the world, and how you're going to live and be.</p><p>我和斯蒂夫开始欣赏鲍勃·迪伦的抒情音乐，想要判断出迪伦和甲壳虫乐队谁更优秀。我们都欣赏迪伦，因为他的歌都关注生命、生活和价值观，以及真正重要的事情。但甲壳虫大多时候都歌唱欢乐——众所周知的，很高兴认识你、很高兴跟你在一起、很高兴与你相爱，诸如此类。它们都很简单，甚至包括《橡胶灵魂》这张专辑之后的歌。甲壳虫乐队不像迪伦一样直击你的灵魂和情感，他们更像是流行音乐，而迪伦的歌却触击到人类的道德线。它们会引发你思考世界上的是非黑白，以及生活与生存的状态。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At any rate, this first introduction we never forgot, and later on Steve and I were really linked. Linked forever.</p><p>至少，第一次听到时，我们就觉得永不会忘记。而这也成为我和斯蒂夫之间的桥梁，永远将我们连在一起。</p></div>
