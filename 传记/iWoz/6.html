<div class='layout'><p>Phreaking for Real</p><p>电话飞客</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In 1971, the day before I headed off to my third year of college at Berkeley, I was sitting at my mother's kitchen table and there happened to be a copy of Esquire sitting there. Even though I never usually read this magazine, for some reason I started flipping through it that day.</p><p>1971年的一天，在我接到进入伯克利分校度过第三学年的通知之前，我在妈妈厨房的桌子上意外发现一份《时尚先生》（Esquire）杂志。尽管我通常都不读这类杂志，但那天我却不知为何草草翻阅了一下。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I came upon an article called "Secrets of the Little Blue Box." Those were interesting enough words to make me stop skimming and read that article all the way through.</p><p>其中有篇文章是《蓝色小盒的秘密》（Secrets of the Little BlueBox），其文趣味横生，我情不自禁地从头读到尾。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, it was labeled as an "incredible story", and I had no idea what a Blue Box was until I started reading the article. But as soon as I did, it just grabbed me. Wow! You know how some articles just grab you from the first paragraph Well, it was one of those articles, probably because this story was about tech people like me. Back then, there were never articles about tech people - really, never -so once I started reading this article, about people like me, I couldn't stop. It basically was a story about how a bunch of technical kids and young engineers around the country had figured out how to crack codes on the phone system. The article called them "phone phreaks." These people were able to figure out that by just whistling certain tones into a phone handset, they could make telephone calls within the Bell phone system for free.</p><p>这是篇小说，阅读之前我还不知道何为蓝盒子。但我开始阅读，就被深深吸引。哇！你知道有些文章在第一段就让你欲罢不能吗？那么这篇文章就是这样，不过也很有可能是因为它描写的是我这样的技术人员。那时，从没有一篇文章是描写技术人员的——真的，从没有——所以，我一读到这篇文章写的是我这样的人，就不能停止阅读。它讲述的是一群科技小孩和年轻工程师如何破解电话系统的密码。文章里把他们称作“电话黑客”。他们只需通过电话听筒发出某种音调就可破解。他们能在贝尔电话网络里打免费电话。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Essentially, they first would dial an 800 or 555 number, any free exchange, then they would make this tone sound to seize the line. If this certain tone worked, they'd get a chirp that meant they were now in control of a piece of phone circuit equipment called a tandem. (A tandem just waits for special tones to direct calls throughout the phone system.) The phone phreak could then give the system the tones it needed to dial any seven- or ten-digit number just by making a bunch of certain sounds that were equal to the numbers on a phone from Ma Bell's perspective.</p><p>基本上，他们最初会拨打800或是555，即任何免费交换台，然后他们用这一音调的声音来控制线路。如果可行，就会出现唧唧声，意味着他们已控制了“串联”电话电路设备。（“串联”是通过特殊的音调导入电话网络。）而电话黑客就能将它对应的音调接入网络，然后只需发出相当于老贝尔公司电话拨打号码的声音，就可以拨打任意7位或是10位的号码了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That sounded plausible in a way. I already had a basic idea about how the tone system worked on telephones. And the people in the article -in this "incredible story" -were claiming that by doing this, they were finding out things about the phone system no one knew about. I'm talking about things like its inherent bugs and holes and weaknesses and, of course, all the ways to take advantage of them. So, as I said, they were doing tilings by whistling tones into the phone lines, by tricking operators, by bouncing calls off satellites and back to other countries. They were doing all this stuff. And though it seemed an unbelievable story, I kept reading it over and over, and the more I read it, the more possible and real it sounded.</p><p>某种程度上，小说所言貌似有理。让我有个基本概念，如何能让电话的音调系统生效。把此故事标为“小说”的人宣称，照文中做法会发现电话网络无人知道的秘密，也就是我们能利用电话网络的漏洞。因此，他们能向电话线路发出哨声、欺骗操作系统，以及间断地呼叫卫星再回馈到其他国家。这些就是他们所做的事。尽管这是虚构故事，我仍是反复阅读，次数越多，我就越信以为真。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other thing that intrigued me about the article was the fact that it described a whole web of people who were doing this: the phone phreaks. They were anonymous technical people who went by fake names and lived all over the place. Some were in the Northeast, some in the Southeast, some were in the West. Just all over. The story told a tale about some guys who drove out to Arizona, clamped a wire to a pay phone, and were somehow able to literally take over the whole country's phone networks. It said they were able to set themselves up into ten-way conference calls.</p><p>文章吸引我的另一点是，事实上的确存在它描述的这一群人：电话黑客。他们都是匿名人士，使用假名，分布于各个地方。有些人生活在东北部，有些则在西部，四处都有。故事讲的是几个人开车到亚利桑那州，途中他们把收费公用电话的电线钳紧，不知怎么就可以控制整个区域的电话网络。据说他们可以接入10条路线进行电话会议。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The characters sounded just too perfectly described not to be true. I remember how it spoke about some blind kids who just wanted someone to talk to. Somehow they'd gotten the phone company people to tell them some of the secrets of the phone company and were using them to talk to each other. That made sense to me, too.</p><p>作者塑造的角色太过尽善尽美，显得不太真实。我还记得其中曾提到两个只想与别人聊聊天的盲童。不知他们怎么联系上了电话公司的员工，透露出电话公司的秘密，并得到帮助与彼此通话。这对我同样具有意义。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The article also talked about the ethics these guys supposedly had. That it wasn't just about free calls. One of the guys said he was basically trying to do a good thing by finding flaws in the system and letting the phone company know what they were. That appealed to me.</p><p>文章还表现出了这群人所具有的美德，不仅仅是免费电话。其中一人曾说他想通过发现这一漏洞，努力做些善事，让电话公司了解自己的状况。这也吸引了我。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The article also talked about one of the secrets these guys had discovered. Well, I already knew this secret, so I guess it was kind of a rediscovery. I'm talking about the technique of taking any phone -you can do it with any phone to this day - and tapping out phone numbers with the hook switch. What I mean is the actual switch on the phone that tells the phone company if the phone is on or off the hook. What you do is pick up the phone. You hear a dial tone, right Then if you click that hook switch once, it's like dialing a "1." Click it twice really quickly and that is the same as dialing a "2." Clicking it ten times in a row would be the same as dialing a "0." (The reason this works goes back to the old days of rotary phones when you dialed a "5," and the dial would swing back five times -click click click click click.) And like I said, the system still works like that to this day. Try it.</p><p>文中也讲到这群人发现的秘密之一。不过我已经知道这一秘密，所以我想那不过是再次发现。也就是打电话的技巧（你现在也可这样做），用听筒架上的开关拨电话。也就是说，电话真正的开关在听筒架上，它告诉电话公司电话是开是关。你只需拿起电话，就能听见拨号音，不是吗？然后按一下听筒架上的开关，听起来就像是在拨“1”，迅速地按两次，听起来就像是在拨“2”，连续按10次就像拨打“0”。（这一原理就如以前转盘电话的工作原理，当你拨“5”时，拨号盘就需来回摆动5次。）而且就像我所说，今天的系统运作仍然如此，值得一试。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But this was a trick only a very few people knew back then. So I could tell that the characters being described were really tech people, much like me, people who liked to design things just to see what was possible, and for no other reason, really. And because I knew the hook switch thing, too, I immediately got intrigued.</p><p>但是，这一技巧只有小部分人知道。因此，书中那些人物被塑造成技术人员，可以说他们和我类似，喜欢设计，寻求事物的可能性，自然为之。由于也知道电话听筒上的开关这一秘密，我一下子就被那篇文章迷住了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the Esquire article, there was a phone phreak named Joe. He was blind. According to the article, he'd discovered this cool thing: that if you play a really high E - two octaves above the high E on the guitar, for example, which is 2,600 hertz (Hz) exactly -it was the exact tone that seized the tandem and gave you control of the phone system. It probably still works to this day, and you can tiy that, too. Anyway, Joe was able to actually make this whistle sound with his mouth!</p><p>《时尚先生》那篇小说里，有位双眼失明的电话黑客，叫做乔。他有一个很酷的发现：如果你弹出高音，要高于吉他最高音2个音阶，比如高达2600Hz，就可以利用“串联”电路设备，控制电话网络。如今这样做仍然可行。但是，乔竟用嘴就能发出这样的哨音！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, Joe had perfect pitch -probably because he was blind, I don't know. His first whistle seized the line, and then he could make a bunch of short whistles to dial numbers. I couldn't believe this was possible, but there it was and, wow, it just made my imagination run wild. Because just by whistling this high E, he could from there dial a long-distance call that would then be free. To the phone company, it would look like a free 800 or 555 long-distance phone call. And he was doing it all with his mouth!</p><p>也许因为双眼失明，乔有着完美音感。第一次的哨声可占用线路，然后他就用一串短小的哨声来拨号码。我不能信以为真，但书中的描写和我的想象让我几近疯狂。仅仅通过吹出高音，他就能免费拨打长途电话。对电话公司来说，这就像一个800或是555的长途电话。而他仅通过自己的嘴就达到这一切！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Esquire article also described someone who went by the name of Captain Crunch, after the cereal (Cap'n Crunch), which used to have a whistle toy in it. Captain Crunch used the whistle and discovered the same thing the blind phone phreak did: that if you plugged the right hole in the whistle and hit that high E, that 2,600 Hz sound -it blew just the right note that basically seized the phone line for anything you wanted to do.</p><p>其中还有位叫“嘎吱上校”，源自麦片（Cap’nCrunch牌），以前这种麦片盒里有一种玩具口哨。“嘎吱上校”从口哨上也发现了同样的秘密：对着电话用口哨吹出高音，也刚好2600Hz，就可控制电话线路，做任何你想做的事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To make a call after seizing the line, Captain Crunch used a device the article called a "Blue Box." It put pairs of tones into the phone, similar to the way touch-tone phones work. This method worked everywhere on the multifrequency (MF) system in the United States, where Joe's and the cereal box's whistle only worked in a few places with old single-frequency equipment.</p><p>控制住线路后，“嘎吱上校”使用了一种设备对着电话发出一连串声音，就如按电话键的声音一般。这种设备就叫做“蓝盒子”。在美国，这种设备对多频率网络都能生效，但乔的方法和麦片盒里的口哨则只能用于少数使用单频率设备的系统。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the stoiy, the guy who built the Blue Box supposedly stole or had loaned to him a standard phone company manual that listed all the frequencies he would need to build it. The article said the phone company figured it out and started to withdraw all those manuals from every library in the country. They made it secret, in other words. They wouldn't let it out anymore. But you know what The secret was already out. Way out. Too late for the phone company, or so the article said.</p><p>故事中讲到，“蓝盒子”的创造应该有所来源，他可能阅读了一些标准电话公司手册，而其中罗列了所有他需要的频率。文中还提到电话公司发现后，就开始收回该地区所有图书馆的这类手册。他们要保守秘密，不再公开。但你知道吗？秘密还是泄露了。正如文中所说，悔之晚矣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This idea of the Blue Box just amazed me. With it, you could just hook into some 800 number and use that line to make one call after another, all over the world. It didn't plug into the handset or anything. It was very simple. You just put its speaker up to the mouthpiece of the phone. Although it was incredibly easy, only something like a thousand people in the country, technical people like me, could ever have figured it out and used it.</p><p>“蓝盒子”带给我震撼。通过它，只需拨打800之类，你就可以一个接一个地打电话到全世界的任何地方。你也无需把它塞进听筒，非常简单。你只须拿起它的扬声器对准电话的送话口。尽管看起来简单，但只有少数像我这样的技术人员才能发现并使用它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One of the first things I did after reading the article was to call up my friend Steve Jobs. He was just about to start twelfth grade at Homestead High School, the same high school I'd gone to. I started telling him about this amazing article, and how it made sense, really made sense, in a technical way. I told him that, according to the story, the whole system was grabbable. Attackable. And I told him how these smart engineers portrayed in the story overtook and used it. They apparently knew more about the phone system than even the phone company's engineers. If the article was right, and I thought it could be, that meant all the secrets of the phone company were out. It meant people like us were starting to create little networks in order to exploit them.</p><p>看完这篇文章，我做的第一件事就是给我的朋友斯蒂夫·乔布斯打电话。他那时还是家园高中的十二年级学生，我也曾在那里就读。我转述给他整篇文章的内容，告诉他从技术上说这是多么的有意义。我还说，通过那篇文章，我们可以看到整个电话网络不堪一击。我还告诉他，故事如何描绘那些聪明的工程师以及他们如何利用这一弱点。他们显然比电话公司的工程师们更懂电话网络。如果故事是真的（我认为应该是真的），那就意味着电话公司的秘密被公之于众。那么，我们这样的人就可以开始创建小网络来开发它们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This was just the most exciting thing for us two young guys to be talking about. I was twenty; Steve was probably about seventeen at the time.</p><p>对我们两个年轻小伙子来说，这是最令人兴奋的一件事情。那时，我20岁，而斯蒂夫可能才17岁左右。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And while I was on the phone with Steve that afternoon, I remember I just stopped mid-sentence and remarked, "Wait, Steve, this article is just too true. They put in real frequencies like 700 Hz and 900 Hz. They even gave the way to dial a '1a and a 3.' And they even gave the codes for dialing a call all the way to England."</p><p>那天下午，当我与斯蒂夫在电话旁准备实践时，我突然说：“等等，斯蒂夫。这篇文章写得太真了。他们写了具体频率比如700Hz和900Hz。他们还告诉我们如何拨“1”、“2”、“3”，甚至完全给了我们一套免费与英格兰通话的方法。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Steve and I came up with a plan to give it a shot.</p><p>我们计划做一件让人震惊的事情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>An hour later I picked Steve up and we drove down to SLAC, which is pronounced "slack" and is short for the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. It had a great technical library, just tremendous. It had the kinds of technical books and computer books and magazines you wouldn't encounter in normal libraries or any other place I knew. If there was any place that had a phone manual that listed tone frequencies - the manual the phone company was trying to pull out of circulation - this would be it.</p><p>1小时后，我开车与斯蒂夫一同前往SLAC，我们发音为“slack”，它是“StanfordLinearAcceleratorCenter”（斯坦福线形加速器中心）的缩写。那里有一所科技图书馆，藏书量巨大，有着各种各样的科技和电脑书籍以及杂志。有些书在普通图书馆或是其他我知道的地方都难以见到。如果某个地方还可以找到那本罗列所有音调频率的电话手册（也就是那本电脑公司竭力清除的手册），那么，那个地方就是它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Anyway, I snuck into this library on many Sundays during my high school and early college computer design days. I never felt like it was sneaking, exactly, because they always left the doors open. In my experience, I've found that smart people often leave doors open. Maybe it's because they have other things on their minds.</p><p>不管怎样，早在高中和大学设计电脑的那段日子，我就常常在星期天潜入这家图书馆。我从不感觉自己是偷偷摸摸地进来，因为他们总是敞开大门。我发现聪明人总是让门敞开的。也许是因为他们拥有的很多东西是在脑子里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So Steve Jobs and I snuck in that day, that Sunday in 1971, and started searching for books with telephone information. Like I said, that Esquire article gave tons of details, not only on how tones are used to dial numbers, but also on how the tones were in pairs. For instance, it said that the 700 Hz and 900 Hz tones together stood for a "1," that 700 Hz and 1,100 Hz meant a "2," that 700 Hz and 1,300 Hz together meant "3," and so on. There was even more detail than this, details I figured we could check right there at the SLAC library. So Steve and I sat in there looking for confirmation that this Blue Box thing was for real -we wanted the complete list of tones that could theoretically make all the digits. Because that would mean we could build one.</p><p>于是，我和斯蒂夫在那天，也就是1971年的一个星期天里，潜入那家图书馆寻找电话信息相关书籍。就像我所说，《时尚先生》提供给我们大量具体细节，不仅仅是如何运用音调打电话，还包括音调如何配对。例如，其中提到，700Hz加900Hz的音调就代表“1”，700Hz加1100Hz就是“2”，而700Hz加上1300Hz就表示“3”，诸如此类。甚至还有比这更为具体的内容，我们可以在SLAC图书馆里判断它的正确性。所以我和斯蒂夫在那里查找信息，可以证明这“蓝盒子”真实存在。我们想找到一份完整的音调频率清单，理论上它可以让我们拨打任何电话。因为这意味着我们也可以做一个“蓝盒子”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We were individually flipping through various books and I had a blue one in my hand, maybe two inches thick, with some phone system reference like the CCITT Handbook. In case you're wondering, CCITT is a long-forgotten acronym that stands for the Comite Consultatif International de Tele-graphique et Telephonique. It's the French name for an international standards- setting group for telegraph and, later, telephone systems.</p><p>我们各自去查阅书籍。然后我发现了一本蓝色封面的书，大概2英寸厚，其后附有一些参考文献，比如《CCITT（国际电报电话咨询委员会）手册》。如果你感兴趣，那么我告诉你，CCITT是一串长得难以记住的词组的缩写，即“ComitéConsultatifInternationaldeTélégraphiqueetTéléphonique”，这是一个电报国际标准制定组织的法文名字，后来运用于电话系统。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I was flipping around and suddenly stopped on a page. There it was: a complete frequency list for MF (multifrequency) telephone switching equipment.</p><p>我不停浏览，突然在一页上找到了自己想要的资料：多频电话转换设备完整频率表。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Sure enough, just as the Esquire article said, a "1" was composed of 700 Hz and 900 Hz tones together. A "2" was composed of 700 Hz and 1,100 Hz together. A "3" was 700 Hz and 1,300 Hz.</p><p>完全足够了，与《时尚先生》上的文章所言一致，“1”就由700Hz加上900Hz音调。“2”是由700Hz加上1100Hz。“3”即是700Hz加1300Hz。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I froze and grabbed Steve and nearly screamed in excitement that I'd found it. We both stared at the list, rushing with adrenaline. We kept saying things like, "Oh, shit!" and "Wow, this thing is for real!" I was practically shaking, with goose bumps and everything. It was such a Eureka moment. We couldn't stop talking all the way home. We were so excited. We knew we could build this thing. We now had the formula we needed! And definitely that article was for real.</p><p>我立即找到斯蒂夫，不禁兴奋地尖叫起来：我找到它了！我们看着那张表，兴奋地奔跑着，嘴里不停地说：“噢，太棒了！”“哇，这是真的！”我高兴得手舞足蹈。这是“我发现了”的兴奋时刻。回家的路上我们不停地谈论，欣喜若狂，并且确定可以做这件事，甚至有了初步的计划！这也证实了那篇文章是千真万确的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That evening I went to Sunnyvale Electronics and bought some standard parts to build tone generators like the ones in the article. Immediately I found a tone generator kit and brought it back to Steve's house. Right there I soldered together two tone generators. Luckily, Steve had built a frequency counter before this, so we were able to put them together, plus a device that let you turn a dial and measure the tone it produced. For example, I could turn one dial and measure until I got the tone to approximately 700 Hz frequency. Then I could turn the other dial until it got to 900 Hz. Finally I'd play both tones at once and record the sound for about a second on a regular cassette tape recorder. Remember, those tones together meant a "1." Then I did the right combinations for the other digits. Eventually we had a seven-digit phone number and even a ten-digit number recorded.</p><p>晚上，我就去阳光谷电子城购买一些文中发音器所需的标准零件。很快我发现了一套发音器器材，我将其买下带到斯蒂夫家。在那里，我将两个发音器连接一起。幸运的是，斯蒂夫在这之前已做好了一个频率盒，所以我们就能把它们连在一起，再加上一种设备，它能让我们辨别拨电话时的音调。例如，我可以调节其中一个，使其音调接近700Hz的频率。然后我又可以再调另一个到900Hz。最后我就可以两个同时播放，并将其录入磁带1秒钟。还记得这两种音调在一起就代表“1”吧。然后我调节出代表其他数字的音调。最终，我们录下了7位数字，甚至10位数。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> Finally we set a tone to 2,600 Hz, which is the high E note that supposedly seized the free line mentioned in the article. It worked!</p><p>最后我们调到2600Hz，也就是先前提到的可占据免费线路的高音。果真如此！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After dialing a free 555 long-distance information number, we heard that chirp the article had talked about. Then we presumed that the phone system was waiting for tones to tell it where to connect to. But uh-oh. We played the tones from our tape recording but we weren't able to get the call to go through.</p><p>我拨下555免费长途信息号码时，我们听到了文中所说的那种“唧唧”声。我们想电话系统已在开始等待着不同音调来告诉它接往何处。但遗憾的是，当我们从录音机里放出我们的音调，却不能接通。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Man, it was so frustrating. No matter how hard we tried to get the frequencies right, they wavered. I just couldn't make them accurate. I kept trying, but I just couldn't perfect this thing. I realized I didn't have a good enough tone generator to prove the article true or false one way or the other.</p><p>噢，这可真让人沮丧。无论我们多么努力去调准频率，它总显得摇摆不定，难以调准，不停地尝试仍难达到完美。我意识到我们的发音器还不够完善，也难以证明那篇文章的对与错。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But I was not about to give up.</p><p>但是，我并没有打算放弃。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The next day was my first day at Berkeley. I was involved with my classes - I thought they were great classes - but I kept thinking about the Blue Box design. I took that Esquire article with me and started collecting every article from Sunday papers I could find about phone phreaks. I started posting articles I found about them on my dorm room wall. I started telling my friends what these phone phreaks were all about, how intelligent they must be, and how I was sure they were starting to take over the phone system all over the country.</p><p>就在第二天我入读伯克利分校。进入班级后，我感觉到它的确很棒。但我仍在思考“蓝盒子”的设计。我随身携带《时尚先生》中那篇文章，同时还开始收集星期天日报上每一篇关于电话黑客的文章，并将它们张贴于宿舍的墙上。我告诉朋友们这些电话黑客是什么，他们如何聪明，以及我为何如此肯定他们已开始控制全国的电话网络。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So there I was at Berkeley, living in my little dorm room on the first floor of Norton Hall, my best school year ever. I could mesmerize an audience of kids with tales from this article and what Steve Jobs and I had been trying to do. I started gaining a reputation as the dorm's "phone phreak," which was fitting. Because one day I explored our dorm and found an unlocked telephone wire access box for our floor. I saw enough phone wires going up to the higher floors - there were a total of eight floors of dorm rooms, including my own above the common area - and I tapped pairs of wire and connected handsets to them. The idea was to</p><p>进入伯克利分校后，我住在诺顿宿舍的一楼，在这里度过了最为精彩的学校生活。我有着大群听众，当我描述文章中的故事以及我和斯蒂夫·乔布斯的一切尝试，他们都被深深吸引。我开始以“电话黑客”而声名鹊起，这再合适不过了。因为有天我在对公寓的考察中发现我们这层楼有个电话线接入盒没有上锁。我看见数条线接往上面的楼层，也包括我那一层。我拆开几对电线，接上听筒。但要决定的是哪条线接往哪个宿舍。所以我最后四处闲逛，接上任何我想接的电话线。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>determine for a fact which lines were the ones going to which dorm rooms. So I ended up being able to play around and find any particular phone line I wanted to.</p><p>尽管我通常都很害羞，不引人注目，但是，公寓里的每个人都在寻找一些奇闻趣事，而我就因为“电话黑客”事件，突然间在这里变得名声大震。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Even though I was usually shy and went unnoticed, suddenly this phone phreaking stuff brought me out to a position of prominence in my dorm, where everyone was seeking some sort of partying and fun.</p><p>就在这时，我又发现了另一种电话黑客盒子，叫做“黑盒子”。与蓝盒子不同的是，黑盒子不是让你免费打电话，而是每个打你电话的人都不用付费。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was around this time that I discovered another kind of phone phrealc box, called a "Black Box." Instead of letting you dial free numbers, like the Blue Box did, the Black Box meant anyone who called you wouldn't be billed for the call.</p><p>对黑盒子的最初了解是来自于阿比·霍夫曼的那本《窃书》（StealThisBook），一本我在普通商店得到的地下书籍。（他们将它放在柜台下，这样就没有人注意到它的标题。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I found the schematics for the Black Box in Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book, an underground book I somehow managed to get at a regular bookstore. (They kept it under the counter so no one would follow the order in its title!)</p><p>同一年里，一期《壁垒》杂志（Ramparts）图文并茂地介绍了如何建造黑盒子，且只需从无线电小屋购买约2美元的器材。你所需要的就是1个电容、1个电阻、1个开关或是按钮。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> That same year, an issue of Ramparts magazine came out with a really well-explained and completely illustrated article on how to build a Black Box with about two dollars' worth of parts from Radio Shack. All you needed were a capacitor, a resistor, and a switch or push button. Here's how it worked: when someone called you long-distance you pushed the button to briefly tell the local phone company that you were answering. This connected the faraway line to your own. Because you didn't answer for two seconds minimum, the local phone company didn't send back a billing signal. Yet you were still connected to the caller, and the capacitor of the Black Box allowed their voice to reach your phone (and vice versa) without the phone company sensing any sort of connection. This device worked very well. In fact, one pole-vaulter in my dorm got a letter one day from his parents wondering why they hadn't been billed for two calls from Florida.</p><p>其原理如下：当有人给你打长途电话时，你只按下按钮，当地电话公司就知道你在接听，而这却与你自己的线路相连。因为你接听未超过2秒，当地电话公司就不会发送计费信号。但你却仍与呼叫者通话。即使没有电话公司的连接，黑盒子中的电容能让你听到对方的声音（对方也能听到你的声音）。这套系统运作顺利。甚至有一次，宿舍一位撑高跳运动员的父母写信来询问，为何他们两次从佛罗里达州打电话来都没有收费。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By the way, the phone company sued Ramparts after the article ran and drove it out of business by 1975.</p><p>顺便告诉你们，这篇文章登出以后，电话公司起诉了《壁垒》杂志，并于1975年将其赶出商界。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So while I'm playing with Black Boxes and spreading the word about the Blue Boxes, I started to seriously go to work on my own design. Only this time I tried a digital Blue Box design, which I knew would be able to produce precise, reliable tones. Looking back, I see that it was just a radical idea to do a digital Blue Box. In fact, I never saw or heard about another digital Blue Box. Making it digital meant I could make it extremely small and it was always going to work because it was based on a crystal clock to keep it accurate. That's the same way, by the way, watch crystals keep your watch running correctly.</p><p>所以，当我把玩黑盒子，并宣传蓝盒子知识的同时，我开始认真进行自己的设计。这一时期，我致力于“数字蓝盒子”设计，它能发出更精确可靠的音调。现在回想，“数字蓝盒子”不过是我的基本构想。事实上，我从没见识或听说过“数字蓝盒子”。“数字”意味着我会把它做得极袖珍，由于有石英钟保证准确，它也会一直正常工作。你可顺便看看让你手表正常工作的石英，也是同样的道理。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I already had really good design skills by this point. I mean, I'd been designing and redesigning computers on paper all the way through high school and my last two years of college. I knew so much about circuit design, probably more than anyone I knew.</p><p>从这点来说，我已具备很好的设计技术。无论是高中还是大学的最后两年，一直以来我都在纸上重复设计电脑。我对电路设计的熟悉大概超过所有我认识的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And then one day I did it. I designed my own digital Blue Box.</p><p>终于有一天，我设计了自己的“数字蓝盒子”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was great. I swear to this day - the day I'm telling you this and the day you're reading it - I have never designed a circuit I was prouder of: a set of parts that could do three jobs at once instead of two. I still think it was incredible.</p><p>它很出色。今天让我告诉你们，我发誓我以下所言皆真，我从未设计过让自己如此自豪的电路：它能同时完成三项任务。我现在仍觉得不容置信。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>You see, the circuit, which generated codes corresponding to which button you pushed, used the chips in a very unusual way.</p><p>你瞧，这一电路让零件发挥出不同寻常的作用，你只需按下按钮就可得到相应音调。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The way all electronics works, including chips, is that some signals are sent to the electronics, to their inputs. And the resulting signals come out of the chip on connections called outputs. Now, because I was familiar with the internal circuitry of the chips, I knew that tiny signals were actually being emitted by the inputs. After those tiny signals went through my button coding circuit, I directed them to a transistor amplifier, which supplied power to turn the chips on. So you can see the amazing thing. (At least, you can see it if you're an engineer.) The chips had to supply a signal to turn them on, and they did. That signal came from one side of the battery being connected, but not the other side.</p><p>电子产品及其零件工作原理就是，信号进入它们的输入口，最终的信号再传入输出口。由于我对内部电路图很熟悉，我清楚那些信号实际上是从输入端发出。当这些信号通过电路时，我用晶体放大器提供能量让零件运作。所以你真应该欣赏一下这一杰作。至少，如果你是工程师，你该看看。零件需要信号指挥它们，信号则来源于与电池相连的一端，而非另外一端。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I never have been able to do anything this out-of-the-box in any of my designs in my career at Hewlett-Packard or at Apple. That's saying a lot, because my designs have always been noted for being out-of-the-box. But this was cleverer than anything.</p><p>在惠普和苹果公司的职业生涯里，我都没能做出如此另类的杰作。我的设计通常都被评价为“另类”，但都不及这件。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, I won't say that getting a Blue Box working was just an instant thing. That's not what happens in engineering. I was in school, taking classes, and it was probably a couple of months before I did this design. But once I designed it, building it took a day.</p><p>但我不认为会立即让“蓝盒子”运作起来，工程的发展并不如此。我还在学校上课，需要几个月后才能进行设计。但我一旦设计好，只花上一天就做好了它。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I brought it to Steve's house, and we tried it on his phone there. It actually worked. Our first Blue Box call was to a number in Orange County, California - to a random stranger.</p><p>我把它带到斯蒂夫家，我们在他的电话上试了试。完全正常。我们的第一个蓝盒子电话是打给加州橙县的陌生人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And Steve kept yelling, "We're calling from California! From California! With a Blue Box." He didn't realize that the 714 area code was California!</p><p>斯蒂夫一直不停叫嚷：“我们从加州打来！从加州。用一个蓝盒子。”他没有意识到714却是加州的区号。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Instantly we got in my car and drove up from Steve's house to the dorm at Berkeley. We had promised our parents, who all knew about the project, that we would never do it from home. That one call to Orange County would be the only illegal one from either of our parents' houses.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I wanted to do the right thing. I didn't want to steal from the phone company - I wanted to do what the Esquire article said phone phreaks did: use their system to exploit flaws in the system. These days, phone phreaks shun those who do it to steal.</p><p>我一心向善，不想从电话公司盗窃，而是想像《时尚先生》文中的电话黑客所说的那样：发掘系统中的漏洞。如今的电话黑客会回避将其用于盗窃的人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Also, I would've died to meet Captain Crunch, who was really the center of it all. Or any phone phreak; it just seemed so impossible that I'd ever meet anyone else with a Blue Box.</p><p>也许死后我才可以见到“嘎吱上校”（电话黑客的重要人物），或是其他电话黑客。似乎我总是很难与研究蓝盒子的人物相遇。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One day Steve Jobs called me and said that Captain Crunch had actually done an interview on the Los Gatos radio station KTAO.</p><p>有一天，斯蒂夫打电话告诉我“嘎吱上校”在加州洛思佳电台（KTAO）接受了采访。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> I said, "Oh my god, I wonder if there's any way to get in touch with him." Steve said he'd already left a message at the station but Captain Crunch hadn't called back.</p><p>我说：“噢，上帝，我真想知道有什么办法可以与他认识。”斯蒂夫说他已经在电台留言，但“嘎吱上校”还没回电。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We knew we just had to get in touch with this most famous - infamous, really - and brilliant engineering criminal in the world. After all, he was the guy we'd been obsessed with for months; he was the guy we'd been reading about and telling stories about. We left messages at KTAO but never heard back from Captain Crunch. It looked like a dead end.</p><p>我们知道都必须联系上这位世界上最著名、最杰出的工程罪犯，他也很臭名昭著。但毕竟，他是我们几个月来为之着迷的人，我们阅读他的传奇，讲述他的故事。我们在KTAO留下纸条，但却没有得到“嘎吱上校”的回音。事情似乎已成定局。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But then, the most coincidental thing happened. A friend of mine from high school, David Hurd, called me and wanted to catch up. When he came up to visit, I started to tell him all these incredible Captain Crunch stories and about the Blue Box and he said, "Well, don't tell anyone, but I know who Captain Crunch is." And I looked at him, floored. How could some random friend from high school know who Captain Crunch was</p><p>但就在那时，最为碰巧的事情发生了。我高中时的朋友大卫·赫德在电话中说要来看我。我也告诉了他所有“嘎吱上校”和蓝盒子的传奇故事，他却说：“我认识这位‘嘎吱上校’，但千万别告诉别人。”我目瞪口呆，一位高中时的朋友却知道“嘎吱上校”的身份。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I said, "What"</p><p>我说：“什么？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Oh yeah, he said, "I know who he is. His real name is John Draper and he works at a radio station, KKUP in Cupertino."</p><p>“是的，”他说，“我知道他是谁。他的真实姓名是约翰·德雷珀，在古柏蒂奴市（Cupertino）的KKUP电台工作。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The next weekend, I was sitting with Steve at his house and told him what I'd found out. Steve immediately called the station and asked the guy who answered, "Is John Draper there" He didn't even say Captain Crunch.</p><p>第二个周末，在斯蒂夫家我告诉他这一消息。斯蒂夫马上打给电台：“约翰·德雷珀在吗？”他甚至没提到“嘎吱上校”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the guy said, "No, he dropped out of sight after the Esquire article."</p><p>但接线人却说：“不在。自从他在《时尚先生》发表了那篇文章后就辞职了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hearing that, we knew we'd found the real Captain Crunch. We left our phone number with the guy just on the off chance that Captain Crunch might call us back. And in about five minutes, Captain Crunch actually called!</p><p>听到这一回答，我们确定的确找到了“嘎吱上校”。我们仍是留下了电话号码，抱着一线希望，“嘎吱上校”可能会回电。5分钟后，他的确打来了！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We picked up the phone, and he immediately told us who he was. But he said he didn't want to say much on the phone. (I remember how, in the Esquire article, he had seemed pretty paranoid, sure that the phone line he was talking to the reporter on was bugged.)</p><p>拿起电话，就听到他自报家门。但他说不想在电话上谈论太多。我还记得《时尚先生》的文章显示出他是那么偏执。显然他通话的线路受到窃听。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then we told him what kind of equipment we had, what we'd built. I told him it was a Blue Box that I myself had designed, and that it was digital. And he said, again, "Well, I can't talk on the phone about this, but I will come meet you in your dorm."</p><p>然后我们告诉他我们拥有的设备，完成的作品。我说那是自己设计的一个蓝盒子，并且是数字的。他再次提到：“嗯，我不能在电话谈论此事，但我会去你们的公寓。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Man, I drove back to Berkeley just shaking the whole way. When I got there, I was telling everyone who'd listen, "Wow! Captain Crunch is coming here!" This guy I had made into a superhero - the hero of technology bandits or whatever you'd call him - the head guy, the best-known guy, was coming to my dorm room! And everybody was saying, "Can I come"</p><p>我开车到伯克利分校，一路上手舞足蹈。我告诉每一个愿意听的人。“哇！‘嘎吱上校’要来了。”他是我的偶像，科技侠盗或是其他你喜欢的称号，他是博学的领军人物，而他就要到我的公寓来了！每个人都问我：“我能来吗？”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But I said, no, no, I knew Captain Crunch wouldn't like that. So it was just my roommate, John Gott, Steve Jobs, and I who sat there in my dorm room, waiting and waiting.</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, for some reason I was expecting this suave ladies' man to come through the door. I think it was because I'd read in the Esquire article that he'd tapped his girlfriend's phone line once and heard her talking to another guy, and then he called her up and said, "We're done." Just having a girlfriend, I guess, made him a ladies' man to me. I still had never even had a girlfriend.</p><p>因为某些原因，我很期待这会有女人缘的男人进入这扇门。可能是因为从《时尚先生》文中得知，他曾窃听女朋友的电话线路，却发现其与另一个男人相谈甚欢，然后他就打给她说：“分手吧。”他有女朋友，所以我猜想他可能是个有女人缘的人，因为我从未有过女朋友。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But no. Captain Crunch comes to our door, and it turns out he's just this really weird-looking guy. Here, I thought, would be a guy who would look and act just far away and above any engineer in the world, but there he was: sloppy-looking, with his hair kind of hanging down one side. And he smelled like he hadn't taken a shower in two weeks, which turned out to be true. He was also missing a bunch of teeth. (Over the years, the joke I made up about him was that the reason he had no teeth was that he was stripping phone lines with them when the phone rang. Engineers know that the phone ringing signal is a high enough voltage to shock you really hard.)</p><p>但与之相反。“嘎吱上校”却是一位长相古怪的男人。我想，他可能是一个外表与行为都与工程师相去甚远的人，但他却是：身体单薄，一边的头发垂了下来，闻起来仿佛2周都没洗过澡，最后证实的确如此，还缺了几颗牙齿。多年来，我一直这样笑话他，他没有牙齿是因为当电话响时，他用它们去把电话线剥开。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> So anyway, I saw him, and he didn't match my expectations. So I asked, "Are you Captain Crunch" And he said, "I am he," and he walked in just majestically. What a line that was. "I am he." And there he was.</p><p>不管怎样，他与我预料的样子毫不相符。所以我问：“你是‘嘎吱上校’吗？”他说：“我就是。”是的，他来了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He turned out to be this really strange, fun guy, just bubbling over with energy. And he's sitting on the bed, looking at all my phone phreak articles taped to my wall, and all the circuits and magazines, and also weird things like the twenty pounds of saltines I'd swiped from the cafeteria by stuffing a few packets in my pockets at every meal.</p><p>他是样子古怪却又风趣的人，而且精力充沛。他坐在床边，看着我墙上奇怪的电话黑客文章、杂志上的电路图以及我从自助餐馆偷来的20磅盐脆薄饼干——每顿饭后我都偷偷包起来放进口袋。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And he looked around and saw wires coming out of the telephones; I could tell he was surprised. I was sitting there thinking: Wow, this is the most amazing night of my life of all time, and it's just beginning!</p><p>他四处张望，还发现了电话连出的电线。可以说他很惊讶。我坐在那里心里暗想：哇，这可是我这一生中最惊喜的夜晚了。而它不过才刚刚开始。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>He started talking to us. I noticed he was kind of like one of these very hyper people who keep changing topics and jumping around, talking about different times in his life and different stuff he did. I kept trying to impress him with my Blue Box. I boasted about how small it was, how few parts it took, and how it was digital - that was the main thing. I told him there was just one thing, 1 hadn't figured out how to make international calls yet. And he showed me the procedure right away. Strangely enough, it was the same procedure we'd read about in the Esquire article, but it didn't work then, don't ask me why.</p><p>他开始与我们交谈。我注意到他是那种高度亢奋的人，不停地转换话题，跳跃性很强，描述生活中不同时期和不同的事情。我希望自己的蓝盒子让他印象深刻。我吹嘘它多么小、仅用多么少的零件还有它多么的数字化，这是最主要的。我说，我还不知道怎么拨打国际长途。他立即向我演示。不可思议的是，整个过程与《时尚先生》中如出一辙，但还是不行，我也不知道为什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then suddenly Captain Crunch said, "Wait, wait a minute. I am going to go out to my car now and get my automatic Blue Box."</p><p>然后“嘎吱上校”突然说：“等一分钟。我回车上把我的自动蓝盒子拿来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We knew right away that this was going to be some incredible piece of equipment that's going to be something special, like the digital Blue Box I'd designed. The way he said it - automatic. It was sort of a competitive thing.</p><p>我们马上想到这可能又是一个不可思议的设备，非常特别，就像我设计的数字蓝盒子一样。只不过他的是——自动的，极具竞争性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I had this image of what this van must look like -with everything he needed to seize phone systems and other stuff in it. I imagined racks of engineering equipment and telephone equipment based on what I'd read in Esquire.</p><p>我脑海里有了一副小货车的图像——里面有任何他用来控制电话网络的工具及其他设备。基于《时尚先生》，我能想象满架子的工程设备和电话设备。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So I asked him, "Can I come" I just had to see it. It was as if I'd be seeing history, like one of the Seven Wonders of the World.</p><p>所以我问：“我可以去吗？”我只是很想参观一下。这种心情像是去观看名胜古迹，比如古代世界七大奇观之类。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Well, I followed him out to the parking lot where his VW van was parked. It was completely empty. It was a totally empty van. All it had in it was this little Blue Box device on the floor, and a strange kind of crossbow-shaped thing, like a cross. It turned out that was the antenna he used to run San Jose Free Radio, a pirate radio station. He said the reason he ran it out of his van was so that no one from the FCC could ever pinpoint his location. Brilliant!</p><p>我跟着他去停车场。却发现车内完全是空的，一辆全空的小货车，仅有袖珍型的蓝盒子设备和一个弩形而类似十字架的东西。原来后者是他用于圣·荷塞免费电台的天线，那是个私人电台。他说不要在车内使用，因为这样美国联邦通讯委员就不能追踪到他的位置。真聪明！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So that was to his credit, but still, all this equipment I expected to see wasn't there, and then there were his looks, and the strangely empty van. Everything was starting to not add up all of a sudden. I started to feel queasy and uncomfortable standing there. My previous ideas about what phone phreaks were supposed to be like were not meshing with the person I was looking at. This was a technical scallywag.</p><p>但是，我希望见到的设备没在那里，只有他邋遢的样子和空空的小货车。突然间有种空落落的感觉。站在那里，我开始觉得想吐而不舒服。以前我想象的电话黑客与我眼前的人有着天壤之别。这是个科技痞子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then we went back to my dorm room and he took out this automatic box and showed me a few of its special abilities. The box had sliding switches - ten of them - to let you set up each of ten possible digits in a phone number. You could just push a button on the box - beep beep beep - and dial the whole number from there, no whistling or tone signals required! I was totally impressed by this, it was just really great.</p><p>然后，我们回到宿舍，他拿出自动盒子并给我演示它的特殊功能。盒子上一共有10个滑行开关，能让你拨打任何10位电话号码。你只需按盒子上的按钮——哔、哔、哔——就从那里开始拨号，不用口哨或其他方式发出音调。它太棒了，给我留下了极深的印象。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - O -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Later on, four of us -Steve Jobs, Captain Crunch, a guy named Alan McKittrick (who we called Groucho), and I - headed to Kips pizza parlor. We kept trading codes for dialing into various places and techniques like using Blue Boxes from pay phones.</p><p>之后，我、斯蒂夫·乔布斯、“嘎吱上校”、还有位叫做艾伦·麦基里克（我们都叫他格劳乔），一起前往奇普（Kip）比萨店。我们不停交流打电话到不同地方的秘诀，以及将蓝盒子运用于公用电话的技巧。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At around midnight, we said our goodbyes. Captain Crunch wanted to go over to Groucho's house first and then drive his van home to where he lived in Los Gatos. So Steve Jobs and I took Steve's car back to his house in Los Altos, where my Pinto was parked.</p><p>直至半夜我们才相互道别。“嘎吱上校”想先去格劳乔家，再开车回到他在加州洛思佳的家。所以，斯蒂夫·乔布斯用他的车载我回到洛斯阿尔托斯市的家，因为我的斑马车停在那里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Steve mentioned that his car had been having generator problems. When I asked what that meant, he said, "Pretty much the whole car can just suddenly shut down at some point."</p><p>斯蒂夫提到车的发动机有些问题。我问那表示什么，他回答：“差不多就是整部车在某一时刻会突然停下来。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>About halfway down, in Hayward on what was then Highway 17, as I recall, it actually happened. The car lost all lights and power. Steve was able to pull over to the right near an exit and we walked to a gas station where there was a pay phone. We thought we'd call Groucho - a long-distance number from Hay- ward - and ask Draper to pick us up on his way down south.</p><p>我还记得，当进入海沃市17干道，车就真的半路熄火了，无法启动，灯也熄了。斯蒂夫只能把它推到靠近出口的右边，我们就去加油站，那里有一台公用电话。我们决定打给格劳乔——从海沃打去可是长途电话，让他叫德雷珀南下时载我们一程。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Steve put a clime in the pay phone and dialed the operator. He told her he was about to make a "data call," to keep her from thinking that our line was going off the hook for the brief period while we used the Blue Box. He asked her to connect us to a free 800 number or long-distance directory assistance, some free call. Then we "blew it off" (seized the line with a 2,600 hertz tone) and Steve proceeded to use the Blue Box to call Groucho. But the operator came back on the line, so Steve hung up the phone quickly. This was not good!</p><p>斯蒂夫将10美分投入收费电话，拨给接线生。为了在蓝盒子使用时避免我们的线路中断，他告诉接线生，他将进行“数据通话”。他让她转接免费800号码或是另一地区的查号台，都是免费拨号。然后我们就“放置一边”（用2600Hz的音调占据线路），斯蒂夫用蓝盒子打给格劳乔。但接线生接回原线，所以斯蒂夫马上挂了电话。不太顺利！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We tried it again, telling the next operator that it was a data call and to ignore any weird light she might see. But the same thing happened. The operator came back on the line just before we made the connection. Again, Steve hung up instantly. We thought we were getting in deep trouble, that somehow our Blue Box had been detected.</p><p>我们再度尝试，告诉接线生这是“数据通话”并请忽略她可能看到灯的任何异常，但同样的事情还是发生。就在我们将连上时，接线生又接了回来，斯蒂夫又立即挂下电话。我们认为可能惹上了大麻烦，蓝盒子可能被发现了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Finally we decided to use coins and just call Groucho the legal way. We did and asked Captain Crunch to pick us up. All of a sudden, a cop pulled into the gas station and jumped out real fast. Steve was still holding the Blue Box when he jumped out, that's how fast it happened. We didn't even have time to hide it. We were sure that the operator had called the cops on us, and that this was the end for sure.</p><p>最终，我们还是决定用硬币付钱，合法地打给格劳乔。就在一瞬间，一名警察冲进加油站，快速奔向我们。而斯蒂夫那时还紧握着蓝盒子。我们甚至没有时间把它藏起来。接线生肯定通知了警察，所以才会发生以上一幕。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> The cop was kind of heavyset and walked past me for some reason, shining his flashlight on the plants about eight feet in front of me. I had long hair and a headband back then, so I guess he was looking for drugs we'd stashed. Then the cop started examining the bushes, rifling through them with his hands in the dark.</p><p>那位警察体格魁梧，总莫名地在我身边晃动，并用手电筒不停照射我面前高达8英尺的植物。那时，我留有长发，戴着头巾，所以我想他可能在搜寻毒品。然后他开始检查草丛。黑暗中他的手在草丛中穿来穿去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the meantime, trembling with fear, Steve passed the Blue Box to me. He didn't have a jacket on, but I did. I slid it into my pocket.</p><p>斯蒂夫此时战战兢兢地把蓝盒子递给我。他没穿外套，而我有。然后我就把蓝盒子顺手放进我的口袋里。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But then the cop turned back to us and patted us down. He felt my Blue Box and I pulled it out of my pocket and showed it to him. We knew we were caught. The cop asked me what it was. I was not about to say, "Oh, this is a Blue Box for making free telephone calls." So for some reason I said it was an electronic music synthesizer. The Moog synthesizer actually had just come out, so this was a good phrase to use. I pushed a couple of the Blue Box buttons to demonstrate the tones. This was pretty rare, as even touch-tone phones were still kind of rare in this part of the country then.</p><p>但是，就在那时警察突然转身，然后对我们拍身搜查。他触摸到我的蓝盒子，我不得不把它拿出来。我们还是被抓住了。警察问我那是什么。我才不会说：“噢，这是用于拨打免费电话的蓝盒子。”而我说它是一个电子音乐合成器。那时穆格电子音响合成器才刚刚上市，所以这可是个新鲜词汇。我按下蓝盒子的按钮，放出音调。因为那时接触式按键电话在这一地区还很少见，所以很少有人听见过这种音调。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The cop then asked what the orange button was for. (It was actually the button that sounded the nice pure 2,600 Hz tone to seize a phone line.) Steve told the cop that the orange button was for "calibration." Ha!</p><p>然后警察又问我橙色的键是做什么用的。（它其实是用于发出2600Hz的音调来占据线路。）斯蒂夫却回答是用于校准。哈哈！</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A second cop approached. I guess he had stayed back in the police car at first. He took the Blue Box from the first cop. This device was clearly their point of interest, and surely they knew what it was, having been called by the phone operator. The second cop asked what it was. I said it was an electronic music synthesizer. He also asked what the orange button was for, and Steve again said that it was for calibration. We were two scared young cold and shivering boys by this time. Well, at least Steve was shivering. I had a coat.</p><p>后来又来了名警察，可能他开始坐在车上。他从第一名警察那里接过蓝盒子。这一设备引起了他们的兴趣，他们肯定从接线生那里得知这是什么了。第二名警察也问了与前一名警察同样的问题。在那一刻，我们不过两个又冷又怕、不停颤抖的男孩。最后，斯蒂夫瑟瑟发抖，我也感冒了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The second cop was looking at the Blue Box from all angles. He asked how it worked and Steve said that it was computer- controlled. He looked at it some more, from every angle, and asked where the computer plugged in. Steve said that "it connected inside."</p><p>第二名警察从不同角度观察蓝盒子。他问它如何工作，斯蒂夫说由电脑控制。他又从每一角度看了一遍，再问哪里可以连接电脑。斯蒂夫说“在它里面。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>We both knew the cops were playing with us.</p><p>我们俩都明白警察不过在愚弄我们。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The cops asked what we were doing and we told them our car had broken down on the freeway. They asked where it was and we pointed. The cops, still holding the Blue Box, told us to get in the backseat of their car to go check out the car story. In the backseat of a cop car you know where you are going eventually: to jail. </p><p>警察问我们在干什么，我们回答说车在高速公路上坏了。他们想知道在哪里。我们就指了指。他们仍拿着蓝盒子不放，让我们坐进警车的后座，去确定我们以上所说是否属实。坐于警车的后面，你就知道自己将有的归宿——监狱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The cops got in the front. I was seated behind the driver. The cop in the passenger seat had the Blue Box. Just before the car started moving, or maybe just after, he turned to me and passed me the Blue Box, commenting, "A guy named Moog beat you to it."</p><p>警察坐前面，我在驾驶座的后面，副驾驶位上的警察掌管蓝盒子。就在车子启动或是稍后，他转过身来把蓝盒子还给我，并说道：“穆格（Moog，早期声音模拟合成器的发明者，创办了用自己名字命名的公司，并在电子合成器方面取得了巨大的成就，编者注）会因为它扁你的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>How Ma Bell Helped Us Build the Blue Box</p><p>大贝尔如何帮助我们制造蓝盒子</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In 1955, the Bell System Technical Journal published an article entitled "In Band Signal Frequency Signaling" which described the process used for routing telephone calls over trunk lines with the signaling system at the time. It included all the information you'd need to build an interoffice telephone system, but it didn't include the MF (multifrequency) tones you needed for accessing the system and dialing.</p><p>1955年，《在宽带信号频率中发信号》（In Band Signal Frequency Signaling）一文发表于《贝尔系统技术杂志》（Bell System Technical Journal），文中描述了如何将信号系统运用于干路上电话线路的再建立。它还提到了建立办公室间电话系统所需的所有信息，但没有提及进入系统以及拨号所需的多频音调。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But nine years later, in 1964, Bell revealed the other half of the equation, publishing the frequencies used for the digits needed for the actual routing codes.</p><p>但就在9年以后，即1964年，贝尔揭示了此项工程剩下的一半，公布了实际线路中数字所使用的频率。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, anybody who wanted to get around Ma Bell was set. The formula was there for the taking. All you needed were these two bits of information found in these two articles. If you could build the equipment to emit the frequencies needed, you could make your own free calls, skipping Ma Bell's billing and monitoring system completely.</p><p>因此，一切都已公之于众，任何想逃过大贝尔收费系统的人都可利用。方法就在那里等着你。你所需要的就是掌握这两篇文章中的信息。如果你能建立设备，发出需要的频率，你就可以打自己的免费长途电话，完全躲过大贝尔的收费和监测系统。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Famous "phone phreaks" of the early 1970s include Joe Engressia (a.k.a. Joybubbles), who was able to whistle (with his mouth) the high E tone needed to take over the line. John Draper (a.k.a. Captain Crunch) did the same with the free whistle that came inside boxes of Cap'n Crunch. A whole subculture was born. Eventually Steve Jobs (a.k.a. Oaf Tobar) and I (a.k.a. Berkeley Blue) joined the group, making and selling our own versions of the Blue Boxes. We actually made some good money at this.</p><p>20世纪70年代早期，著名的电话黑客有乔·恩格里西亚<sup>(绰号为乔巴珀)</sup>，他用嘴就可吹出高音口哨来控制电话线路。还有约翰·德雷珀（绰号为“嘎吱上校”）用Cap’nCrunch牌麦片盒里的口哨也能发出同样的高音。一个群体应然而生。最后，我（绰号为蓝色伯克利）和斯蒂夫·乔布斯（绰号为笨拙拖把）也加入其中，我们制造并售卖自己版本的蓝盒子，也因此而财源滚滚。</p></div>
