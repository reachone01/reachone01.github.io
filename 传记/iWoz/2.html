<div class='layout'><p>The Logic Game</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I did a lot of reading at night when I was a kid, and one of my absolute favorites was the Tom Swift Jr. series. I would just  eat up those books so quickly; new issues would come out a couple of times a month and I'd devour them. I don't think it  would be exaggerating at all to say he was truly my hero.</p><p>当我还是个孩子时，总喜欢在深夜看书。我最钟爱的是《小汤姆·史威夫特》系列。我看得很快，尽管一个月出好几期，我却总是狼吞虎咽地看完。毫不夸张地说，他在我心中是真正的英雄。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, Tom Swift Jr. was this kid - a teenager, actually -older than me but still a kid like me. So I looked up to him. And he  was also a scientist/engineer who got to build things in a laboratory. Anything Tom wanted he could build, and he had his dad  to help him with tilings. He'd go in and hook wires together and make contraptions at a company he and his dad owned. So Tom  had his own company, he had his own modes of travel, and he had his best friend named Bud Barclay. Anyway, in my opinion, Tom  Swift Jr. had the perfect life. And whenever there was a crisis on Earth, any kind of conflict that needed handling, he  sprang into action. Say the authorities on Earth had detected some alien energy source and the only way to hold it back would  be with a plasma field. Well, Tom Swift Jr. would build a plasma field. He could build a submarine if he wanted to. There was  no limit to what he could build. I remember once he built a spaceship to win a race around the Earth to get the money to do  something good -you know, something good for the planet and all the people on it.</p><p>汤姆·史威夫特也是个孩子，确切的说是个青少年，比我大一点，但像我一样，仍旧是个孩子。因此，我向他看齐。他也是一位在实验室里搞创造的科学家，也可以说是位工程师。汤姆会去做自己想要的任何东西，还可以得到父亲的帮助。他进入实验室将线接在一起，再到他和父亲的公司做出装置。所以，汤姆有自己的公司，自己的工作模式，还有最好的朋友巴德·巴克利（BudBarclay）。总之，在我眼里，汤姆·史威夫特有着完美无缺的生活。当地球遭遇危机，当有争端等待解决，无论何时，汤姆都会开始行动。比如当地球官方侦查出一些外星能量源，等离子区就是能抑制它的唯一方法时，汤姆·史威夫特就会建立一个等离子区。只要他想，也可以建出潜水艇。什么都可以，毫无限制。我还记得，有一次他建造了一艘太空船，赢取了全球比赛而获得奖金，他用来做了一些很好的事情——一些有益于地球和人类的事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That was the kind of thing I wanted to do - build something that would end up allowing me to do something really good for  people. I wanted to be a do-gooder from the start, just like Tom Swift Jr. was.</p><p>这也是我想做的事——一些能让我对人类有真正贡献的事情。从一开始，我就想成为一个贡献者，就像汤姆·史威夫特一样。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Well, my mom set a curfew at 9 p.m. every night. But after she turned the lights out, I used the light from this little  streetlight outside my window to read. It hit my floor in one certain space. I would put the Tom Swift Jr. book down there on  the floor where the light shone in, then put my head over the edge of the bed so I could read it late, late into the night. I  wanted to be just like Tom Swift Jr.</p><p>我母亲在每晚的9点都有“宵禁令”。但在她关上灯后，我常借助窗外的街灯开始阅读。灯光恰好照在地板的一处，我就把《小汤姆·史威夫特》放在那儿，然后从床上伸出头来开始阅读，直到深夜。我多想成为和汤姆·史威夫特一样的人啊。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And like Tom Swift Jr., I did work with my dad a lot on projects. In fact, my very first project - the crystal radio I built  when I was six -was really all because of my dad. It took me a very long time in my life to appreciate the influence he had on me. He started when I was really young, helping me with these kinds of  projects.</p><p>和汤姆·史威夫特相同的是，我也与父亲一起完成诸多工程。事实上，6岁时，我完成了第一件杰作——一部半导体收音机，这都归功于父亲。父亲的影响让我终身受益。从我很小开始，父亲便培养我完成各种各样的工程。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>My Hero</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Tom Swift Jr. was the hero of a whole series of children's adven-ture novels published by the same people (Stratemeyer Publishing) that did the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys titles.</p><p>汤姆·史威夫特是这一系列儿童冒险小说里的英雄人物，均由斯特拉特迈耶（Stratemeyer）发行，以南希·德鲁（NancyDrew）和哈代男孩（HardyBoys）命名。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>James Lawrence, who said he had a deep interest in science and technology, was the author of most of the titles. I mentioned  Bud Barclay already, Tom Swift Jr.'s best friend, but the stories had other elements in common. Anyone who's read them may  remember dastardly spies from Eastern European countries like "Brungaria," and an amazingly capable element called  "Tomasite," which could make anything atomic-powered.</p><p>詹姆士·劳伦斯（Jameslawrence）是大多数故事的作者，他说自己对科技兴趣浓厚。我曾提到的巴德·巴克利，是汤姆·史威夫特最好的朋友，除此之外这些故事还有许多其他共同点。任何读过的人都会对卑鄙的东欧间谍印象深刻，就像“保鲁加利亚”（Brungaria），还有一位具有超能力的角色叫做“汤姆赛特”（Tomasite），他能让所有事物都自动化。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>One famous plot - I believe it was in book 22 -involved scientifically regenerated dinosaurs. That was decades before  Jurassic Park.</p><p>其中，最有名的情节莫过于恐龙重生了，那可早在《侏罗纪公园》拍摄前几十年。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>My dad's and my relationship was always pretty much about electronics. Later, it became about what I did as an engineer  working at Hewlett-Packard on calculators, or on the first computers I built at Apple. But first, for years and years, it was  all about what Dad did in engineering. I watched, listened, and worked with him. It was about how fast he could show me  things and how fast I could learn them.</p><p>在电子学上，父亲对我影响深远，无论我作为惠普的计算器工程师，还是我在苹果公司创造第一台电脑，都与他有着紧密联系。但最初的那么多年都与父亲在工程上所做的工作相关。我边看边学，并与他一起工作。他教多快，我就学多快。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Dad was always helping me put science projects together, as far back as I can remember. When I was six, he gave me that  crystal radio kit I mentioned. It was just a little project where you take a penny, scrape it off a little, put a wire on the  penny, and touch it with some earphones. Sure enough, we did that and heard a radio station. Which one, I couldn't tell you,  but we heard voices, real voices, and it was just so darned exciting. I distinctly remember feeling something big had  happened, that suddenly I was way ahead - accelerated - above any of the other little kids my age. And you know what That  was the same way I felt years later when I figured out how resistors and lightbulbs worked.</p><p>父亲总是帮助我把各种科学工程融为一体。在我记忆里，父亲在我6岁时送给我刚刚提及的那一套晶体管收音机工具。那不过是一个小工程，你拿来硬币，稍微刮掉一些，再将电线放在上面，最后连上耳机，这样就够了。我们完成后还收听到了广播。虽然我不记得是哪个台，但我们的确听到了声音。那一刻简直是激动人心，我感受到那是我生命中的重要时刻，突然间，我就在同龄人中出类拔萃了，而且以加速度成长。这种感觉至今记忆犹新。几年后当我了解电阻和电灯如何工作时，也有着相同的感受。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But now I had actually built something, something they didn't have, a little electronics thing I had done and none of them were able to do. I told other kids in the first grade, "I built a crystal radio," but no one knew what I was talking about. None of them. I felt at that moment a kind of glimmer that I might have a lead in things like this from then on. Does that sound crazy But after building that little crystal radio and telling everyone about it, I knew I had done something most people would think was hard and few kids my age had done. And I was only six. I thought: Okay. That's done. What else can I do?</p><p>我真的创造了一些别人做不出的东西，一些其他孩子不会做的电子小产品，当我告诉其他一年级孩子“我做了一个晶体管收音机”，却没人知道我所言何物时，我突然感到一片曙光。听起来很疯狂吗？但自从我完成晶体收音机，讲述给每一个人听之后，我就知道那些事情大家都认为很难，而且很少同龄小孩可以做到。当时我只有6岁，心里想着：太好了，完成了！我还可以做些什么呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It's funny, because ever since that crystal radio project when I was six, I've spent a lot of time trying to explain my designs and inventions to people who didn't know what I was talking  about. So this has happened and keeps happening to me over and over. Even now.</p><p>有意思的是，自从做了晶体管收音机，我就开始用大量时间向人们解释我的设计和发明，周而复始，直到现在。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>All through elementary school and through eighth grade, I was building project after electronic project. There were lots of  things I worked on with Dad; he was my single greatest influence.</p><p>经过小学8年的生活，继电子工程后，我建立了自己的工程。我与父亲完成了无数杰作，对我而言，只有他对我影响至深。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the fifth grade, I read a book called SOS at Midnight. The hero of the book was a ham radio operator, and all his friends  were ham radio operators. I remember how they sent each other messages with the ham radio and when, after the main guy got  kidnapped, he was able to beat the kidnappers by cleverly rewiring the TV a little and sending out a signal to his friends.  The story was okay -it was just a story. But what really got me was the fact that there were people who used these ham  radios to speak to each other long distance -city to city, even state to state. Now, this was a time when it was hard for me  to imagine even making a long-distance phone call you could actually afford. Ham radio was the most effective way to reach  out to people in faraway places without leaving home - and cheaply. This was something that much later led to my phone  phreaking (using special tones to make free long-distance calls) and then to my use of the ARPANET, which later evolved into  the Internet we have today.</p><p>五年级时的某个午夜，我读了一本叫做《SOS》的书。书中的英雄是位业余无线电操作者，他的朋友都与他兴趣相投。他们用无线电给彼此发信息。当主人公被绑架后，他聪明地将电视接上电线向他的朋友发送求救信号，从而大败歹徒。故事很精彩，但那不过是个故事，真正吸引我的是有人将业余无线电运用于远程通话——城市之间，甚至是州与州之间。那个时候，我甚至很难想象打一个长途电话，即使费用上负担得起。业余无线电让你足不出户便可联系上远方的人们，这是一种有效又便宜的方法。这也为我后来借用电话线路而埋下伏笔（用特殊线路打免费长途电话），然后我还利用ARPANET网络（美国国防部高级研究计划局建立的计算机网），它后来就演变成了今天的互联网。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The other thing - the special thing -was on the last page of SOS at Midnight. It said how to become a ham radio operator. It  said you can become a ham radio operator at any age. All you had to do was contact the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) for  more information.</p><p>那本午夜的《SOS》还写到另一件特别之事：如何成为业余无线电操作员？其中写道，你可在任何年龄成为业余无线电操作员，仅需要与美国无线电传播联盟（ARRL）联系获取更多信息即可。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I went to school the next day and told my buddy on safety patrol, "I'm going to get a ham radio license!" I was really  boasting, because no one back then knew what I was talking about.</p><p>第二天，在学校与伙伴安全巡逻时，我告诉他：“我就要得到业余无线电执照了。”我实在有些自我吹嘘，因为那时没人知道我在说什么。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Ham Radio Making a Difference</p><p>业余无线电可是晦涩难懂的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To this day, ham radio is popular all around the world. It's a hobby. Ham radio amateurs use their two-way radios to talk to  each other, share information, and just have fun.</p><p>如今，业余无线电作为一种业余爱好已举世闻名。业余无线电爱好者们使用两用电台相互通话、共享信息或仅供娱乐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But it's more than a hobby. From the start, ham radio operators performed a public service in protecting the airwaves from  radio pirates, and being extremely ethical about how they used public airways.</p><p>但它不仅仅是业余爱好。最初，业余无线操作员提供公共服务，旨在保护电视广播免受无线电盗版，对于如何使用公共波道，他们也极其道德。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Many ham radio operators from the early days have gone on to make significant contributions to society. There is a lot of  practical applicability in the building and use of ham radio. I'm a good example.</p><p>很早以前，许多业余无线电操作员就为社会做出巨大贡献。在建立和使用业余无线电中有着许多实践，我就是一个好例子。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Ham radios were pretty obscure. But this kid I told, he said, "Oh, you know, there's this guy down the street, Mr. Giles, and he's teaching a class on this. Are you in it" So this was really lucky. I remember being astounded. It turned out that on Wednesday nights Mr. Giles -who actually was a ham radio operator - had these classes I could take. I learned Morse code there, I learned some of the electronics calculations I needed, I learned what frequencies ham radio operators were allowed to use. Basically, I got to learn all the stuff that was going to be on the test you had to take to be a licensed ham radio operator. My dad saw what I was doing, and he got his license with me. We both took the test and passed when I was in the sixth grade. And for that Christmas, I got kits to build a Hallicrafters transmitter and a Halli- crafters receiver. In today's money, it probably cost a couple thousand dollars. That's a lot of money to spend on a sixth grader. And building the radio transmitter and receiver was a lot of work! You had to unpackage hundreds of parts. I had to learn to solder for that, too. In fact, I soldered together the wholething. We also had to go up on the roof and string antennas of a certain length, to be right for the signals I needed. This was the beginning of learning the kinds of things I would need later to design and assemble computer boards like the one that later became the Apple I.</p><p>听我吹嘘的小伙伴对我说：“你知道吗？这条街上有位贾尔斯先生（MrGiles）正在教这门课。你在听课吗？”真是太幸运了，我大吃一惊。周三晚上我就去听课了。贾尔斯先生实际上就是一位业余无线电操作员，正在授课。这一课程让我学到了莫尔斯电码和一些我需要具备的电子学计算，还知道了业余无线电操作员可使用哪些频段。基本上，我已掌握了所有业余无线电操作员执照考试的知识。父亲一直关注我所做的事情，还和我一起拿了执照。六年级时，我们共同参加考试并通过。作为圣诞礼物，我得到一套霍里（Hallicrafters）工具用来建发射机和接收器。按现在计算，那大概要花上二千多美元。对六年级生来说，这是很大的一笔花费。我拆开数百个零件，还得学着焊接。事实上，我把它们整个都焊接了起来。我们还得到屋顶去将天线调节到适当长度，以便接收我需要的信号。这些最初学到的东西，成为了我此后设计和组装电脑主板（比如后来的“苹果Ⅰ”）的必需知识。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I loved my transmitter and receiver. They were such standouts in ham radio quality - these days, I even see these models  featured in radio museums and collectors' magazines. I didn't really get into talking to the other ham radio operators - they  were so much older than me and we really didn't have anything except for the ham radios in common. So after building it, I  have to admit the whole thing got a little boring. But this experience was a major one. For one thing, I'm fairly sure I was  one of the youngest ham radio operators in the country. That was huge for me. But even more importantly, I learned all about  the process of getting a ham radio license -what I needed to know, what I needed to build the equipment - and then I built  the radio. It gave me a lot of confidence for doing all kinds of other projects later on.</p><p>我钟爱我自己发射机和接收器，它们在业余无线电装置中的品质数一数二，至今还能看到无线电博物馆和收藏家的杂志里以此为招牌。那时我未曾与其他业余无线电操作员真正交谈过，因为他们年龄长我太多，而且，我们只有一点相通，那就是业余无线电。因此建造之后，我不得不承认事情变得有点无聊，但这段经历仍很重要。首先，我能完全确定我是全国最年轻的业余无线电操作员，对我而言这意义重大，但更重大的是，我从拿执照的整个过程中所学的一切——以创建设备所需要的知识及技能——然后我就完成了电台制作。这一成功赋予了我极大的信心投入到此后的其他工程中。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So my dad ended up being a key influence here, too. I mean, he even got his ham radio license with me -studying with me and  taking and passing the test! The thing is, he never really tried to lead me in any direction or push me into electrical  engineering. But whenever I got interested in something he was right there, always ready to show me on his blackboard how  something worked. He was always ready to teach me something.</p><p>我的父亲也在此起到了关键作用。他甚至与我一起拿到业余无线电的执照——与我一起学习和通过考试。其实父亲从未有意引导和帮助我进入电子工程的天地。但是，无论何时我对事物产生兴趣，他都会在那里，一直准备着用他的小黑板向我演示它们如何工作。他总是时刻准备着教给我一些东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A Little More About the Transistor</p><p>晶体管小知识</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The transistor will likely go down as one of the greatest inventions in modern history, ranking right up there with the car,  the telephone, and Gutenberg's printing press. William Shockley and his team at Bell Labs invented the transistor in 1947.</p><p>晶体管可能是现代史上最伟大的发明之一了。汽车上、电话里以及古登堡印刷机内，处处都有它的身影。它由威廉·肖克利（WilliamShockley）和他的团队于1947年在贝尔实验室发明。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Put most simply, a transistor is a tiny electronic device to control the flow of electricity. But a transistor is more than  that. It has two key abilities: the first is to amplify an electric signal, and the other is to switch on or off (1 or 0),  letting current through or blocking it as necessary.</p><p>简而言之，晶体管是一种控制电流运动的微小装置，但又不仅仅如此。它有着两个主要作用：其一，增强电子信号；其二，可处于开或关（1或0）的状态，必要时让电流通过或是阻断。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Transistors are in practically all modern electronics these days, from musical birthday cards, to your car, to your personal  computer. Since 1947 - and this is what has made the computer revolution possible -it has become cheaper and cheaper to pack  more transistors onto a computer chip every year. (This is known as Moore's Law, which Intel founder Gordon Moore defined in  the 1960s. He said that every year manufacturing would get so good that double the number of transistors would be able to fit  on a chip for the same price.)</p><p>从音乐生日卡到汽车，再到个人电脑，实际上，晶体管如今充斥在现代电子学的方方面面。自1947年以来，植入电脑芯片的晶体管一年比一年便宜，这让电脑革命成为了可能。（这被称之为摩尔法则，由英特尔创始人戈登·摩尔20世纪60年代定义。他指出，制造业的好势头年年保持，以致于两倍数量的晶体管植入电脑只需花费以前费用的一半。）</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A simple logic gate comprises about twenty transistors, compared to an advanced computer chip in a modern (circa 2006)  computer, which can include as many as a billion transistors.</p><p>简单的逻辑门大概包括20个晶体管，与之相比，现代电脑（2006年左右）的高级芯片包含的晶体管高达10亿个。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>My mom really pushed me along, too. In the third grade, when I started doing math flash cards at school, my mom practiced multiplication with me the night before we'd have to do them in school. And as a result, in school I was the only boy whocould beat the girls at them. I remember a teacher said, "Wow, that's incredible. I never had a boy before who could beat the girls at flash cards." And again, that was high praise. Girls always seemed to get better grades than boys, I thought. And then I thought: Whoa. My gosh, I'm good at something -math - and I'm going to work harder at it. And I worked harder and harder to try to always be the best, to try to always be ahead. That's what really put me ahead at such a young age, this drive to keep my lead. I had a teacher in both the fourth and fifth grades, Miss Skrak, who really praised my science projects, like I was the smartest kid in the class because I knew science so well. As you'd predict,</p><p>我母亲也对我帮助颇多。三年级时，当我开始在学校做数学卡片游戏时，妈妈与我在前一个晚上练习乘法。结果我成了学校里在数学卡片游戏上能战胜女孩子的唯一男孩。记得有位老师说：“哇，真是难以置信。以前我还从未遇到哪个男孩玩这个游戏胜了女孩子呢。”那是很高的评价。我认为女孩子们玩卡片游戏总是比男孩子稍胜一筹。那之后，我就认为：哇！我擅长数学，我要更努力地学习它。于是我越来越努力，尽量保持名列前茅。这才是让我在这么小的年龄便出类拔萃的真正动力，它驱使我保持第一。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I accelerated even more later on. In sixth grade I was doing electronics projects most kids never figure out how to do even  in high school-level electronics. So I was very lucky with all my teachers, especially Miss Skrak. She came along at just the  right time in my life.</p><p>思可可小姐是我四五年级的老师，她高度赞扬我的科学工程，仿佛就因为我懂得科学便成了班中最聪明的孩子。亲爱的老师，正如您所预言，不久我就飞速成长。六年级时我就做出了大多即使有着高水平电子学的孩子也不能做出的工程。我很幸运遇到我所有的老师，尤其是思可可小姐。她恰好在我生命中最需要她的时候出现。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At about this time, there was another lucky accident. I found this article about computers in one of the old engineering  journals my dad had hanging around. Back then, back in 1960, writing about computers wasn't common at all. But what I saw was  an article about the ENIAC and a picture of it. The ENIAC - which stood for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer -w as the first true computer by most people's definition. It was designed to calculate bomb trajectories for the military  during World War II. So it was designed back in the 1940s.</p><p>那一时期，还有一份意外幸运——我在父亲闲置的旧的工程期刊上，发现了一篇讲述电脑的文章。在1960年，这样的文章非常罕见。但是，我却看到一篇有关ENIAC并附了图片的文章。ENIAC代表着ElectronicNumericalIntegratorAndComputer（电子数字积分计算机），被许多人定义为第一台真正的电脑。二战期间，人们设计出它，在军事上运用于计算弹道。因此，它设计于20世纪40年代。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This journal had all kinds of pictures of huge computers and articles describing them. These computers were unlike anything  I'd ever seen. One picture showed a big round tube that looked like a TV tube. And the article explained that the round tube  was where these huge computers stored data. It used phosphor lights and then it could read if the phosphors (lights) were on  or off - just like the digits 1 and 0 on today's computers can be interpreted as On or Off - and then it could reset them  quickly. This, the article explained, was actually a way to store data, and I was just intrigued by that idea. I was about  eleven years old at the time.</p><p>这本期刊刊登着各种各样巨型电脑的照片并附文描述。那些电脑不同于我以前所见的任何事物。一张照片显示了一个类似电视显像管的巨大圆形管，文章解释说这就是巨型电脑储存数据的地方。它用的是一种磷灯，当磷灯处于开或关时，它就能读出（就如现在的电脑将数字1或0理解为开或关一样），然后它又很快重置。文章说道，这实际上是一种储存数据的方式，我对此产生了强烈兴趣。而那时我只有11岁。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Suddenly I realized that some incredible things were just starting to happen with computers at these very early stages. Of course, they were nowhere near the point of making computers affordable or usable for the world. They weren't even talking about a point where anyone could buy a computer and put it in your house and learn how to use it yourself. I thought that would be just the best thing, and that was the dream -The Dream, Ihave to put that in capital letters - because it was the single force that drove me for years afterward. How to make The Dream come true. I thought about that constantly.</p><p>在那一刹那，我就意识到这些初级电脑会开始产生难以置信的变化。当然，那时世界上还没有地方做出人们能够负担并且便于使用的电脑。更无人谈及，买台电脑放在家里，自己学会如何使用的问题。我认为那将会是最美好的事情，这是我的梦想。这个梦想，我将其放于首位，因为它是驱使我多年努力的唯一动力。“如何让美梦成真”是我坚持不懈地思考的问题。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There were so many incredible things happening with computers at that time, and I would never have known about them if I  hadn't been too shy to do anything but read magazines at my house. The amazing thing was that at this early stage in my life,  I'd managed to find this journal Dad had with this stuff in it. This was a magazine most people were never supposed to see or  even be interested in because it was targeted to high-level government engineers.</p><p>那一时期，电脑发生了如此之多难以置信的事情，如果我不是因为太过害羞而整天在家阅读杂志，我将永远都不知道。惊讶的是那时我还很小，我竭尽所能地找到父亲那些包含这些内容的期刊。这种书大多数人都从未看到或毫无兴趣，因为它瞄准的读者群是政府高级工程师。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After that, I was addicted. I started reading and rereading this journal and others my dad had. I remember one day finding an  article on Boolean algebra. That's the type of mathematics computers use. And I learned about De Morgan's Theorem, which is  what Boolean algebra is based on. And that's how logic became the heart of my existence, there in the fifth grade. I was  learning that formula and figuring out how to use it so I could swap ANDs and ORs in logic equations. In logic, for instance,  you might ask if a word starts and ends with a vowel. Well, then the formula would be an AND - there's a vowel at the  beginning and a vowel at the end. That's AND in Boolean algebra. But what about a word that starts with a vowel but doesn't  end with one, or the other way around, but not both That's an OR statement in Boolean algebra.</p><p>从那以后，我沉溺于此，并开始反复阅读这类杂志。记得有一天我发现一篇讲述布尔代数的文章，这是电脑所用到的一种数学。我从中学习到笛摩根定理，而布尔代数则以此为基础。因此，五年级时，逻辑成了我知识体系中的核心部分。我学习方程及其运用，这样我就可以在逻辑方程中替换“与”和“或”。例如，在逻辑运算中，如果一个词既以元音开始又以元音结束，那么方程就是“与”——开始与末尾都是元音。这就是布尔代数中的“与”运算。但如果一个词以元音开始却未以此结束，再或者相反呢？这就是布尔代数中的“或”运算了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And in this journal they had diagrams of AND gates and OR gates and I copied them, learning to draw them the standard way.For instance, a half-moon shape with a dot in the middle represents an AND gate. If it has a plus sign in the middle instead of a dot, it's an OR gate. Then I learned how to draw a picture that represented an inverter -it's a triangle pointing to the right with a little tiny circle at the very end of its tip. What's funny is, I use these very same symbols when I design electronics to this day,and I learned all this in my room with these journals in front of me on my bed in fifth grade.</p><p>这些杂志中还有“与门”和“或门”的图表。我复制下来，学着以标准方式画出它们。例如，一个半月图形，中间加上一点就表示“与门”。如果以加号代之，则是“或门”。然后我还学习了如何表示变极器——一个顶朝右的三角形，顶端再画上一个小圆圈。有趣的是，我至今还将相同的标志运用于自己的电子设计中，而它们却是我五年级时于卧室床前所学会的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Here's what was amazing to me back then. I thought to myself: Hey, at my current level of fifth-grade math, I am able to  learn the math used by a computer鈥擠e Morgan's Theorem, Boolean algebra. I mean, anyone could learn Boolean algebra and they  wouldn't even need a higher level of math than I already had in fifth grade. Computers were kind of simple, I discovered. And  that blew me away. Computers -which in my opinion were the most incredible things in the world, the most advanced technology  there was, way above the head, above the understanding, of almost everyone - were so simple a fifth grader like me could  understand them! I loved that. I decided then that I wanted to do logic and computers for fun. I wasn't sure if that was even  possible.</p><p>以下才是那时让我惊讶的事情。当时我自己想着：嗨，以我如今五年级的数学水平，就能学着将数学运用于电脑了——笛摩根定律和布尔代数。任何人都可以学习布尔代数，而他们不会需要比我五年级时更高的数学水平。我发现电脑很简单，这让我勇往直前。电脑——我认为世界上最难以置信的产品，有着最先进的科技，几乎超过所有人所能理解的范围，而我这个五年级学生却认为它容易理解！我爱上这种感觉，决定以后从逻辑和电脑中找到乐趣。我甚至不确定那是否可能。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To say you wanted to play with computers in those days, well, that was so remote. It was like saying you wanted to be an  astronaut. It was 1961; there weren't even real astronauts yet! The odds of being one seemed really slim. But logic was  different. I could see that it just came so easily for me. And it always would.</p><p>那时你若想玩电脑，几乎不太可能，就如你想成为宇航员一样困难。事实上，1961年还没有宇航员呢！两者机会同样渺茫，但逻辑则不同。我总觉得它很简单，并且会永远如此。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>So that's how computers became the heart of my life straight through. As a matter of fact, computer logic was something I  eventually became better at than probably any other human alive. (I can't be sure of that, of course. Maybe there were really  high- up people in colleges who were as good at applying De Morgan's Theorem in their heads.) But by the time I designed the  first Apple computer, logic was my life. I know it sounds unbelievable, but I just loved logic and everything about it, even  back then.</p><p>这样，电脑便成了我生活中的重心。实际上，我成了世上最擅长于电脑逻辑的人（当然我不能完全确信，也许有些大学里的高人很擅长思考怎样应用笛摩根定律）。但直到我设计出第一台苹果电脑时，逻辑仍是我的生命。我知道这听起来难以置信，但是当时，我的确着迷于逻辑以及一切与之有关的东西。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I was in elementary school and junior high at a time when science projects were cool -when you weren't strange if you did one, and you got celebrated if you won an award. So I got celebrated a lot. My science fair projects are some of the things I am still proudest of. We're talking third, fourth, fifth, sixth, andeighth grades here. (For some reason, I didn't enter a project in the seventh grade.) And these projects were hard, harder than kids many grades ahead of me could ever pull off, and I knew it even then. I put some science projects together that, for that audience of kids and judges, just blew their minds. I was like a hero, and I won all kinds of awards, including top honors at the Bay Area Science Fair.</p><p>上小学和初中时期时，科学工程对我意味着“酷”——如果你做过，人们对你就不再陌生，如果获取奖项，人们都会祝贺你，因此我总是接受祝贺。我的那些漂亮的科学工程至今仍让我引以为豪。我们这里讲了3、4、5、6、8一共5个年级。（因为某种原因，我在七年级时未能参与工程）这些工程难度很大，大过许多比我高年级的孩子能进行的工程，我也清楚这一点。我将一些科学工程放在一起，显示并解释给伙伴们和裁判们。我就如英雄般凯旋，赢得各种各样的奖品，其中包括湾区科学大奖赛的最高荣誉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The science fairs gave me the feeling of what I was and could be in the world, just by entering something good in a science  fair. The teachers recognized something different about me immediately; some of them even started calling me Science Whiz  because I had all these great projects in the science fairs. And probably as a result of that, by sixth grade I was doing  electronics projects few people in high school could even understand yet. Those kinds of acknowledgments and those kinds of  achievements made me want to keep working at those tilings until they would be my things in the world.</p><p>科学大奖赛让我感受到自己的角色以及此后在世界上的角色，而我仅需要用自己的较好作品去参加就会收获良多。老师们立即认识到我的与众不同。因为科学大奖赛上那些成功的工程，一些老师甚至叫我“科学迷”。也许正因如此，我在六年级就在做一些连高中生甚至都还不懂的电子工程。各种各样的认可和成就让我坚持自己所做的事，直到它们成为我的成就。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>My first science competition was in third grade, and I won. But the project was pretty simple, really. Basically I put  together this little contraption with a light and a couple of batteries and a little wire - all mounted on a piece of wood.  It was a working flashlight! A lot of people were surprised by that, and I won. No big deal, it turns out, because I felt  inside it wasn't really that impressive, and I knew I would do even better the next time.</p><p>我在三年级时第一次参加科学竞赛并且获胜，但那项工程实际很简单。基本上我就是把这些小装置和一盏灯、一对电池以及一点电线全部安在一张木板上，就成了一个闪光灯！许多人都惊讶于此，然后我就取得胜利。这并没有什么，因为在我心里那很平常，而且我知道下次会做得更好。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It was in the fourth grade that I did the first project that really taught me about things I would need later -physics, electronics, and the project materials. It was an experiment to see what would happen if you dipped these two carbon rods into any liquid of your choice. The carbon rods were connected by a wire to a lightbulb and an AC plug. By dipping the carbon rods into the liquid, the liquid in effect became one of the "wires." It could either act as a good wire or a bad wire - that is, it could conductelectricity well or it could conduct electricity poorly. If the light- bulb glowed, brightly or dimly, you could see how well the liquid could conduct electricity.</p><p>四年级时，我做了第一项让我以后受益匪浅的工作，从中我学到许多——物理学、电子学和工程材料。那是一个实验，用以检测，当你将两根碳棒沾取任何液体后会发生什么。而碳棒是通过电线与电灯及交流电插座相连。沾上液体后的碳棒因为液体的作用而成为了“电线”。它既可是好“电线”，又可是坏“电线”，也就是它既可很好地传导电流，也可很弱地传导电流。根据灯光的明暗，你就能知道液体传导电流的强弱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I used every liquid I could get my hands on -water, Coca-Cola, iced tea, juice, beer. Which liquid conducts electricity  best (The answer turned out to be salt water.) This is an extremely important thing to know if you want to understand, for  instance, hydroelectric machinery or even just plain old batteries.</p><p>我使用过每一种能找到的液体——水、可口可乐、冰茶、果汁和啤酒等等。哪种液体传导得最好呢？</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But the next experiment, man, that was a big one. What I did was build this giant real-life electronic model representing  what each of the ninety-two atoms in the periodic table looks like in terms of its electrons.</p><p>之后的一个实验，才是真正的大实验。我建造了一个巨大的电子模型，在周期表上向人展示92种元素的原子中电子的状态。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In case you don't remember, electrons orbit the center of an atom in much the same way planets orbit the sun. The Earth, for  instance, has a different orbit than, say, Neptune.</p><p>如果你不记得，那我告诉你，电子绕原子中心呈轨道运行，就如行星围绕太阳一样。例如，地球和海王星就有着完全不同的轨道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>My project aimed to demonstrate, with the click of a switch, how many electrons orbit each atom in the periodic table, and  which orbit around the nucleus they should be in. For instance, if I hit the switch for hydrogen, one light would turn onA in  the orbit nearest the center of the hole, which represented the nucleus.</p><p>我的工程旨在用开关的滴答声来演示有多少电子在周期表上围绕着同一原子核运动，而原子核周围又有着多少轨道。例如，我打开氢的开关，离代表原子核的小孔中心最近的轨道就会有灯亮起，</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To pull off this project, I had to drill ninety-two holes in a big aluminum sheet. The holes were located toward the bottom;  each one would hold one switch corresponding to each element. One switch would be for hydrogen, one for gold, one for helium,  and so on.</p><p>为了这项工程，我必须在1张大铝皮上钻上92个孔，全部到底。每一个孔都要让开关与每一种元素相连。有的是氢，有的是金，有的是氦等等。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Now, I painted a very large picture resembling a bull's-eye target -concentric circles in different colors, with a tiny  target in the middle to represent the center of the atom, which is the nucleus. And I had to drill ninety-two holes into the  big orbit picture, several in each orbit, corresponding to where the electrons could be in an atom.</p><p>然后，我画了一副非常巨大的图画，类似公牛眼大的靶子——各种颜色的同心圆，中间的小靶心代表原子的中心，即原子核。我还不得不在其上钻上92个孔，许多都在同一轨道，与原子中的电子相对。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The end result was this. Ask me to show you the electrons for any of the ninety-two natural elements. Let's say oxygen. I would hit the oxygen switch, and the eight lights representing the eight electrons that rotate around the oxygen atom would turn on, all in the proper orbits.I knew what the proper orbits were because I'd used this big reference book called The Handbook for Chemistry and Physics.This project ended up getting terribly complicated, because by the time I was dealing with all ninety-two elements I was stuck with dealing with ninety-two different sets of switches.</p><p>结果便是，我可以向你展示92种自然元素中的任意一种的电子。我们先说说氧吧。我打开氧的开关，代表围绕氧原子核运转的电子的8盏灯就会亮起来，全都在正确的轨道上。那时我知道正确的轨道该在哪儿，因为我使用了一本大型参考书，叫做《理化手册》（The Hand book for Chemistry and Physics）。这项工程最终变得相当复杂，因为那时我要对付所有92种元素，以及92种不同设置的开关。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That got so tough I finally had to use the information my dad taught me about the diode, which is the first electronics part  I ever learned about, really. Unlike a resistor, a diode is a one-way street. You can send electrons - that is, electricity  --just one way. Electricity can go through, but it can't come back through. If you try, it will short everything out. And  this was a problem because I'd gotten to the point where if I tried to turn on some middle- level element and its electrons,  I wound up with a feedback path that ended up turning on a bunch of lower elements and extra electrons that really didn't  belong there. Anyway, I needed a solution, and that's how I learned all about diodes.</p><p>最后我不得不用上父亲教我的二极管知识，也就是我曾学习的第一种电子零件知识。与电阻不同，二极管宛如一条道路。你可以用它传递电子——也就是电流——但仅有一条道路，电流可以通过，但不再回来。如果你要试着让电流返回，它就会让所有电路短路。这就是我所面临的问题。因为，当我尝试打开某个中间元素和它的电子时，却出现一个反馈路径让人激动地打开了一串下级元素和一些并不属于那儿的电子。不管怎样，我需要解决这个问题，而那也让我学会了有关二极管的一切。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Along with this huge display, I also displayed a large collection of elements. You know, jars of beryllium, pieces of copper,  even a bottle of mercury. I got a lot of these samples just by asking a professor at San Jose State to donate them to me.</p><p>在这场演示中，我还展示了收集的大量元素，包括铍制广口瓶、铜片，甚至一瓶水银。我的许多样本都是由圣·荷塞州的一位教授捐赠给我的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And yes, I won. First place. Blue ribbon. And that was cool.</p><p>是的，我又赢了。第一名，蓝色带子。真是很酷。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But it wasn't the most important thing. Looking back on it now, I see this was an amazing learning experience, just classic. My dad guided me, but I did the work. And my dad, to his credit, never tried to teach me formulas about gravitational power and electric power between protons, or stuff like what the force is between protons and electrons. That would have been waybeyond what I could understand at that point. He never tried to force me to try and jump ahead because I wouldn't have learned it. I wasn't ready for that level of knowledge.</p><p>但这并不是最重要的。现在回头想想，我会把它作为一次惊奇的学习之旅，不过很是经典。父亲引导我，然后由自己完成。而父亲出于信任，从未尝试教我一些有关重力和质子间电力的公式，或是类似于此的质子与电子之间的力，这些都超出了我当时的理解能力。父亲从不试图强迫我跳跃前进，因为很多知识我还没有学过，而且还没准备达到那样的知识水平。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In sixth grade, small step by small step, I learned how to build AND and OR gates, the basic building blocks of computer  technology. Digital circuits figure everything out - and I mean everything - based on what is on (Is) and what is off (Os).</p><p>六年级时，我学习如何建立“与门”和“或门”，这是电脑技术的基石。数字电路能辨识一切——我所谓的一切是以“开（1）”和“关（0）”为基础的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I was really getting into logic. My dad had helped me understand the concept of logic earlier by using the classic paper- and-pen tic-tac-toe game. This game, if you understand the logic, you will never, ever lose. That's what I based my next  project on: the tic- tac-toe machine. The machine I built would never, ever lose. It is so totally a logic game, but it is  also a psychological game because you can beat someone who thinks they can never be beaten. If the X is here and the other X  is over there, what should the outcome be This plywood was covered with parts and it was a huge project. And having a huge  project is a huge part of learning engineering - learning anything, probably.</p><p>我的确对逻辑运算着迷。很早时父亲就曾通过纸、笔、井字游戏来帮助我理解逻辑的概念。如果你懂得逻辑，在游戏中就会永远不败。这后来成了我的下一项工程：井字游戏机器。我所构建的机器从来也不会输。那完全是个逻辑游戏，但也是个心理游戏，因为你能打败所有自以为是的人。如果这儿有一个X，其他地方又有另一个X，结果是什么呢？这块夹板布满了零件，这可是个巨大的工程，而实施这样的工程是学习工程学的重要部分。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Doing long, long jobs that aren't just some real simple quick thing like a flashlight, but things that take weeks to build,  really demonstrates that you've mastered something great. Like, for instance, creating a computerized tic-tac-toe machine  that really works by logic.</p><p>做一项长期工作并非简单迅速得像闪光灯一样，而是需要好几周的时间投入进去，这会真正展示出你已精通的某些知识。例如，创造一台逻辑运行兼计算机化的井字游戏机器。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Unfortunately, though, the system didn't win. It blew up. What I mean by blew up is, the night before the competition, some  of the transistors started to put out smoke. Obviously something was wrong. I knew it was going to take forever to find out  what piece of equipment had blown and there was no way I was going to be able to do this in time for the contest. What a  disappointment, because I like to win. I always, as early as I can remember, wanted to be the best at things. And I often  was, as luck had it.</p><p>然而，不幸的是，这次我却没有胜利。机器出问题了。比赛前的晚上，有些晶体管开始冒烟，显然有零件出了问题。我知道总能找到发生故障的设备，但已来不及参加竞赛。出于对胜利的期待，我倍感遗憾。从小我便希望自己做到最好。而我也的确能做到，真是幸运。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But I also thought at the time that it didn't mean as much tome at that point, just winning the science fair, because I knew, and my dad knew, that I had actually built this fairly complicated logic machine and it worked.</p><p>当时我就认为，这不过是一场科学大奖赛，没有更为重大的意义。而且我和父亲都清楚，我已完成了一台相当复杂、运转正常的逻辑机器。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I mean, even as a kid it was obvious to me what the important thing really was. I said to myself, Look, showing someone an  award from a science fair is not as important as knowing you already have the award somewhere at home. And that's not as  important as having earned it, even if you don't have the award at home at all. And that's not as important as the most  important thing: that you've done the learning on your own to figure out how to do it. I did that learning on my tic-tac-toe  machine, and it was very, very close to being done and complete. I'm still proud of it. For me it's the engineering, not the  glory, that's really important.</p><p>换句话说，尽管我还是个孩子，但已经知道什么才是真正重要的东西。我对自己说：比起向别人展示科学大奖赛的奖品，知道自己的成果足以赢得奖品更为重要。关键在于，你自己学习并找到制作的方法。我就是完全在自己的学习过程中完成了井字游戏机器的，而且做得很精密，我至今为此骄傲。对我来说，重要的是工程，而非荣誉。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> - o  -</p><p></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Okay, so I'd built that tic-tac-toe system basically by putting together electronic gates. The idea was to put the gates  together into a system of transistor circuits that would never let you beat it. And as I said, I came up with the rules by  playing all possible games.</p><p>因此，通过将电子门放在一起，我就创建了井字游戏系统。将电子门连在一起形成一个吸引人的晶体管电路系统，便是我的想法。正如我所说的，各种各样的游戏让我发现规则。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But in the eighth grade I did something altogether different. I came up with a machine I called the Adder/Subtractor. This  would be the closest thing to an actual computer I'd ever designed. I can say this because I designed it so it would do  something -you could add or subtract numbers, and the result would show up on an electric display - but also because it  wasn't made up of just a set of logic gates like the tic-tac-toe machine. Addition and subtraction are logic, just like tic- tac-toe; based on inputting Is and Os, you can calculate what Is and Os come out.</p><p>八年级时，我所做的事情完全不同于以往。我把新成果称为“加减法机器”。除电脑之外，这是我设计过的事物中最精密的一种。这是因为它可以将加上或减去数字的结果显示在一面电子显示屏上，也因为它并不像井字游戏机一样是由一套逻辑门所构成。加减法都属逻辑，就像井字游戏一样，输入多个1和0，你就能计算出多个1和多个0的结果。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Adder/Subtractor wasn't more complicated in terms of size or construction time than the tic-tac-toe machine, but this project actually had a goal that was closer to real computing. A more important purpose than tic-tac-toe. We're taught to addand subtract in school, but nobody teaches you tic-tac-toe. It's not that important. Adding numbers could put a man on the moon; tic-tac-toe couldn't.</p><p>在建造规模和时间上，这台加减法机器都并不比井字游戏机复杂，但这项工程的目标更接近真正的计算，远胜于井字游戏机。每个人都在学校学习到加法和减法，但却没有人教井字游戏，因为它没那么重要。加减数字可以将人类送上月球，但井字游戏却做不到。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>My project had a function, a real function that was useful. You could input numbers, add or subtract one, and see your  answer.</p><p>我的工程有一种功能，一种真正有用的功能。你可以输入数字，再加上或是减去一个数字，然后可以看到答案。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>This Adder/Subtractor was about a foot square. I had a plastic board filled with holes and store-bought connectors I could  plug down into the holes to form connection points. I plugged the connectors in where needed and soldered transistors and  other parts to them.</p><p>这台加减法机器大约一平方英尺大小。我在一块塑料板上钻满孔，再将商店买来的连接器插入洞中形成连接点。我在需要的地方插入连接器，再把晶体管和其他零件与之焊接。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I had ten little switches to represent Os and Is, and another set of switches to represent more than 0s and Is. So if you  wanted to add 3 plus 2, on one row you would have to toggle the right-most two switches (which is equivalent to 0000000011,  the binary number representing 3) on the top row. Then, to represent 2,1 had to toggle the next to last switch to the right  on the bottom row. In binary, that is 0000000010. The answer would show up in lights, the lights I had attached. In this  example, two lights would be on -representing 0000000101, which represents 5. This would all be assuming that you had the  Adder/Subtractor-. in "add" mode instead of "subtract" mode. </p><p>我用10个小开关代表0和1，其他开关则不仅仅代表它们。所以，如果你想做3加2，在一排里你就必需拴牢最高一排最右边的两个开关（这等于0000000011，二进位数字就代表3）。然后，再拴牢最底下一排右边倒数第二个开关，这就代表2。在二进制里，就是0000000010。结果将以我所连接的灯光的形式显示。这个例子中，有2盏灯会亮——代表了0000000101，也就是5。同样的道理，可以让机器完成减法的运算。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What was impressive about this was that I knew so many levels of  electronics, logic, binary number theory, soldering, and all the experiences of my life so far just added up. I could explain  to judges how binary numbers worked, how you added and subtracted them, and then I could explain how gates were made of  diodes and transistors. I would then show the right combination of gates that made a one-bit adder (something that could only  add 0 and 1). I could show them a simple modification I did that could do subtraction as well. I also told the judges how I'd  solved a nonworking problem in the electronics of a gate, switching from resistors to diodes. That's real electronics know- how.</p><p>此次经历中印象深刻的是，我运用了电子学、逻辑运算以及二进制理论，我还使用了焊接，我已将所有经验都融会贯通、综合运用了。我会解释二进制如何运作，其中如何运用加减法，然后我再解释二极管和晶体管如何构成门电路。其后我还会展示如何正确组合门电路形成单字节加法器（只能加0和1），并且经我简单修改，还可做减法。我还告诉裁判们自己解决了一个门电路之外的问题，就是将电阻转换为二极管使用。那才是电子学中真正的“知道如何做”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On the one board were ten Adder/Subtractor circuits side byside handling carries and borrows (remember arithmetic) so you could add or subtract larger numbers - any number up to 1,023.</p><p>一块板上有10个并排的加减法机电路来操作进位和借位，因此你就可以加或减大点的数字了，但要在1023以内。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But here's the thing. I took it down to the Bay Area Science Fair one night, to set it up before the day of judging. Some  people showed me where to put it and asked me if I'd like to tell them about it. I told them no, figuring that I'd just tell  them the story on judging day. By then Id gotten kind of shy. Looking back, I think I may have turned down the judges without  knowing it.</p><p>其中有个插曲。在湾区科技大奖赛前一个晚上，我将自己的作品带去调试。有几个人告诉我展位，并问我是否愿意向他们介绍一下我的作品。我拒绝了，决定只在比赛当天才将故事一一道来。那时，我会有些害羞。现在回想，我猜自己也许因此让裁判们失望了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When I showed up on judging day, all the projects already had their awards. The judging had already happened somehow! I had  an honorable mention, and there were three exhibits that had higher awards than mine. I saw them and remember thinking they  were trivial compared to mine, so what happened I then looked in the fair brochure and those three projects were all from  the school district that was putting on the fair.</p><p>当我于大赛当天现身时，几乎所有工程都已获得奖品。真不知道是如何评判的！我被光荣提名，但有三项展品拿到比我更高的奖励。我观察它们，心里想着比起我的作品，它们真是微不足道。这是怎么回事？然后我在大赛册子里发现这三项都是由学院选送的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>I thought, Hey, I've been cheated. But that night, I showed the machine and talked to lots of people -including, I'm sure,  the real judges - and it seemed like they really understood how big my project was. I mean, it was great and I knew it and  eveiyone knew it. I was able to explain how I'd used logic equations and gates and how I'd combined gates and transistors  with binary number (Is and Os) arithmetic to get the whole thing working.</p><p>我觉得自己被骗了。但那晚，我向很多人展示了自己的机器并与他们交谈——我甚至觉得包括那些裁判——他们似乎也真正理解了我的工程有多么了不起。这样我就能解释自己如何运用逻辑方程式和门电路，以及我如何连接门电路和晶体管，再以二进制算术让整个机器运行起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After that, the Air Force gave me its top award for an electronics project for the Bay Area Science Fair, even though I was  only in eighth grade and the fair went up to twelfth grade. As part of the award, they gave me a tour of the U.S. Strategic  Air Command Facility at Travis Air Force Base. And they gave me a flight in a noncommercial jet, my first-ever flight in any  plane. I think I might have caught my love for flying then.</p><p>之后，空军颁发给我湾区科学大奖赛的电子工程最高奖项，尽管我还只是个八年级学生，而参赛者年龄最大的已经十二年级。作为奖品的一部分，我有机会到特拉维斯空军基地参观美国战略空军指挥部。我还有机会享受一次非商业化喷气机的飞行，那可是我第一次坐飞机。我想那一刻我已迷上飞行。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When I look back, that Adder/Subtractor was such a key project in my getting to be the engineer who ended up building the first personal computer. This project was a first step to that. Itwas a large project, for one thing, involving more than one hundred transistors, two hundred diodes, and two hundred resistors, plus relays and switches. And it performed a function that was useful: addition and subtraction.</p><p>如今回头看，加减法机器在我通往工程师的路上至关重要，成为我后来创建第一台个人电脑的起点。这是项大工程，首先，其中涉及一百多个晶体管，二百多个二极管以及二百多个电阻，另外还有继电器和开关。它的有效功能是加法和减法。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>And thanks to all those science projects, I acquired a central ability that was to help me through my entire career:  patience. I'm serious. Patience is usually so underrated. I mean, for all those projects, from third grade all the way to  eighth grade, I just learned things gradually, figuring out how to put electronic devices together without so much as  cracking a book. Sometimes I think, Man, I lucked out. It seems like I was just pointed in such a lucky direction in life,  this early learning of how to do things one tiny little step at a time. I learned to not worry so much about the outcome, but  to concentrate on the step I was on and to try to do it as perfectly as I could when I was doing it.</p><p>这些早期的工程磨练了我的耐心，这一点意义重大。从三年级到八年级的大多数工程中，我学到的东西越来越多，很多时候，我不用参考任何书籍就知道如何将电子设备连接在一起。有时，我对自己说，嗨，你可真幸运。早期学习一步一个脚印，仿佛为我指出了生命中的幸运方向。我学会不在乎结果，只在乎过程，尽力做好当下的事情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Not everyone gets this in today's engineering community, you know. Throughout my career at Apple and other places, you always  find a lot of geeks who try to reach levels without doing the in-between ones first, and it won't work. It never does. That's  just cognitive development, plain and simple. You can't teach somebody two cognitive steps above from where you are - and  knowing that helped me with my own children as well as with the fifth graders I taught later on. I kept telling them, like a  mantra: One step at a time.</p><p>当今工程学界并非每个人都明白这点。不论我在苹果公司还是其他地方，总会发现许多傻瓜，他们总想一步登天，而这是行不通的，从来如此。显而易见，这就是认知的过程。作为老师，你不能以自己的水平为准，企图让学生一步到位——这有助于教育自己的孩子以及一些五年级学生。我不断告诉他们：一步一个脚印。</p></div>
