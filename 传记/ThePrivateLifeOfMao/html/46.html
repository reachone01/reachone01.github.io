﻿<div class='layout'><p>46</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Women became even more important to Mao after one of them discovered the secret bugging devices. It happened not long after Chinese New Year, in February 1961, when we were en route to Guangzhou on Mao's special train.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Wang Dongxing seemed to know from the beginning that the trip would bring trouble. More women than usual were accompanying Mao. “When you put two women together, they are noisier than a gong,” Wang said to me just after we had set out.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>In addition to the female train attendants, the young confidential clerk who was so open about her liaison with Mao was there, and so was the woman with whom Mao had quarreled because she wanted to get married. I was startled to see a teacher I knew well there, too, and even more shocked to learn of her longtime liaison with Mao. The kind and honest young teacher had met Mao at one of his dances, and the two had struck up a relationship then. She had never been further from Beijing than the Fragrant Hills, and Mao had invited her along to show her the world.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The wife of a high-ranking military official, a dark-skinned, depressed-looking woman of about forty, was also there. She was said to have known Mao in Yanan. He had sent her off to the Soviet Union when their romance faltered and later arranged for her to marry the military official. Jiang Qing had long known about the romance and vengefully wanted the woman's husband demoted. But the man was a close associate of Peng Dehuai's, and so long as Peng remained minister of defense, the military official was protected. But when Peng was purged in 1959, that protection was gone, and Jiang Qing had begun pressuring Lin Biao to take action against the official. The wife, obviously anxious and unhappy, had come to persuade Mao to intercede on her husband's behalf.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao called her into his compartment several times while we were traveling, and on the first night after our arrival in Hangzhou I could not help but notice that she spent several hours there. Just after she left his room, though, she disappeared. One of the other women became worried and asked me to help find her. The woman was not found until early the next morning. She and Mao had quarreled, and she had spent the night huddled on a rock by the lake, crying. Mao sent her back to Beijing that day.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>After a few days in Hangzhou, we headed west by train toward Wuhan, stopping briefly so Mao could meet with Zhang Pinghua, Hunan's first party secretary.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The meeting took place on the train, and Mao was late.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He was lingering in his compartment with the female teacher while Zhang and his deputy, Wang Yanchun, waited in the adjacent reception car. Wang was so rooted in his peasant ways that he squatted rather than sit on the sofa. When Mao finally emerged, I joined the teacher and several of his other female companions for a stroll outside the train. Liu, the young technician responsible for secretly recording Mao's conversations, joined us in our meanderings.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>“I heard you talking today,” the young technician suddenly said to the teacher, interrupting our idle chatter.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>“What do you mean you heard me talking?” she responded. “Talking about what?”</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>“When the Chairman was getting ready to meet Zhang Pinghua. You told him to hurry up and put on his clothes.”</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The young woman blanched. “What else did you hear?” she asked quietly.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>“I heard everything,” Liu answered, teasing.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The woman was stunned. She turned and bolted for the train as the rest of us followed quickly behind. The other women were also distressed. If Liu had heard one conversation with Mao, surely he had heard others as well.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao's meetings were concluding as we returned to the train, and the teacher went immediately to his compartment, demanding to speak with him. She reported the entire conversation with Liu.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao was livid. He had never suspected the bugging. The revelation came as a shock. He called Wang Dongxing into his compartment, where the two stayed behind closed doors in intense conversation for an hour. Wang, so recently returned from exile, claimed not to know about the bugging devices, either. When he emerged from the meeting, he ordered the train to proceed immediately, at top speed, to Wuhan.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>As the train sped north, Wang called the technician Liu and confidential secretary Luo to meet with him, informing them that the Chairman wanted to know who had ordered the bugging. Wang claimed that since this was the first trip he had taken with the Chairman since his return, he simply took all the staff members who ordinarily accompanied the Chairman, including the recording technician. Wang began interrogating the young men and told Liu that Mao had ordered his arrest.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>But Wang did not arrest the technician. “You have no place to run,” he told him. But he demanded to know who had ordered the bugging.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Confidential secretary Luo pleaded ignorance. He said the bugging had started when Ye Zilong was in charge. Ye was the man to consult. But Ye was away doing labor reform.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Liu also claimed not to know. He was just doing his job, he said, acting under orders from “the leadership.”</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>“And did the leadership order you to record the Chairman's private conversations, too?” Wang Dongxing demanded, glaring at the young technician. “Don't you have anything better to do? Why were you looking for trouble? Why didn't you tell Chairman you wanted to record his talks? You recorded all sorts of things you never should have. What am I supposed to tell Chairman?”</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Liu was speechless.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>By the time our train reached Wuhan and we had settled into the Plum Garden guesthouse, it was four o'clock in the morning. Wang Dongxing and Liu roused a local electrician and went immediately to remove all the bugging equipment from the train. I went to bed.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>When I woke that afternoon, the bugging equipment—recording machines and tapes, speakers and wires—had been put on display in the conference room, and the staff was gathered around examining the paraphernalia. The Plum Garden guesthouse had also been bugged, and that equipment was on display, too. Mao ordered photographs taken as evidence, with Wang Dongxing, Kang Yimin, Luo, and Liu standing behind the table.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Kang Yimin, the deputy director of the Office of Confidential Secretaries who had worked just under Ye Zilong, had come from the General Office in Zhongnanhai to discuss the matter with Wang Dongxing. Kang was a simple, honest, but uneducated man, and he and Wang quickly came to blows. Kang knew that the real decision to record the Chairman's conversations had come from higher up than Ye Zilong. Bugging the Chairman was far too serious a matter to be decided by Ye. Why they—or I—ever thought it could be gotten away with, I will never understand.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Confronted with Mao's discovery and not wanting to bring unknown higher levels into the dispute, Kang wanted Wang Dongxing to find some convincing way to explain the whole thing away. But Wang was determined to find out where the order had originated. Mao wanted an investigation, and Wang Dongxing was determined to conduct it.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>In the end, though, the two men compromised. Wang Dongxing agreed to tell Mao that the bugging had been ordered to provide material for a party history.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao was infuriated. “So they're already compiling a black report against me, like Khrushchev?” he bellowed. A “party history” based on bugging his private conversations could only be used against him, and nothing bothered him more than the possibility of the type of attack Khrushchev had launched against Stalin. The attack against Stalin had also been full of damaging personal detail, and Mao did not want the details of his own personal life recorded on tape.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>But it was not these revelations he most feared. His private life was an open secret among the party elite. His greatest fear was the potential threat to his power. Mao's frequent travel to other parts of China, where he met alone with local leaders, was part of his political strategy, a tactic designed to leap over the cumbersome bureaucratic machinery of the party and state and to maintain direct contact with local-level leaders. He did not want the central authority to know what he said to the provincial and local-level leaders. His role as the source of all policy would be diminished were representatives to carry his words back to Beijing, where central leaders could devise policy based on his conversations outside the capital. Mao wanted the central authorities to be more directly dependent on and loyal to him. If they knew what he said when traveling, they could pay lip service to their loyalty without having to be dependent. That was what he was trying to avoid.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He ordered Wang Dongxing to burn the tapes immediately. “Don't leave a single one,” he commanded. “I don't want them providing material for any black report.” Faced with Mao's fury, Liu confessed that other places, including the Wangzhuang guesthouse in Hangzhou that we had just left, were also bugged. Mao ordered Wang to dispatch a team to remove that equipment and destroy those tapes, too.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Several people lost their jobs as a result of the incident. Ye Zilong's lieutenant Kang Yimin and Mao's confidential secretary Luo were both fired. Kang went to work in the People's Bank. Luo was transferred to the Second Ministry of Machine Building and was replaced by Xu Yefu, the confidential secretary who had earlier lost his job when he talked openly about Li Yinqiao's accusation that Jiang Qing was running away to Hangzhou to avoid being criticized. Liu, the witless technician whose teasing of Mao's girlfriend had precipitated the discovery, was sent to Shaanxi for labor reform.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao never believed that the underlings who lost their jobs in 1961 were the real culprits. “They don't understand what this is all about,” he said. “They don't know anything.”</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao, like Kang Yimin, believed that the orders to listen in on his conversations could have come only from leaders at the highest level. The Ministry of Public Security would have to be involved, too. Mao was convinced that they had been spying on him as part of a plot. His growing belief that there was a conspiracy against him within the highest ranks of the party dates from here. The differences between Mao and the other party leaders were still hidden, but the rift that would explode with the Cultural Revolution was quietly widening. Mao was biding his time.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao was unnerved by the bugging incident. Ordinarily suspicious, he had still never imagined that secret recording devices had been picking up his every word, that tapes of his conversations were being sent back to the central secretariat in Beijing. Nearly as shocking to Mao was the behavior of his personal staff. He assumed that his inner circle, in whom he had placed his trust, who had served him most loyally and longest, had been part of the plot. He knew we were aware that his conversations were being recorded and sent to the central secretariat. But we had kept it a secret. Mao became more wary of his staff following this episode. His faith in our loyalty began to decline. He came to trust women far more than men, dismissing his male attendants and surrounding himself with women. His young women came to serve as his personal attendants and trusted confidantes.</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Mao's increasing wariness of me dates to this episode, too. When he asked, “Any news?” as he did every time we met, he wanted me to tell him everything I knew. Failure to disclose everything could be taken as evidence of a plot. His suspiciousness began to take deeper hold, and Mao never fully trusted me again.<a name="pic" id="pic"></a></p><p></p></div>
