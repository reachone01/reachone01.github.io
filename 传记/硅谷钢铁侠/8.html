<div class='layout'><p>8 PAIN, SUFFERING, AND SURVIVAL</p><p>8 痛苦、磨难与新生：现实版钢铁侠的商业版图</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“经历过那种压力的人大多数都退缩了，”格雷西亚斯说，“他们会出现决策失误。但是马斯克却变得更加理性，依旧能够做出清晰并且有远见的决定。压力越大，他做得就越好。任何见识了他所经历的一切的人都对他怀有敬意。我从未见过比他更坚毅的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>AS HE PREPARED TO BEGIN FILMING IRON MAN IN EARLY 2007, the director Jon Favreau rented out a complex in Los Angeles that once belonged to Hughes Aircraft, the aerospace and defense contractor started about eighty years earlier by Howard Hughes. The facility had a series of interlocking hangars and served as a production office for the movie. It also supplied Robert Downey Jr., who was to play Iron Man and his human creator Tony Stark, with a splash of inspiration. Downey felt nostalgic looking at one of the larger hangars, which had fallen into a state of disrepair. Not too long ago, that building had played host to the big ideas of a big man who shook up industries and did things his own way.</p><p>2007年年初，当导演乔·费弗洛<sup>(JonFavreau)</sup>准备开始拍摄电影《钢铁侠》时，他租用了休斯飞机公司<sup>(Hughes Aircraft)</sup>位于洛杉矶的一片建筑群。休斯飞机公司于80年前由霍华德·休斯建立，曾是美国主要的防务与航天供应商。这片建筑群由一排排连接在一起的飞机棚组成，用作这部电影的制片室。它给饰演《钢铁侠》剧中主人公托尼·史塔克<sup>(Tony Stark)</sup>的演员罗伯特·唐尼<sup>(Robert Downey)</sup>带来了许多灵感。看着其中一个较大的飞机棚，那年久失修的样子令唐尼不免有些伤感。而就在不久之前，这些建筑则承载了一个伟大人物的宏伟创想。这个人特立独行，令业界震撼。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Downey heard some rumblings about a Hughes-like figure named Elon Musk who had constructed his own, modern-day industrial complex about ten miles away. Instead of visualizing how life might have been for Hughes, Downey could perhaps get a taste of the real thing. He set off in March 2007 for SpaceX's headquarters in El Segundo and wound up receiving a personal tour from Musk. “My mind is not easily blown, but this place and this guy were amazing,” Downey said.</p><p>唐尼听说有一位名叫埃隆·马斯克的人，能够比肩休斯，并在10公里外建立了属于自己的现代工业王国。与其凭空想象休斯的创业人生，唐尼觉得不如切身体会一下马斯克的人生。于是，2007年3月，他来到SpaceX位于埃尔塞贡多的总部，并最终在马斯克本人的陪同下参观了那里。“我不是一个会被轻易撼动的人，但是这家伙和这地方让我大开眼界。”唐尼这样感叹道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To Downey, the SpaceX facility looked like a giant, exotic hardware store. Enthusiastic employees were zipping about, fiddling with an assortment of machines. Young white-collar engineers interacted with blue-collar assembly line workers, and they all seemed to share a genuine excitement for what they were doing. </p><p>在唐尼看来，SpaceX就像是一个巨大而新奇的五金店。热情洋溢的员工们在工厂里不停地穿梭着，忙着摆弄各种机器。年轻的白领工程师和流水线上的蓝领工人们合作紧密，他们看起来发自内心地对这份工作充满了激情。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“It felt like a radical start-up company,” Downey said. After the initial tour, Downey came away pleased that the sets being hammered out at the Hughes factory did have parallels to the SpaceX factory. “Things didn't feel out of place,” he said.</p><p>“你能感受到，这是一家不同凡响的创业公司。”唐尼说。唐尼在第一次参观结束后高兴地离去，向导演提议影片中休斯工厂的布景可以参照SpaceX工厂。在唐尼看来，“那里的一切不会让人感觉格格不入。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Beyond the surroundings, Downey really wanted a peek inside Musk's psyche. The men walked, sat in Musk's office, and had lunch. Downey appreciated that Musk was not a foul-smelling, fidgety, coder whack job. What Downey picked up on instead were Musk's “accessible eccentricities” and the feeling that he was an unpretentious sort who could work alongside the people in the factory. Both Musk and Stark were the type of men, according to Downey, who “had seized an idea to live by and something to dedicate themselves to” and were not going to waste a moment.</p><p>除了参观工厂寻找灵感，唐尼更希望能够窥探马斯克的内心世界，于是他们一起巡视工厂，到马斯克的办公室坐一会儿，并且共进午餐。唐尼非常欣赏马斯克，因为他不是一个臭气冲天、焦躁不安的编程狂人。与此相反，唐尼觉得马斯克的“怪癖”是可以理解的——他并不是那种自命不凡的人，并且可以和员工一起并肩作战。在唐尼看来，影片中的主人公史塔克和马斯克是同一类人，他们“一旦抓住一闪而过的创意，就为自己的想法倾其所有”。他们一秒都不会浪费。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When he returned to the Iron Man production office, Downey asked that Favreau be sure to place a Tesla Roadster in Tony Stark's workshop. On a superficial level, this would symbolize that Stark was so cool and connected that he could get a Roadster before it even went on sale. On a deeper level, the car was to be placed as the nearest object to Stark's desk so that it formed something of a bond between the actor, the character, and Musk. “After meeting Elon and making him real to me, I felt like having his presence in the workshop,” Downey said. “They became contemporaries. Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans.”</p><p>当唐尼返回《钢铁侠》的拍摄地时，他特别要求费弗洛在史塔克的工作室里放一辆特斯拉Roadster。从表面上看，这辆车意味着史塔克走在潮流尖端并且人脉广阔——因为他能够在开售前就得到一辆Roadster。更重要的是，这辆车子被摆放在距离史塔克桌子最近的位置，象征着电影演员、电影角色和马斯克之间的密切联系。“在与埃隆深入接触后，我希望史塔克的工作室里能有一丝他的影子，”唐尼说，“他们属于同一个时代。埃隆会是那种和托尼一起参加派对或者一起去丛林旅行，并且喝下巫师特调饮品的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>After Iron Man came out, Favreau began talking up Musk's role as the inspiration for Downey's interpretation of Tony Stark. It was a stretch on many levels. Musk is not exactly the type of guy who downs scotch in the back of a Humvee while part of a military convoy in Afghanistan. But the press lapped up the comparison, and Musk started to become more of a public figure. People who sort of knew him as “that PayPal guy” began to think of him as the rich, eccentric businessman behind SpaceX and Tesla.</p><p>在《钢铁侠》上映后，导演费弗洛声称马斯克为唐尼诠释托尼·史塔克这个角色提供了许多灵感。这有点夸大其词，因为马斯克并不是那种在阿富汗的军事护送行动中，坐在悍马后面喝苏格兰威士忌的人。然而媒体却对这个说法照单全收，导致马斯克在公众面前的曝光率不断增加。渐渐的，马斯克在人们心目中的形象由“创建PayPal的那个家伙”，逐渐转变为SpaceX和特斯拉背后的一位特立独行的富商。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk enjoyed his rising profile. It fed his ego and provided some fun. He and Justine bought a house in Bel Air. Their neighbor to one side was Quincy Jones, the music producer, and their other neighbor was Joe Francis, the infamous creator of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Musk and some former PayPal executives, having settled their differences, produced Thank You for Smoking and used Musk's jet in the movie. While not a hard-drinking carouser, Musk took part in the Hollywood nightlife and its social scene. “There were just a lot of parties to go to,” said Bill Lee, Musk's close friend. “Elon was neighbors with two quasi-celebrities. Our friends were making movies and through this confluence of our networks, there was something to go out and do every night.” In one interview, Musk calculated that his life had become 10 percent playboy and 90 percent engineer. “We had a domestic staff of five; during the day our home transformed into a workplace,” Justine wrote in magazine article. “We went to black-tie fundraisers and got the best tables at elite Hollywood nightclubs, with Paris Hilton and Leonardo DiCaprio partying next to us. When Google cofounder Larry Page got married on Richard Branson's private Caribbean island, we were there, hanging out in a villa with John Cusack and watching Bono pose with swarms of adoring women outside the reception tent.”</p><p>马斯克十分享受曝光率的增加，在满足了他自尊心的同时又带来了许多乐趣。他和妻子贾斯汀在贝莱尔买下了一栋房子。他们的邻居有音乐制作人昆西·琼斯<sup>(Quincy Jones)</sup>以及视频《狂野女孩》<sup>(Girls Gone Wild)</sup>的制作人，还臭名昭著的成人网站创始人乔·弗兰西斯<sup>(Joe Francis)</sup>。马斯克和几位PayPal的前任高管冰释前嫌，在统一多方意见后，共同制作了电影《感谢你吸烟》<sup>(Thank You For Smoking)</sup>，并且在电影里使用了马斯克的私人飞机。马斯克并不酗酒，但他依然积极穿梭于好莱坞的夜生活以及社交圈。“那里总是有无数派对等着你去参加，”马斯克的好友比尔·李<sup>(Bill Lee)</sup>说，“埃隆和两位不温不火的明星做邻居，他和朋友们还拍了电影。这两个圈子的人混在一起，每天晚上都有找不完的乐子。”在一次采访中，马斯克提到他的生活由10%的花花公子和90%的工程师组成。“我们有5位家务人员。白天的时候，我们家就变成了办公室，”贾斯汀在接受杂志采访时说道，“我们参加高端的慈善晚宴，在好莱坞的高端夜总会里坐在最好的位置——帕丽斯·希尔顿<sup>(Paris Hilton)</sup>和莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥<sup>(Leonardo DiCaprio)</sup>就在隔壁狂欢。当谷歌的创始人拉里·佩奇在理查德·布兰森<sup>(Richard Branson)</sup>的加勒比私人小岛上举行婚礼时，我们也在场，我们在度假酒店和约翰·库萨克<sup>(John Cusack)</sup>共享悠闲时光，在婚礼的帐篷外，看着U2乐队的波诺与成群的美女合影。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Justine appeared to relish their status even more than Musk. A writer of fantasy fiction novels, she kept a blog detailing the couple's family life and their adventures on the town. In one entry, Justine had Musk saying that he'd prefer to sleep with Veronica than Betty from the Archie comics and that he'd like to visit a Chuck E. Cheese sometime. In another entry, she wrote about meeting Leonardo DiCaprio at a club and having him beg for a free Tesla Roadster, only to be turned down. Justine handed out nicknames to oft-occurring characters in the blog, so Bill Lee became “Bill the Hotel Guy” because he owns a hotel in the Dominican Republic, and Joe Francis appeared as “Notorious Neighbor.” It's hard to imagine Musk, who keeps to himself, hanging out with someone as ostentatious as Francis, but the men got along well. When Francis took over an amusement park for his birthday, Musk attended and then ended up partying at Francis's house. Justine wrote, “E was there for a bit but admitted he also found it ‘kind of lame'—he's been to a couple of parties at NN's house now and ends up feeling self-conscious, ‘because it just seems like there are always these skeevy guys wandering around the house trolling for girls. I don't want to be seen as one of those guys.'” When Francis got ready to buy a Roadster, he stopped by the Musks' house and handed over a yellow envelope with $100,000 in cash.</p><p>贾斯汀看上去比马斯克更着迷于他们当下的生活状态。作为一个科幻小说作家，贾斯汀开了一个博客详细记录他们的家庭生活以及他们在城里的各种奇妙经历。她在博客中提到《阿奇漫画》<sup>(Archie Comics)</sup>里的贝蒂和维罗尼卡，说马斯克更想与后者上床，并且他希望有机会可以去一次儿童游乐餐厅“查克奶酪”<sup>(Chuck E. Cheese)</sup>吃饭。而在另一篇文章中，她写道自己在俱乐部里遇见莱昂纳多·迪卡普里奥，并拒绝了他想要一辆免费的特斯拉Roadster的请求。贾斯汀还给博客里常出现的人物取了各种昵称。比尔·李变成了“比尔酒店佬”，因为他在多米尼加共和国有一家酒店；乔·弗朗西斯则变成了“讨厌的邻居”<sup>(NN)</sup>。一般人很难想象马斯克是如何跟弗朗西斯这样臭名远扬的人做朋友的，但他们相处得还不错。马斯克受邀参加了弗朗西斯在游乐场举办的生日派对，之后又跟去弗朗西斯家中继续狂欢。“埃隆虽然在那里待了好一会儿，但他其实觉得有点无聊。他去过好多次NN别墅里的派对，最后却感到十分不自在。埃隆说，‘派对里总是有一群好色之徒，在人群中穿梭猎艳。我可不想被别人当作他们之中的一员。’”当弗朗西斯决定买一辆Roadster时，他直接到马斯克的家里递上一个装着10万美元的黄色信封。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a while, the blog provided a rare, welcome glimpse into the life of an unconventional CEO. Musk seemed charming. The public learned that he bought Justine a nineteenth-century edition of Pride and Prejudice, that Musk's best friends gave him the nickname “Elonius,” and that Musk likes to place one-dollar wagers on all manner of things—Can you catch herpes from the Great Barrier Reef? Is it possible to balance two forks with a toothpick?—that he knows he will win. Justine told one story about Musk traveling to Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, to hang out with Tony Blair and Richard Branson. A photo of the three men appeared later in the press that depicted Musk with a vacant stare. “This was E's I'm-thinking-about-a-rocket-problem stance, which makes me pretty sure that he had just gotten some kind of bothersome work-related e-mail, and was clearly oblivious to the fact that a picture was being taken at all,” she wrote. “This is also the reason I get suck [sic] a kick out of it—the spouse the camera caught is the exact spouse I encountered, say, last night en route to the bathroom, standing in the hallway frowning with his arms folded.” Justine letting the world into the couple's bathroom should have served as a warning of things to come. Her blog would soon turn into one of Musk's worst nightmares.</p><p>贾斯汀的博客一度变得非常受欢迎，因为人们能从中一瞥这位与众不同的CEO私下里的生活。马斯克看起来魅力十足。大家从博客中知道了很多他的生活琐事，比如他为贾斯汀买了一本19世纪出版的《傲慢与偏见》，马斯克的密友们给他起外号叫“天才埃隆”，以及他总喜欢出一美元和别人打赌。例如，你会在大堡礁感染疱疹吗？如何用一根牙签平衡两把叉子？马斯克总是赌这些自己一定能赢的事情。贾斯汀讲述了马斯克和托尼·布莱尔以及理查德·布兰森一起去内克岛旅行的故事。在媒体曝光的三人合影中，马斯克看上去有些心不在焉。“埃隆的表情就像在说：我正在思考一个关于火箭的问题。不过我敢肯定，他刚收到几封令人讨厌的工作邮件，然后完全忘了有人在拍照，”贾斯汀写道，“这就是为什么我这么喜欢这张照片。我的丈夫事实上也如照片中一样，比如昨晚在走廊里看到他时，他同样是双手抱胸，眉头紧皱。”没想到，贾斯汀博客公开的私人生活却成为后面一系列事件的预警，很快成了马斯克的噩梦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The press had not run into a guy like Musk for a very long time. His shine as an Internet millionaire kept getting, well, shinier thanks to PayPal's ongoing success. He also had an element of mystery. There was the weird name. And there was the willingness to spend vast sums of money on spaceships and electric cars, which came across as a combination of daring, flamboyant, and downright flabbergasting. “Elon Musk has been called ‘part playboy, part space cowboy,' an image hardly dispelled by a car collection that has boasted a Porsche 911 Turbo, 1967 Series 1 Jaguar, a Hamann BMW M5 plus the aforementioned McLaren F1—which he has driven at up to 215mph on a private airstrip,” a British reporter gushed in 2007. “Then there was the L39 Soviet military jet, which he sold after becoming a father.” The press had picked up on the fact that Musk tended to talk a huge game and then struggle to deliver on his promises in time, but they didn't much care. The game he talked was so much bigger than anyone else's that reporters were comfortable giving Musk leeway. Tesla became the darling of Silicon Valley's bloggers, who tracked its every move and were breathless in their coverage. Similarly, reporters covering SpaceX were overjoyed that a young, feisty company had arrived to needle Boeing, Lockheed, and, to a large extent, NASA. All Musk had to do was eventually bring some of these wondrous things he'd been funding to market.</p><p>媒体已经很久没有遇到像马斯克一样的家伙了。PayPal公司的成功令这位互联网巨子看起来更加光彩夺目。与此同时，马斯克总是保持着一丝神秘感。他奇怪的名字，以及他不惜重金投资宇宙飞船和电动车的大胆超前行为，让所有人都感到震惊并为之折服。“有人形容埃隆马斯克为‘一半花花公子，一半宇宙牛仔’。他收藏的汽车令这一形象更加深入人心。他有一辆保时捷911<sup>(涡轮增压)</sup>、一辆1967系列捷豹、一辆哈曼宝马M5，还有一辆迈凯轮F1，马斯克曾经开着它在一条私人飞机跑道上飙到时速215英里，”一位英国记者在2007年写道，“此外，他还有一架苏联军用飞机L39，在他为人父之后卖掉了。”媒体发现马斯克总是喜欢提出一些宏伟的设想，尽管他的承诺往往只是空头支票，但媒体依旧十分喜爱马斯克，因为他所谈论的话题远比其他人要宏伟得多。特斯拉成了硅谷博主们的宠儿。博主们时刻关心着特斯拉的动向，任何风吹草动都能让他们激动不已。同样，追踪SpaceX的记者们也无比兴奋，因为这家年轻、充满活力的公司触怒了波音、洛克希德，甚至令美国国家航空航天局蒙羞。马斯克所做的只不过是将他投资的奇思妙想推向市场。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While Musk put on a good show for the public and press, he'd started to get very worried about his businesses. SpaceX's second launch attempt had failed, and the reports coming in from Tesla kept getting worse. Musk had started these two adventures with a fortune nearing $200 million and had chewed through more than half the money with little to show for it. As each Tesla delay turned into a PR fiasco, the Musk glow dimmed. People in Silicon Valley began to gossip about Musk's money problems. Reporters who months earlier had been heaping adulation on Musk turned on him. The New York Times picked up on Tesla's transmission problems. Automotive websites griped that the Roadster might never ship. By the end of 2007, things got downright nasty. Valleywag, Silicon Valley's gossip blog, began to take a particular interest in Musk. Owen Thomas, the site's lead writer, dug into the histories of Zip2 and PayPal and played up the times Musk was ousted as CEO to undermine some of his entrepreneurial street cred. Thomas then championed the premise that Musk was a master manipulator who played fast and loose with other people's money. “It's wonderful that Musk has realized even a small part of his childhood fantasies,” Thomas wrote. “But he risks destroying his dreams by refusing to reconcile them with reality.” Valleywag anointed the Tesla Roadster as its No. 1 fail of 2007 among technology companies.</p><p>马斯克在公众和媒体面前做足了秀，但他却开始为他的事业感到忧心。SpaceX的第二次发射失败了，特斯拉的财务报告也越来越不尽如人意。马斯克在这两个项目开始时拥有近2亿美元的资产，然而，当近一半的资产被用掉后，两个项目都没有取得明显的进展。当特斯拉的延期交货演变成公关危机时，马斯克身上的光环也消失殆尽。硅谷开始谈论马斯克打了水漂的巨额投资，那些几个月前还对马斯克赞不绝口的记者开始处处针对他。《纽约时报》报道了特斯拉变速系统的问题，汽车网站嘲讽特斯拉Roadster永远也出不了厂。到2007年年末，事态变得更加糟糕。硅谷著名的八卦博客“硅谷八卦”开始爆料马斯克的过去。网站的首席作者欧文·托马斯<sup>(Owen Thomas)</sup>挖掘出了Zip2和PayPal公司的历史，爆料马斯克作为CEO曾经被公司驱逐，令马斯克作为创业家的信誉度大大降低。欧文将马斯克形容成一个滥用他人资产的职业操盘手，他写道，“马斯克能够实现部分童年幻想是一件值得高兴的事，但事实是，他正在亲手毁掉他的梦想，因为他不愿意向现实中的制约条件妥协。”与此同时，“硅谷八卦”将特斯拉Roadster评为2007年科技公司最失败的项目。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As his businesses and public persona suffered, Musk's home life degraded as well. His triplets—Kai, Damian, and Saxon—had arrived near the end of 2006 and joined their brothers Griffin and Xavier. According to Musk, Justine suffered from postpartum depression following the birth of the triplets. “In the spring of 2007, our marriage was having real issues,” Musk said. “It was on the rocks.” Justine's blog posts back up his sentiments. She described a much less romantic Musk and felt people treated her as “an arm ornament who couldn't possibly have anything interesting to say” rather than as an author and her husband's equal. During one trip to St. Barts, the Musks ended up sharing dinner with some wealthy, influential couples. When Justine let out her political views, one of the men at the table made a crack about her being so opinionated. “E chuckled back, patted my hand the way you pat a child's,” Justine wrote on her blog. From that point on, Justine ordered Musk to introduce her as a published novelist and not just his wife and mother of his children. The results? “E's way of doing this throughout the rest of the trip: ‘Justine wants me to tell you that she's written novels,' which made people look at me like oh, that's just so cute and didn't really help my case.”</p><p>当马斯克的公司出现问题，个人名誉受损后，他的家庭生活也开始出现危机。在格里芬和泽维尔出生之后，马斯克在2006年年底又迎来了三胞胎——凯、达米安和萨克逊。马斯克说，贾斯汀在生完三胞胎后患上了严重的产后抑郁症。“2007年春天，我们的婚姻开始出现裂痕，我们的关系变得岌岌可危。”马斯克这样回忆道。贾斯汀的博客证实了马斯克的说法。在贾斯汀的博客中，马斯克变得不再浪漫迷人，她总是觉得没有人把自己当成一位作家或者是和丈夫地位相同的人，大家都认为她只是一只没有什么内涵的花瓶。在一次去圣巴茨<sup>(St. Barts)</sup>旅行的途中，马斯克夫妇和许多声名显赫的夫妇共进晚餐。贾斯汀在餐桌上表达了自己的政治观点，但是却遭到了一位在场男士的嘲讽，因为他觉得贾斯汀太固执己见。“埃隆也笑了笑，然后就像在抚慰孩子一般拍了拍我的手。”贾斯汀在博客上记录下马斯克的反应。从那之后，贾斯汀要求马斯克向众人介绍自己是一位出版过小说的作家，而不只是他的妻子或是他孩子们的母亲。结果呢？“埃隆在之后的旅途中不停地向别人说：‘贾斯汀想让我告诉你她写过几本小说。’这只让人冲我敷衍地笑一笑，而没有给我的处境带来任何改变。”贾斯汀在博客中写道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As 2007 rolled into 2008, Musk's life became more tumultuous. Tesla basically had to start over on much of the Roadster, and SpaceX still had dozens of people living in Kwajalein awaiting the next launch of the Falcon 1. Both endeavors were vacuuming up Musk's money. He started selling off prized possessions like the McLaren to generate extra cash. Musk tended to shield employees from the gravity of his fiscal situation by always encouraging them to do their best work. At the same time, he personally oversaw all significant purchases at both companies. Musk also trained employees to make the right trade-offs between spending money and productivity. This struck many of the SpaceX employees as a novel idea, since they were used to traditional aerospace companies that had huge, multiyear government contracts and no day-to-day survival pressure. “Elon would always be at work on Sunday, and we had some chats where he laid out his philosophy,” said Kevin Brogan, the early SpaceX employee. “He would say that everything we did was a function of our burn rate and that we were burning through a hundred thousand dollars per day. It was this very entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley way of thinking that none of the aerospace engineers in Los Angeles were dialed into. Sometimes he wouldn't let you buy a part for two thousand dollars because he expected you to find it cheaper or invent something cheaper. Other times, he wouldn't flinch at renting a plane for ninety thousand dollars to get something to Kwaj because it saved an entire workday, so it was worth it. He would place this urgency that he expected the revenue in ten years to be ten million dollars a day and that every day we were slower to achieve our goals was a day of missing out on that money.”</p><p>当时间从2007年迈向2008年时，马斯克的生活变得更加动荡不安。特斯拉基本上必须从头开始Roadster项目，而SpaceX还有许多人住在夸贾林环礁等待着“猎鹰1号”的下一次发射。马斯克的资金被这些项目迅速榨干，导致他不得不变卖自己的迈凯轮跑车和其他私人财产来换取更多的资金。马斯克会尽量避免员工受到当前财政状况的影响，亲自监管公司里每一笔大型支出，并且鼓励员工们好好工作。同时，马斯克也开始训练雇员们在金钱和效率之间做出正确的选择。对于许多SpaceX的员工来说，在金钱和效率之间进行权衡是一个新鲜的命题，因为传统的航天公司总是能从政府得到大笔资助，不会有这样的生存压力。SpaceX的早期雇员凯文·布罗根说，“埃隆周日也总是在工作，我们交谈的时候他就会讲讲自己的哲学理念。在他看来，我们每天所做的事情决定了消耗资金的速度，而我们每天会花费10万美元。这种硅谷式的创新想法十分超前，洛杉矶的航天工程师并不会完全适应。有时候，马斯克会拒绝购买一个2 000美元的配件，因为他期待你能够找到更便宜的配件或者自己发明出更省钱的方法。但他又可以不惜花费花9万美元租用一架飞机将东西送往夸贾林环礁，因为这样做可以节省一整天的工作时间。马斯克预期10年后，公司的日营收可以达到1 000万美元，所以时间是当前最紧要的问题。我们的进度每拖延一天，就相当于损失1 000万美元。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk had become all consumed with Tesla and SpaceX out of necessity, and there can be no doubt that this exacerbated the tensions in his marriage. The Musks had a team of nannies to help with their five children, but Elon could not spend much time at home. He worked seven days a week and quite often split his time between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Justine needed a change. During moments of self-reflection, she felt sickened, perceiving herself a trophy wife. Justine longed to be Elon's partner again and to feel some of that spark from their early days before life had turned so dazzling and demanding. It's not clear how much Musk let on to Justine about his dwindling bank account. She has long maintained that Musk kept her in the dark about the family's financial arrangements. But some of Musk's closest friends did get a glimpse into the worsening financial situation. In the first half of 2008, Antonio Gracias, the founder and CEO of Valor Equity, met Musk for dinner. Gracias had been an investor in Tesla and had become one of Musk's closest friends and allies, and he could see Musk agonizing over his future. “Things were starting to be difficult with Justine, but they were still together,” Gracias said. “During that dinner, Elon said, ‘I will spend my last dollar on these companies. If we have to move into Justine's parents' basement, we'll do it.'”</p><p>因为事态紧急，马斯克把全部的精力都放在了特斯拉和SpaceX上，这无疑让他的婚姻问题加速恶化。马斯克夫妇有一个保姆团队负责照顾孩子们，但是埃隆并不常常在家。他一周工作七天，并且常常往返于洛杉矶和旧金山两地。贾斯汀急切地想要改变现状，因为他们的生活变得令人眩晕并且吃力。在无数次自我反省后，贾斯汀厌恶了自己作为花瓶的形象，她渴望能够重新成为埃隆的同伴，找回他们之间最初的激情。没有人清楚马斯克向贾斯汀坦白了多少，贾斯汀声称她一直被蒙在鼓里，马斯克从不向她透露任何关于家庭财政状况的信息。但马斯克的一些朋友却无意中了解到他的财政状况每况愈下。2008年上半年，私募基金ValorEquity的创始人兼CEO安东尼奥·格雷西亚斯<sup>(Antonio Gracias)</sup>曾和马斯克一起共进晚餐。格雷西亚斯是特斯拉的投资人之一，与马斯克是关系很好的朋友和合作伙伴，他感到马斯克对未来十分悲观。据格雷西亚斯说，“贾斯汀的生活变得有点艰难，但是他们当时还在一起。在那次晚餐上，埃隆说，‘我会把最后一分钱都花在公司上，即使我们得搬进贾斯汀父母的地下室。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The option of moving in with Justine's parents expired on June 16, 2008, when Musk filed for divorce. The couple did not disclose the situation right away, although Justine left hints on her blog. In late June, she posted a quotation from Moby without any additional context: “There's no such thing as a well-adjusted public figure. If they were well adjusted they wouldn't try to be a public figure.” The next entry had Justine house hunting for undisclosed reasons with Sharon Stone, and a couple of entries later she talked about “a major drama” that she'd been dealing with. In September, Justine wrote her first blog post explicitly about the divorce, saying, “We had a good run. We married young, took it as far as we could and now it is over.” Valleywag naturally followed with a story about the divorce and noted that Musk had been seen out with a twenty-something actress.</p><p>但在2008年6月16日，搬进地下室的想法也破灭了，因为马斯克在这天办理了离婚手续。马斯克夫妇没有立即公开离婚的消息，但从贾斯汀更新的博客中还是能看出些蛛丝马迹。6月底，贾斯汀突兀地在博客上引用了音乐人莫比<sup>(Moby)</sup>的一句话，“世界上从来没有完美的、在任何场所都收放自如的公众人物。如果他们是完美的，那么他们就不会想成为公众人物。”接下来的一篇博客则是关于她开始和莎朗·斯通<sup>(Sharon Stone)</sup>一起找房子。在接下来的几篇博客中，她提到自己最近正在处理“一场大纷争”。9月，贾斯汀终于正式发表了第一篇关于离婚的博文，她写道，“我们曾有过一段美好时光。我们在年轻的时候就结为伴侣，相依走过了漫漫长路，而现在我们走到了尽头。”“硅谷八卦”自然一路跟踪着他们的离婚故事，并且声称马斯克在与一个20多岁的女演员约会。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The media coverage and divorce freed Justine to write about her private life in a much more liberated way. In the posts that followed, she gave her account of how the marriage ended, her views on Musk's girlfriend and future second wife, and the inner workings of the divorce proceedings. For the first time, the public had access to a deeply unpleasant portrayal of Musk and received some firsthand accounts—albeit from an ex-wife—of his hardline behavior. The writing may have been biased, but it provided a window into how Musk operated. Here's one post about the lead-up to the divorce and its rapid execution:</p><p>离婚以及媒体的报道让贾斯汀能够更加自由地在博客上书写自己的生活感想。在接下来的博客中，她详细描述了他们的婚姻是如何结束的、她对马斯克的女友及未来妻子的看法，以及他们的离婚细节。公众第一次接触到马斯克令人生厌的一面，人们得以通过第一手资料了解他私下里的强硬作风——尽管是通过他的前妻。贾斯汀的文字也许有些偏激，但是它让人们从另一个角度了解了马斯克的所作所为。这里是一段她对离婚过程的描述：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Divorce, for me, was like the bomb you set off when all other options have been exhausted. I had not yet given up on the diplomacy option, which was why I hadn't already filed. We were still in the early stages of marital counseling (three sessions total). Elon, however, took matters into his own hands—he tends to like to do that—when he gave me an ultimatum: “Either we fix [the marriage] today, or I will divorce you tomorrow.”</p><p>对我来说，离婚这个选项是当你无路可走时才引爆的炸弹。我还没有放弃“交涉”这个选项，所以我并没有签署离婚协议。我们当时才刚刚处在婚姻咨询阶段<sup>(总共三个阶段)</sup>，但是埃隆想按照他的方式解决问题，就像他一贯的作风，于是他给我下了最后通牒：“如果我们今天不能解决<sup>(婚姻问题)</sup>，那么我们明天就离婚。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>That night, and again the next morning, he asked me what I wanted to do. I stated emphatically that I was not ready to unleash the dogs of divorce; I suggested that “we” hold off for at least another week. Elon nodded, touched the top of my head, and left. Later that same morning I tried to make a purchase and discovered that he had cut off my credit card, which is when I also knew that he had gone ahead and filed (as it was, E did not tell me directly; he had another person do it).</p><p>那天晚上以及第二天早上，他又问我到底想做什么。我反复向他强调，我还没有准备好离婚，我希望我们能再试着相处一周。埃隆点头同意，拍了拍我的头，转身离开。结果当天早上，我在购物时发现埃隆停掉了我的信用卡，紧接着我发现他已经先行一步签署了离婚协议。<sup>(他没有亲自告诉我，而是让别人告诉我这一事实。)</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Musk, each online missive from Justine created another public relations crisis that added to the endless stream of issues faced by his companies. The image he'd sculpted over the years appeared ready to crumble alongside his businesses. It was a disaster scenario.</p><p>对马斯克来说，贾斯汀的每一篇博客都将引发更多的公关危机，这无疑令他面临困境的公司雪上加霜。他多年来苦心经营的形象和事业一起轰然倒塌，一切都变成灾难。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Soon enough, the Musks had achieved celebrity divorce status. Mainstream outlets joined Valleywag in poring over court filings tied to the breakup, particularly as Justine fought for more money. During the PayPal days, Justine had signed a postnuptial agreement and now argued that she didn't really have the time or inclination to dig into the ramifications of the paperwork. Justine took to her blog in an entry titled “golddigger,” and said she was fighting for a divorce settlement that would include their house, alimony and child support, $6 million in cash, 10 percent of Musk's Tesla stock, 5 percent of Musk's SpaceX stock, and a Tesla Roadster. Justine also appeared on CNBC's show Divorce Wars and wrote an article for Marie Claire titled “‘I Was a Starter Wife': Inside America's Messiest Divorce.”</p><p>不久，马斯克夫妇的离婚案变得更加引人注目。主流媒体和“硅谷八卦”一样，开始跟踪报道他们离婚后的法院判决，尤其是贾斯汀开始争取更多赡养费一事。在马斯克经营PayPal期间，贾斯汀曾经签署过一份婚后协议，但是她现在声称自己当时并没有足够的时间和兴趣好好研究这份协议中的条款。贾斯汀发表了一篇名为“掘金者”的博文，并且扬言她正在争取离婚后得到他们的房子、赡养费、儿童教育费、600万美元现金、马斯克持有的特斯拉股份中的10%、SpaceX股份中的5%以及一辆特斯拉Roadster。贾斯汀甚至还上了CNBC<sup>(美国广播公司财经频道)</sup>的节目《离婚的战争》，并且为女性杂志《嘉人》<sup>(Marie Claire)</sup>撰写了一篇文章，题为“我曾是一个创业者的妻子：美国最混乱的离婚内情”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The public tended to side with Justine during all of this and couldn't quite figure out why a billionaire was fighting his wife's seemingly fair requests. A major problem for Musk, of course, was that his assets were anything but liquid with most of his net worth being tied up in Tesla and SpaceX stock. The couple eventually settled with Justine getting the house, $2 million in cash (minus her legal fees), $80,000 a month in alimony and child support for seventeen years, and a Tesla Roadster.*</p><p>在离婚案中，公众更倾向于站在贾斯汀这边，因为他们不能理解为什么一个亿万富翁要拒绝妻子看似合理的请求。马斯克的问题在于他的大部分资产都投进了特斯拉和SpaceX的股票，而这些资产很难套现。这对夫妇最终达成和解，贾斯汀得到房产、两百万美元现金<sup>(不包括律师费用)</sup>、每个月8万美元赡养费、17年的儿童抚养费以及一辆特斯拉Roadster。<sup>[1]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Years after the settlement, Justine still struggled to speak about her relationship with Musk. During our interview, she broke down in tears several times and needed moments to compose her thoughts. Musk, she said, had hidden many things from her during their marriage and ultimately treated her much like a business adversary to be conquered during the divorce. “We were at war for a while, and when you go to war with Elon, it's pretty brutal,” she said. Well after their marriage ended, Justine continued to blog about Musk. She wrote about Riley and provided commentary on his parenting. One post gave Musk a hard time for banning stuffed animals from the house when their twins turned seven. Asked about this, Justine said, “Elon is hard-core. He grew up in a tough culture and tough circumstances. He had to become very tough to not only thrive but to conquer the world. He doesn't want to raise soft overprivileged kids with no direction.” Comments like these seemed to indicate that Justine still admired or at least understood Musk's strong will.*</p><p>在离婚案尘埃落定后的几年里，贾斯汀依旧无法正常谈论她和马斯克之间的关系。在我们的采访中，她数次落泪并且需要时间平复心情。她说，在他们的婚姻关系中，马斯克对她隐瞒了很多事情，而最后离婚时，马斯克却把她当作商业对手来征服。“有段时间我们的关系就像敌人，但如果你的对手是埃隆，那么战争会变得非常残酷。”贾斯汀回忆道。在他们的婚姻结束后，贾斯汀还是经常发表关于马斯克的博文。她写到了莱丽并且对马斯克的教育方式做出了评价。一篇让马斯克难堪的博文写道，双胞胎7岁时，马斯克禁止在家里摆放任何毛绒玩具。提起这件事，贾斯汀说，“埃隆非常强硬。他在严厉的家庭和社会环境中长大，所以他变得十分强悍，这样才能够变得强大并且征服世界。他不希望过分溺爱孩子，不希望他们没有人生目标。”贾斯汀的评论似乎说明了她仍旧欣赏，或是理解马斯克的强势。<sup>[2]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the weeks after he first filed for divorce in mid-June of 2008, Musk tumbled into a deep funk. Bill Lee started to worry about his friend's mental state and, as one of Musk's more free-spirited friends, wanted to do something to cheer him up. Now and again, Musk and Lee, an investor, would take trips overseas and mix business and pleasure. The time was right for just such a journey, and they set off for London at the start of July.</p><p>2008年6月中旬，在签署离婚协议后的几周里，马斯克陷入了深深的恐惧。比尔·李开始担心马斯克的精神状况，作为马斯克性格最爽朗的朋友，李希望自己能做些什么来振奋一下马斯克的心情。于是马斯克和投资人李决定来一次工作和娱乐两不忘的海外旅行。时间正好适合进行一次旅行，于是他们在7月初一同飞往伦敦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The decompression program began poorly. Musk and Lee visited the headquarters of Aston Martin to see the company's CEO and get a tour of his factory. The executive treated Musk like an amateur car builder, talking down to him and suggesting that he knew more about electric vehicles than anyone else on the planet. “He was a complete douche,” as Lee put it, and the men did their best to make a hasty exit back to central London. Along the way, Musk had a nagging stomach pain turn severe. At the time, Lee was married to Sarah Gore, the daughter of former vice president Al Gore, who had been a medical student, and so he called her for advice. They decided that Musk might be suffering from appendicitis, and Lee took him to a medical clinic in the middle of a shopping mall. When the tests came back negative, Lee set to work trying to goad Musk into a night on the town. “Elon didn't want to go out, and I didn't really, either,” Lee said. “But I was like, ‘No, come on. We're all the way here.'”</p><p>缓解压力的旅行一开始进展得并不顺利。马斯克和李一起拜访了阿斯顿·马丁汽车公司，在该公司CEO的陪同下，他们在公司里参观了一圈。这位CEO认为马斯克只是汽车制造的业余爱好者，和他们说话时语气高人一等，好像自己才是世界上最懂电动汽车的人。“他给我们浇了一大桶冷水。”李这样形容当时的场景，于是两人匆匆返回伦敦。在回程的路上，马斯克的胃疼更加厉害了。当时李的妻子莎拉·戈尔，前副总统艾伯特·戈尔的女儿，曾经是医学院的学生，于是李打电话给莎拉寻求帮助。他们觉得马斯克可能得了阑尾炎，于是李将马斯克带去一家诊所。检查结果证明没事，于是李希望能够在晚上带马斯克出去玩。“埃隆不想出门，我也不想，”李解释道，“但是我对马斯克说，‘别这样嘛，一起出来玩。我们已经来到伦敦了。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Lee coaxed Musk into going to a club called Whisky Mist, in Mayfair. People had packed the small, high-end dance spot and Musk wanted to leave after ten minutes. The well-connected Lee texted a promoter friend of his, who pulled some strings to get Musk escorted into the VIP area. The promoter then reached out to some of his prettiest friends, including a twenty-two-year-old up-and-coming actress named Talulah Riley, and they soon arrived at the club as well. Riley and her two gorgeous friends had come from a charity gala and were in full-length, flowing gowns. “Talulah was in this huge Cinderella thing,” Lee said. Musk and Riley were introduced by people at the club, and he perked at the sight of her dazzling figure.</p><p>李将马斯克哄骗进Mayfair<sup>(伦敦上流住宅区)</sup>一家名为“威士忌雾”的俱乐部。人们挤在里面疯狂地跳舞，马斯克进去不到10分钟就想离开。人脉甚广的李立即发短信给自己的一个朋友，那人将马斯克领进了贵宾区。李的朋友马上叫来了他的一些漂亮朋友，包括22岁的新人演员妲露拉·莱莉。莱莉和她的两位漂亮朋友刚从一个慈善晚宴回来，她们身上都还穿着修长飘逸的礼服。“妲露拉当时穿着和灰姑娘一样的公主裙。”李这样形容他们的相遇。俱乐部里的人介绍马斯克和莱莉认识，在莱莉光彩夺目的美貌面前，马斯克的精神振作了起来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk and Riley sat at a table with their friends but immediately zeroed in on each other. Riley had just hit it big with her portrayal of Mary Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and thought of herself as quite the hotshot. The older Musk, meanwhile, took on the role of the soft-spoken, sweet engineer. He whipped out his phone and displayed photos of the Falcon 1 and Roadster, although Riley thought he had just done some work on these projects and didn't realize he ran the companies building the machines. “I remember thinking that this guy probably didn't get to talk to young actresses a lot and that he seemed quite nervous,” Riley said. “I decided to be really nice to him and give him a nice evening. Little did I know that he'd spoken to a lot of pretty girls in his life.”* The more Musk and Riley talked, the more Lee egged them on. It was the first time in weeks that his friend appeared happy. “His stomach didn't hurt; he's not bummed, this is great,” Lee said. Despite being dressed for a fairy tale, Riley didn't fall in love with Musk at first sight. But she did become more impressed and intrigued as the night went on, particularly after the club promoter introduced Musk to a stunning model, and he politely said “Hello” and then sat right back down with Riley. “I figured he couldn't be all bad after that,” said Riley, who then allowed Musk to place his hand on her knee. Musk asked Riley out to dinner the next night, and she accepted.</p><p>刚开始，马斯克和莱莉跟朋友们坐在一起，但不一会儿，他们的眼中就只剩下对方。莱莉刚刚在电影《傲慢与偏见》里出演了玛丽·班内特，自我感觉良好。在她面前，年长的马斯克成了说话慢声细语的工程师。马斯克拿出手机给莱莉展示了“猎鹰1号”和特斯拉Roadster的照片，但莱莉以为马斯克只是参与了这些项目，她完全没有想到马斯克是运作这两家公司的老板。“当时我想，这家伙应该没怎么和女演员讲过话，因为他看起来很紧张，”莱莉回忆道，“于是我决定对他好一点，让他度过一个难忘的夜晚。当时我完全不知道他见过无数漂亮姑娘。”<sup>[3]</sup>马斯克和莱莉交谈得越多，李在旁边越是不断地撮合，因为这是几周以来他的朋友第一次露出开心的表情。“马斯克的胃不疼了，他也不再垂头丧气，这真是令人高兴。”李回忆道。尽管莱莉穿得像童话故事里的公主，但是她并没有对马斯克一见钟情。不过，当夜晚继续，莱莉发现马斯克越来越有意思，尤其是当俱乐部经理给马斯克介绍了一个漂亮模特时，他只是礼貌地说了声“你好”便坐回了莱莉身边。“我当时想，至少他不是一个坏家伙。”莱莉这样说道。于是，当马斯克的手放在她的膝盖上时，她什么也没说，并且欣然接受了马斯克邀请她第二天共进晚餐的请求。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With her curvy figure, sultry eyes, and playful good-girl demeanor, Riley was a budding film star but didn't really act the part. She grew up in the idyllic English countryside, went to a top school, and, until a week before she met Musk, had been living at home with her parents. After the night at Whisky Mist, Riley called her family to tell them about the interesting guy she had met who builds rockets and cars. Her father used to head up the National Crime Squad and went straight to his computer to conduct a background check that illuminated Musk's resume as a married international playboy with five kids. Riley's father chided his daughter for being a fool, but she held out hope that Musk had an explanation and went to dinner with him anyway.</p><p>莱莉有着曼妙的身材、热情的双眼和得体的行为举止，尽管是正当红的电影新星，但她并没有表现出丝毫傲慢。莱莉在诗画般的英国乡村长大，毕业于顶尖院校，直到她和马斯克见面的前一周，她还和父母住在一块儿。在俱乐部度过愉快的一晚后，莱莉打电话告诉家人她遇见了一个制造火箭和汽车的有意思的家伙。莱莉的父亲曾经在英国国家犯罪小组<sup>(National Crime Squad)</sup>工作，他听后立刻打开电脑查询了马斯克的身份，发现马斯克已婚，有5个孩子，并且是个出了名的花花公子。莱莉的父亲怒斥女儿被蒙骗了，但是莱莉却觉得这其中有些误会，她相信马斯克能够解释这一切，于是她第二天还是按时奔赴了晚餐。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk brought Lee to the dinner, and Riley brought her friend Tamsin Egerton, also a beautiful actress. Things were cooler throughout the meal as the group dined in a depressingly empty restaurant. Riley waited to see what Musk would bring up on his own. Eventually, he did announce his five sons and his pending divorce. The confession proved enough to keep Riley interested and curious about where things would lead. Following the meal, Musk and Riley broke off on their own. They went for a walk through Soho and then stopped at Cafe Boheme, where Riley, a lifelong teetotaler, sipped an apple juice. Musk kept Riley's attention, and the romance began in earnest.</p><p>马斯克带上了李一起共进晚餐，而莱莉则带上了同样是演员的漂亮朋友塔姆欣·伊格顿<sup>(Tamsin Egerton)</sup>。晚餐的氛围有些压抑，因为餐厅里除了他们几乎没有其他人。莱莉暗自期待马斯克能主动解释一下他的婚姻问题，果然，马斯克提起了他的5个儿子以及还在司法程序中的离婚诉讼。马斯克的坦白对莱莉来说已经足够证明他的真心并且让她继续观望下去。晚饭后，马斯克和莱莉一起离开。他们散步到市中心区，滴酒不沾的莱莉还在波西米亚咖啡馆买了杯苹果汁。马斯克的成功引起了莱莉的兴趣，他们的爱情始于对彼此的坦诚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The couple had lunch the next day and then went to the White Cube, a modern art gallery, and then back to Musk's hotel room. Musk told Riley, a virgin, that he wanted to show her his rockets. “I was skeptical, but he did actually show me rocket videos,” she said. Once Musk went back to the United States,* they kept in touch via e-mail for a couple of weeks, and then Riley booked a flight to Los Angeles. “I wasn't even thinking girlfriend or anything like that,” Riley said. “I was just having fun.”</p><p>马斯克和莱莉在第二天共进午餐后一同参观了现代艺术馆白立方画廊<sup>(White Cube)</sup>，随后他们一起返回马斯克的酒店。莱莉还是处女，而马斯克告诉她他想给她看看自己的火箭。“我心存疑虑，但是他真的就只是给我看了几段火箭的视频。”莱莉回忆道。在马斯克返回美国后的几周里<sup>[4]</sup>，他们一直互相发邮件保持联系，不久，莱莉便买了前往洛杉矶的机票。“我当时完全没有想过要当他的女朋友，”莱莉解释道，“只是觉得和他相处很有趣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk had other ideas. Riley had been in California for just five days when he made his move as they lay in bed talking in a tiny room at the Peninsula hotel in Beverley Hills. “He said, ‘I don't want you to leave. I want you to marry me.' I think I laughed. Then, he said, ‘No. I'm serious. I'm sorry I don't have a ring.' I said, ‘We can shake on it if you like.' And we did. I don't remember what I was thinking at the time, and all I can say is that I was twenty-two.”</p><p>马斯克却不这样想。莱莉只在加州待5天，当他们一起躺在贝弗利山庄半岛酒店的床上聊天时，马斯克决心让他们的关系更进一步。“他说，‘我不希望你离开。我希望你嫁给我。’我记得我当时笑出了声。然后他继续说道，‘我是认真的，只是很抱歉我现在没有戒指。’于是我说，‘如果你愿意，那我们可以用口头约定代替。’于是我们约定了。我并不记得自己当时是怎么想的，我只能说那时候我才22岁。”莱莉回忆起当时的场景时这样说道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Riley had been a model daughter up to that point, never giving her parents much of anything to worry about. She did well at school, had scored some tremendous acting gigs, and had a soft, sweet personality that her friends described as Snow White brought to life. But there she was on the hotel's balcony, informing her parents that she had agreed to marry a man fourteen years her senior, who had just filed for divorce from his first wife, had five kids and two companies, and she didn't even see how she could possibly love him after knowing him for a matter of weeks. “I think my mother had a nervous breakdown,” Riley said. “But I had always been highly romantic, and it actually didn't strike me as that strange.” Riley flew back to England to gather her things, and her parents flew back with her to the United States to meet Musk, who belatedly asked Riley's father for his blessing. Musk did not have his own house, which left the couple moving into a home that belonged to Musk's friend the billionaire Jeff Skoll. “I had been living there a week when this random guy walked in,” Riley said. “I said, ‘Who are you?' He said, ‘I am the homeowner. Who are you?' I told him, and then he just walked out.” Musk later proposed to Riley again on the balcony of Skoll's house, unveiling a massive ring. (He has since bought her three engagement rings, including the giant first one, an everyday ring, and one designed by Musk that has a diamond surrounded by ten sapphires.) “I remember him saying, ‘Being with me was choosing the hard path.' I didn't quite understand at the time, but I do now. It's quite hard, quite the crazy ride.”</p><p>莱莉从小到大都是模范女儿，从来不需要父母为她操心。她在学校里表现出色，在表演方面也取得了非同凡响的成绩，加上她性格温柔可爱，朋友们都形容她是现实里的白雪公主。然而，此刻她站在酒店的阳台上，打电话通知父母，她要和一个比她大14岁，有5个孩子和两家公司，刚和前妻离婚的男人结婚，并且他们仅仅认识了短短几周，连她自己也不能确定自己是否爱他。“我觉得我妈妈听到消息时都要崩溃了，”莱莉说，“但我自己并不觉得有什么奇怪，因为我一直以来都是浪漫主义者。”紧接着莱莉飞回英国收拾自己的行李，然后和父母一起飞回美国见马斯克，后者这时才后知后觉地请求莱莉父亲的同意。马斯克没有自己的房子，于是他们搬进了马斯克的朋友、亿万富翁杰夫·斯科尔<sup>(Jeff Skoll)</sup>的房子里。“我在房子里住了大概一周，然后某天有个陌生人走进来，”莱莉回忆道，“我问他，‘你是谁？’他反问我，‘我是这个房子的主人，你是谁？’我告诉他我的身份后他就一声不响地走开了。”不久后，马斯克在斯科尔别墅的阳台上用一枚巨大的钻戒向莱莉求婚了。<sup>(马斯克前后共买过三枚订婚戒指给莱莉，包括一枚大钻戒、一枚日常戴的戒指，以及一枚马斯克自己设计的、由10颗蓝宝石环绕着钻石、意味着他们希望拥有10个孩子的戒指。)</sup>“我记得他当时说，‘和我在一起意味着你选择了一条最艰难的路。’我当时并不明白，但现在我却能够理解。这确实艰辛，简直像是在坐过山车。”莱莉这样说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Riley experienced a baptism by fire. The whirlwind romance had given her the impression that she was engaged to a world conquering, jet-setting billionaire. That was true in theory but a murkier proposition in practice. As late July rolled around, Musk could see that he had just enough cash on hand to scrape through to the end of the year. Both SpaceX and Tesla would need cash infusions at some point just to pay the employees, and it was unclear where that money would come from with the world's financial markets in disarray and investments being put on hold. If things had been going more smoothly at the companies, Musk could have felt more confident about raising money, but they were not. “He would come home every day, and there would be some calamity,” Riley said. “He was under immense pressure from all quarters. It was horrendous.”</p><p>莱莉体会到了如火一样的爱情的洗礼。这如飓风般突如其来的爱情让莱莉觉得自己嫁给了一个出手阔绰、征服世界的亿万富翁。理论上来讲，这是对的，但是现实却不容乐观。当7月逐渐步入尾声，马斯克意识到他的现金只够勉强撑到年底。SpaceX和特斯拉都需要资金注入以支付员工们的工资，但当时的世界金融市场一片狼藉，所有的投资都被迫暂停，没有人知道这些钱该从哪里来。如果公司里的项目进展得顺利，马斯克就会对筹集资金更有信心，然而这些项目都不尽如人意。“他每天回家后都会带回一些不好的消息，”莱莉说，“他当时正经历着来自四面八方的压力。那真是可怕的回忆。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>SpaceX's third flight from Kwajalein jumped out as Musk's most pressing concern. His team of engineers had remained camped out on the island, preparing the Falcon 1 for another run. A typical company would focus just on the task at hand. Not SpaceX. It had shipped the Falcon 1 to Kwaj in April with one set of engineers and then put another group of engineers on a new project to develop the Falcon 9, a nine-engine rocket that would take the place of the Falcon 5 and serve as a possible replacement to the retiring space shuttle. SpaceX had yet to prove it could get to space successfully, but Musk kept positioning it to bid on big-ticket NASA contracts.*</p><p>SpaceX在夸贾林环礁的第三次发射成了马斯克最头疼的问题。为了“猎鹰1号”的再次发射，他的工程师们已经在岛上滞留了许久。正常的公司都会着眼于当前最紧迫的任务，但是SpaceX并没有这么做。马斯克在4月的时候将“猎鹰1号”和一队工程师送到了夸贾林环礁，然后让另一队工程师着手开发“猎鹰9号”——一艘有9台发动机的火箭，能够取代“猎鹰5号”以及即将退休的航天飞机。SpaceX并不能保证发射成功，但马斯克为了能够得到NASA的高价合约而不断推销这款火箭。<sup>[5]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On July 30, 2008, the Falcon 9 had a successful test fire in Texas with all nine of its engines lighting up and producing 850,000 pounds of thrust. Three days later, in Kwaj, SpaceX's engineers fueled up the Falcon 1 and crossed their fingers. The rocket had an air force satellite as its payload, along with a couple of experiments from NASA. All told, the cargo weighed 375 pounds.</p><p>2008年7月30日，“猎鹰9号”在得克萨斯进行了一次成功的启动测试，9个引擎全部点燃并且产生了85万磅的推力。3天后，在夸贾林岛，SpaceX的工程师们点燃了“猎鹰1号”，并开始祈祷发射成功。“猎鹰1号”火箭负载了空军的卫星和NASA的几台实验设备。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>SpaceX had been making significant changes to its rocket since the last, failed launch. A traditional aerospace company would not have wanted the added risk, but Musk insisted that SpaceX push its technology forward while at the same time trying to make it work right. Among the biggest changes for the Falcon 1 was a new version of the Merlin 1 engine that relied on a tweaked cooling system.</p><p>2008年8月2日，第一次发射实验在倒计时的最后一秒被临时终止。SpaceX立即重新部署，准备在同一天进行第二次发射。这次一切看起来都非常顺利。“猎鹰1号”在没有任何问题的情况下成功升上天空。加州的SpaceX员工们通过网络直播观看了发射全程，大家激动得欢呼起来。然而，就当一级箭体和二级箭体要进行分离时，火箭突然发生故障。事后人们分析发现，在分离的过程中，新的引擎突然产生没有预料到的巨大推力，导致一级箭体和二级简体相撞，从而造成火箭的顶端和引擎损坏。<sup>[6]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The first launch attempt on August 2, 2008, aborted at T minus zero seconds. SpaceX regrouped and tried to launch again the same day. This time everything seemed to be going well. The Falcon 1 soared into the sky and flew spectacularly without any indication of a problem. SpaceX employees watching a webcast of the proceedings back in California let out hoots and whistles. Then, right at the moment when the first stage and second stage were to separate, there was a malfunction. An analysis after the fact would show that the new engines had delivered an unexpected thrust during the separation process that caused the first stage to bump up into the second stage, damaging the top part of the rocket and its engine.*</p><p>SpaceX计划将这375磅的货物送入轨道。自上一次发射失败后，SpaceX对火箭进行了重要的改造。传统的航天航空公司为了降低风险不会轻易改变设计，但马斯克坚信，尽管应该尽力保证火箭能成功发射，但是SpaceX不断革新技术与之同样重要。“猎鹰1号”最大的变化就是更换了新版的、调整过冷却系统的“默林一号”引擎<sup>(Merlin 1)</sup>。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The failed launch left many SpaceX employees shattered. “It was so profound seeing the energy shift over the room in the course of thirty seconds,” said Dolly Singh, a recruiter at SpaceX. “It was like the worst fucking day ever. You don't usually see grown-ups weeping, but there they were. We were tired and broken emotionally.” Musk addressed the workers right away and encouraged them to get back to work. “He said, ‘Look. We are going to do this. It's going to be okay. Don't freak out,'” Singh recalled. “It was like magic. Everyone chilled out immediately and started to focus on figuring out what just happened and how to fix it. It went from despair to hope and focus.” Musk put up a positive front to the public as well. In a statement, he said that SpaceX had another rocket waiting to attempt a fourth launch and a fifth launch planned shortly after that. “I have also given the go-ahead to begin fabrication of flight six,” he said. “Falcon 9 development will also continue unabated.”</p><p>这次发射失败让SpaceX军心大乱。“看见人们的情绪在30秒内发生180度的转变，这太震撼人心了，”SpaceX的招聘负责人多莉·辛格<sup>(Dolly Singh)</sup>说。“那就像是世界末日。成年人一般不轻易哭泣，但是那天他们都开始呜咽。所有人都身心疲惫。”马斯克立刻赶来安慰员工并鼓励他们回到岗位继续工作。“他说，‘看，我们必须得完成它。不要害怕，一切都会好起来的。’”据辛格回忆，“他的鼓励具有神奇的魔力，所有人都冷静了下来，开始分析刚才发射失败的原因，并且试图解决问题。公司里死灰复燃，一切从绝望变回充满希望。”马斯克在公众面前的回应也充满了正能量，他在发言中称SpaceX计划用另一艘火箭尝试第四次发射，第五次发射也在紧密计划中。“我计划开始建造第六艘火箭，”他说，“‘猎鹰9号’计划毫无疑问也会继续下去。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In reality, the third launch was a disaster with cascading consequences. Since the second stage of the rocket did not fire properly, SpaceX never got a chance to see if it had really fixed the fuel-sloshing issues that had plagued the second flight. Many of the SpaceX engineers were confident that they had solved this problem and were anxious to get to the fourth launch, believing that they had an easy answer for the recent thrust problem. For Musk, the situation seemed graver. “I was super depressed,” </p><p>事实上，第三次发射失败带来了一连串的问题。因为第二级火箭没有正常启动，导致SpaceX无法确认他们是否真正解决了导致第二次发射全军覆没的燃料晃动问题。SpaceX的工程师们相信他们已经解决了这个问题，迫切地期待着第四次发射，至于导致第三次发射失败的推力问题，他们相信已经用简单的方法解决了。但之于马斯克，情况要严峻得多。“我当时非常压抑，”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk said. “If we hadn't solved the slush coupling problem on flight two, or there was just some random other thing that occurred—say a mistake in the launch process or the manufacturing process unrelated to anything previous—then game over.” SpaceX simply did not have enough money to try a fifth flight. He'd put $100 million into the company and had nothing to spare because of the issues at Tesla. “Flight four was it,” Musk said. If, however, SpaceX could nail the fourth flight, it would instill confidence on the part of the U.S. government and possible commercial customers, paving the way for the Falcon 9 and even more ambitious projects.</p><p>马斯克说，“如果我们没有解决第二次发射的燃料问题，又或者发射过程中出现了其他我们之前没有预料到的问题，就一切都完了。”SpaceX已经没有足够的资金进行第五次发射了。马斯克已经投入了一亿美元，并且因为特斯拉的缘故，他已经没有任何多余的经费了。“第四次发射是背水一战。”马斯克说。如果SpaceX能够在第四次发射成功，那意味着他们能够取得美国政府和潜在商业客户的信任，“猎鹰9号”和更多雄伟的计划才有机会被提上台面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Leading up to the third launch, Musk had been his usual ultra-involved self. Anyone at SpaceX who held the launch back went onto Musk's critical-path shit list. Musk would hound the person responsible about the delays but, typically, he would also do everything in his power to help solve problems. “I was personally holding up the launch once and had to give Elon twice-daily updates about what was going on,” said Kevin Brogan. “But Elon would say, ‘There are five hundred people at this company. What do you need?'” One of the calls must have taken place while Musk courted Riley because Brogan remembered Musk phoning from the bathroom of a London club to find out how welding had gone on a large part of the rocket. Musk fielded another call in the middle of the night while sleeping next to Riley and had to whisper as he berated the engineers. “He's giving us the pillow talk voice, so we all have to huddle around the speakerphone, while he tells us, ‘You guys need to get your shit together,'” Brogan said.</p><p>直至第三次发射，马斯克都一直保持着万分投入的状态。任何耽误发射的人员都会进入马斯克的黑名单，马斯克会训斥他们，要求他们为延期负责，但更多的时候，他会尽己所能去解决问题。“有一次我延误了发射，必须一天向埃隆报告两次具体进度，”凯文·布罗根说，“但是埃隆会对我说，‘公司里有500人可以帮忙。你到底需要什么？’”布罗根确信他和马斯克的通话至少有一通发生在马斯克追莱莉的时候，因为他记得马斯克有一次从伦敦俱乐部的浴室里打来电话，想了解火箭某个部分的焊接工作完成得怎么样了。而另一次通话发生在半夜，马斯克睡在莱莉身边，所以他只能轻声细语地训斥工程师们。“他说话的声音就像在枕边细语，所以我们所有人都得围着扩音器听他说，‘你们几个都给我认真点。’”布罗根回忆道。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>With the fourth launch, the demands and anticipation had ratcheted to the point that people started making silly mistakes. Typically, the body of the Falcon 1 rocket traveled to Kwaj via barge. This time Musk and the engineers were too excited and desperate to wait for the ocean journey. Musk rented a military cargo plane to fly the rocket body from Los Angeles to Hawaii and then on to Kwaj. This would have been a fine idea except the SpaceX engineers forgot to factor in what the pressurized plane would do to the body of the rocket, which is less than an eighth of an inch thick. As the plane started its descent into Hawaii, everyone inside of it could hear strange noises coming from the cargo hold. “I looked back and could see the stage crumpling,” said Bulent Altan, the former head of avionics at SpaceX. “I told the pilot to go up, and he did.” The rocket had behaved much like an empty water bottle will on a plane, with the air pressure pushing against the sides of the bottle and making it buckle. Altan calculated that the SpaceX team on the plane had about thirty minutes to do something about the problem before they would need to land. They pulled out their pocketknives and cut away the shrink wrap that held the rocket's body tight. Then they found a maintenance kit on the plane and used wrenches to open up some nuts on the rocket that would allow its internal pressure to match that of the plane's. When the plane landed, the engineers divvied up the duties of calling SpaceX's top executives to tell them about the catastrophe. It was 3 A.M. Los Angeles time, and one of the executives volunteered to deliver the horrific news to Musk. The thinking at the time was that it would take three months to repair the damage. The body of the rocket had caved in in several places, baffles placed inside the fuel tank to stop the sloshing problem had broken, and an assortment of other issues had appeared. Musk ordered the team to continue on to Kwaj and sent in a reinforcement team with repair parts. Two weeks later, the rocket had been fixed inside of the makeshift hangar. “It was like being stuck in a foxhole together,” Altan said. “You weren't going to quit and leave the person next to you behind. When it was all done, everyone felt amazing.”</p><p>第四次发射前，严苛的要求和紧张的期待让人们开始犯愚蠢的错误。一般来说，“猎鹰1号”的箭体会用驳船运输到夸贾林岛上。但这一次马斯克和其他工程师们心情急切，没有耐心等待漫长的海上运输，于是他租了一架军用货机，打算将火箭先从洛杉矶运送到夏威夷，再送达夸贾林岛。这是个好主意，但是SpaceX的工程师们却忘了考量舱压会对不足1/8英尺厚的箭体造成什么样的影响。当飞机在夏威夷准备降落时，机舱内的人们听到货物在窸窣作响。“我一回头，发现火箭的表面都变皱了，”SpaceX航空电子设备前主管布伦特·阿尔坦<sup>(Bulent Altan)</sup>说，“我让飞行员立刻将飞机升高，他照做了。”火箭就像是飞机上的空水瓶，两侧的大气压力使它不断变弯。据阿尔坦估算，在飞机被迫降落前，他们只有大约30分钟的时间解决这个问题。于是他们拿出口袋里的小折刀，将箭体外侧的热缩包装割开。接着他们发现飞机上有一个维修工具包，便用扳手把火箭上的一些螺丝拧开，好让内部气压与飞机尽量保持一致。飞机降落后，SpaceX的工程师们立刻打电话给公司高层，告诉他们运货过程中发生的灾难。那是洛杉矶时间凌晨三点，一位高管主动把这个糟糕的消息传达给了马斯克。当时大家认为需要花三个月才能将火箭修好，因为火箭有几处凹陷了，燃料箱里用来防止燃料晃动的隔板也断裂了，还出现了其他一系列问题。马斯克命令队伍继续前往夸贾林岛，同时派遣出携带修理配件的增援团队。两周后，火箭就在临时搭建的飞机棚里修好了。“那就像是所有人一起陷在战壕里，”阿尔坦说，“你无法全身而退，将他人弃之不顾。而当战争结束时，所有人都感到激动而开心。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The fourth and possibly final launch for SpaceX took place on September 28, 2008. The SpaceX employees had worked nonstop shifts under agonizing pressure for six weeks to reach this day. Their pride as engineers and their hopes and dreams were on the line. “The people watching back at the factory were trying their best not to throw up,” said James McLaury, a machinist at SpaceX. Despite their past flubs, the engineers on Kwaj were confident that this launch would work. Some of these people had spent years on the island going through one of the more surreal engineering exercises in human history. They had been separated from their families, assaulted by the heat, and exiled on their tiny launchpad outpost—sometimes without much food—for days on end as they waited for the launch windows to open and dealt with the aborts that followed. So much of that pain and suffering and fear would be forgotten if this launch went successfully.</p><p>SpaceX的第四次发射于2008年9月28日举行。SpaceX的员工们在此之前已经连续6周不停歇地轮班工作。他们作为工程师的骄傲、希望与梦想都在此一搏。“没能来到发射现场而在工厂里观看直播的人们都拼尽全力不要吐出来。”SpaceX的机械师詹姆斯·麦克劳里<sup>(James McLaury)</sup>说。尽管夸贾林岛上的工程师们把之前的发射都搞砸了，但是他们对这次发射非常有信心。他们之间的许多人已经在岛上工作了好几年，体验过人类史上超现实的工程师工作。他们远离自己的家人，在炎热的天气里被流放到发射岗位上——有时甚至没有足够的食物——静静等待每天发射结束后舱门打开，处理发射中止后的问题。如果这次发射成功，他们所经受的煎熬与汗水才没有白费。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the late afternoon on the twenty-eighth, the SpaceX team raised the Falcon 1 into its launch position. Once again, it stood tall, looking like a bizarre artifact of an island tribe as palm trees swayed beside it and a smattering of clouds crossed through the spectacular blue sky. By this time, SpaceX had upped its webcast game, turning each launch into a major production both for its employees and the public. Two SpaceX marketing executives spent twenty minutes before the launch going through all the technical ins and outs of the launch. The Falcon 1 was not carrying real cargo this time; neither the company nor the military wanted to see something else blow up or get lost at sea, so the rocket held a 360-pound dummy payload.</p><p>28日下午，SpaceX团队将“猎鹰1号”推上了发射台。它高高耸立，周围的棕榈树随风摇摆，湛蓝的天空飘过几缕云朵，让它看起来就像是来自小岛部落的某件奇特的艺术品。同时，SpaceX完善了网络直播策略，准备将每次发射过程都展示给公众。发射前，两位市场部高管又花了20分钟将发射中大大小小的技术问题全部介绍了一遍。这一次，“猎鹰1号”没有搭载任何货物，因为无论是公司还是军方都不希望再有东西爆炸或掉入海中，所以火箭搭载了360磅的虚设货物。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The fact that SpaceX had been reduced to launch theater did not faze the employees or dampen their enthusiasm. As the rocket rumbled and then climbed higher, the employees back at SpaceX headquarters let out raucous cheers. Each milestone that followed—clearing the island, engine checks coming back good—was again met with whistles and shouts. As the first stage fell away, the second stage fired up about ninety seconds into the flight and the employees turned downright rapturous, filling the webcast with their ecstatic hollering. “Perfect,” said one of the talking heads. The Kestrel engine glowed red and started its six-minute burn. “When the second stage cleared, I could finally start breathing again and my knees stopped buckling,” said McLaury.</p><p>SpaceX没有被赋予任何发射任务而仅仅是完成一次发射表演的事实并没有降低员工们的热情。当火箭节节攀升，SpaceX总部的员工们爆发出了热烈的欢呼声。接下来的每一个里程碑——离开这座小岛、引擎检查反馈显示一切正常——都伴随着欣喜若狂的口哨和喝彩声。在一级箭体脱离后，二级箭体经过90秒的启动开始飞行后，员工彻底陷入狂喜之中，整个网络直播室充满了他们欣喜若狂的叫喊声。“太完美了。”一位发言人欢呼道，二级箭体的引擎“茶隼”闪着红光，开始了长达6分钟的燃烧。“当燃烧结束后，我的膝盖终于不再颤抖，我感到自己又可以呼吸了。”麦克劳里说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The fairing opened up around the three-minute mark and fell back toward Earth. And, finally, around nine minutes into its journey, the Falcon 1 shut down just as planned and reached orbit, making it the first privately built machine to accomplish such a feat. It took six years—about four and half more than Musk had once planned—and five hundred people to make this miracle of modern science and business happen.</p><p>整流罩在发射后大约3分钟时打开并落回地面。最终，在9分钟的旅途过后，“猎鹰1号”按计划停止工作，世界上第一枚私人建造的火箭完成了此次壮举，进入了轨道。500个人花费了6年时间——比马斯克原计划多了四年半，终于创造了这个现代科学和商业的奇迹。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Earlier in the day, Musk had tried to distract himself from the mounting pressure by going to Disneyland with his brother Kimbal and their children. Musk then had to race back to make the 4 P.M. launch and walked into SpaceX's trailer control room about two minutes before blastoff. “When the launch was successful, everyone burst into tears,” Kimbal said. “It was one of the most emotional experiences I've had.” Musk left the control room and walked out to the factory floor, where he received a rock star's welcome. “Well, that was freaking awesome,” he said. “There are a lot of people who thought we couldn't do it—a lot actually—but as the saying goes, ‘the fourth time is the charm,' right? There are only a handful of countries on Earth that have done this. It's normally a country thing, not a company thing. . . . My mind is kind of frazzled, so it's hard for me to say anything, but, man, this is definitely one of the greatest days in my life, and I think probably for most people here. We showed people we can do it. This is just the first step of many. . . . I am going to have a really great party tonight. I don't know about you guys.” Mary Beth Brown then tapped Musk on the shoulder and pulled him away to a meeting.</p><p>为了分散自己的注意力并缓解巨大的压力，在发射的这一天马斯克和兄弟金巴尔以及孩子们一起去了迪士尼游玩。然后，为了赶上下午4点的发射，马斯克匆忙赶回公司，在发射前两分钟才踏进SpaceX的控制室。“发射成功后，每个人都流出了激动的泪水，”金巴尔说，“那是我人生中最激动人心的一天。”马斯克走出控制室，在工厂的走廊上受到了摇滚明星般的热烈欢迎。“那感觉真是太棒了，”马斯克说，“有许多人说我们不可能成功，事实上是很多很多人，但就算他们这样说，‘命运不会总和我们作对，第四次总该成功’，不是吗？世界上完成这种壮举的国家屈指可数，这种项目一般是由国家来完成的，而不是某家公司……我的脑子有点混乱，我什么都说不出来，但是，天啊！这绝对是我人生中最棒的一天！我想这里大部分人都这样想。我们告诉所有人我们做到了！这只是未来许多计划中的第一步……我不知道你们今晚如何庆祝，不过我要举办一场盛大的派对……”接着，玛丽·贝思·布朗拍了拍马斯克的肩，把他拉去开另一场会议。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The afterglow of this mammoth victory faded soon after the party ended, and the severity of SpaceX's financial hell became top of mind again for Musk. SpaceX had the Falcon 9 efforts to support and had also immediately green-lighted the construction of another machine—the Dragon capsule—that would be used to take supplies, and one day humans, to the International Space Station. Historically, either project would cost more than $1 billion to complete, but SpaceX would have to find a way to build both machines simultaneously for a fraction of the cost. The company had dramatically increased the rate at which it hired employees and moved into a much larger headquarters in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX had a commercial flight booked to carry a satellite into orbit for the Malaysian government, but that launch and the payment for it would not arrive until the middle of 2009. In the meantime, SpaceX simply struggled to make its payroll.</p><p>庆功派对结束后，这场胜利所带来的激情与喜悦渐渐褪去，卷土而来的则是SpaceX不容小觑的财务危机。SpaceX的“猎鹰9号”项目得到了更多支持，而另一艘计划未来能够给国际空间站运输物资，甚至某天能把人类送上太空的“龙”飞船也得到了生产许可。根据以往的经验，这之中任何一个项目的成本都在10亿美元以上，但是SpaceX必须找到方法用不到10亿美元的零头完成两个项目。同时公司的薪水大幅度提高，并且搬到了位于加州霍桑更大的总部。SpaceX已经签署了一份商业合同——为马来西亚政府发射一颗卫星，但是发射和付款都得到2009年中旬才能完成。在这之前，SpaceX得为了支付员工薪水而苦苦挣扎。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The press did not know the extent of Musk's financial woes, but they knew enough to turn detailing Tesla's precarious financial situation into a favored pastime. A website called the Truth About Cars began a “Tesla Death Watch” in May 2008 and followed up with dozens of entries throughout the year. The blog took special pleasure in rejecting the idea that Musk was a true founder of the company, presenting him as the moneyman and chairman who had more or less stolen Tesla from the genius engineer Eberhard. When Eberhard started a blog detailing the pros and cons of being a Tesla customer, the auto site was all too happy to echo his gripes. Top Gear, a popular British television show, ripped the Roadster apart, making it look as if the car had run out of juice during a road test. “People joke about the Tesla Death Watch and all that, but it was harsh,” said Kimbal Musk. “One day there were fifty articles about how Tesla will die.”</p><p>媒体不清楚马斯克的经济状况如何，但是他们对特斯拉岌岌可危的财政状况一清二楚，并以每日取笑消遣它不稳定的财务状况为乐。“汽车真相”<sup>(www.thetruthaboutcars.com)</sup>网站于2008年5月开设了一个名为“特斯拉死亡倒计时”<sup>(Tesla Death Watch)</sup>的栏目，并且发布了一系列文章。这些博文拒绝承认马斯克是公司的创始人，将他描述为从天才工程师艾伯哈德手中偷走了特斯拉的投资人兼董事长。当艾伯哈德在博客上谈论成为特斯拉顾客的利与弊时，得到了这个网站的大力支持。英国著名汽车电视节目《最高档》<sup>(Top Gear)</sup>将特斯拉批得一无是处，使它看上去好像还没上路就已经没电了。“人们像是看笑话一样关注‘特斯拉死亡倒计时’，但那其实非常残酷，”金巴尔·马斯克说，“有一天甚至同时出现了50篇谈论特斯拉会如何灭亡的文章。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then, in October 2008 (just a couple weeks after SpaceX's successful launch), Valleywag appeared on the scene again. First it ridiculed Musk for officially taking over as CEO of Tesla and replacing Drori, on the grounds that Musk had just lucked into his past successes. It followed that by printing a tell-all e-mail from a Tesla employee. The report said that Tesla had just gone through a round of layoffs, shut down its Detroit office, and had only $9 million left in the bank. “We have over 1,200 reservations, which manes [sic] we've taken multiples of tens of millions of cash from our customers and have spent them all,” the Tesla employee wrote. “Meanwhile, we only delivered less than 50 cars. I actually talked a close friend of mine into putting down $60,000 for a Tesla Roadster. I cannot conscientiously be a bystander anymore and allow my company to deceive the public and defraud our dear customers. Our customers and the general public are the reason Tesla is so loved. The fact that they are being lied to is just wrong.”*</p><p>紧接着，2008年10月<sup>(SpaceX发射成功后几周)</sup>，“硅谷八卦”重出江湖。它首讽了马斯克代替德罗里正式出任特斯拉CEO，理由是它认为马斯克过去的成功仅仅是因为好运。紧接着它发表了特斯拉的一位员工写给广大民众的一封邮件。这篇报道称特斯拉刚经历一轮裁员风波，关闭了其在底特律的办公室，并且银行里只剩下900万美元的资金。“我们有超过1 200份订单，这意味我们从顾客手里拿到的几千万现金全都被挥霍一空，”这名特斯拉员工写道，“同时，我们只交出了不到50辆车。事实上，我曾经说服了一位好友花6万美元购买特斯拉，我无法昧着良心做一个旁观者，任由我的公司继续欺骗广大群众和亲爱的顾客。特斯拉能够被簇拥都是因为这些顾客和群众，他们不应该被欺骗。”<sup>[7]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Yes, Tesla deserved much of the negative attention. Musk, though, felt like the 2008 climate with the hatred of bankers and the rich had turned him into a particularly juicy target. “I was just getting pistol-whipped,” Musk said. “There was a lot of schadenfreude at the time, and it was bad on so many levels. Justine was torturing me in the press. There were always all these negative articles about Tesla, and the stories about SpaceX's third failure. It hurt really bad. You have these huge doubts that your life is not working, your car is not working, you're going through a divorce and all of those things. I felt like a pile of shit. I didn't think we would overcome it. I thought things were probably fucking doomed.”</p><p>是的，绝大部分的负面关注是特斯拉理应承受的。马斯克却感到，2008年人们对银行家和富人的仇视心理将他变成了众矢之的。“我简直是被手枪轮番扫射，”马斯克说，“有很多人在幸灾乐祸，这在各个方面都对我十分不利。贾斯汀通过媒体来折磨我、媒体中总是出现特斯拉的负面报道，以及SpaceX第三次发射失败的报道，这对我来说是很大的伤害，让我严重怀疑自己的生活过不下去了，汽车做不下去了，自己正在经历离婚诉讼以及所有的这一切。我感觉自己一无是处。我觉得我们撑不下去。我觉得说不定一切都完了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Musk ran through the calculations concerning SpaceX and Tesla, it occurred to him that only one company would likely even have a chance at survival. “I could either pick SpaceX or Tesla or split the money I had left between them,” Musk said. “That was a tough decision. If I split the money, maybe both of them would die. If I gave the money to just one company, the probability of it surviving was greater, but then it would mean certain death for the other company. I debated that over and over.” While Musk meditated on this, the economy worsened quickly and so too did Musk's financial condition. As 2008 came to an end, Musk had run out of money.</p><p>当马斯克浏览SpaceX和特斯拉的财政状况时，发现只有一家公司有机会存活下来。“我只能选择SpaceX或者特斯拉中的一个，或者将资金分成两半，”马斯克说，“这是一个艰难的决定。如果我将资金分开，可能两家公司都没法活下来。如果我将资金全都给其中一家公司，它生存的概率会更高，但这也意味着另一家公司肯定要倒闭。我为此翻来覆去思考了许久。”就在马斯克苦苦思索时，美国的经济环境急剧恶化，马斯克的财政状况变得更加艰难。而当2008年进入尾声时，马斯克的钱用完了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Riley began to see Musk's life as a Shakespearean tragedy. Sometimes Musk would open up to her about the issues, and other times he retreated into himself. Riley spied on Musk while he read e-mail and watched him grimace as the bad news poured in. “You'd witness him having these conversations in his head,” she said. “It's really hard to watch someone you love struggle like that.” Because of the long hours that he worked and his eating habits, Musk's weight fluctuated wildly. Bags formed under his eyes, and his countenance started to resemble that of a shattered runner at the back end of an ultra-marathon. “He looked like death itself,” Riley said. “I remember thinking this guy would have a heart attack and die. He seemed like a man on the brink.” In the middle of the night, Musk would have nightmares and yell out. “He was in physical pain,” Riley said. “He would climb on me and start screaming while still asleep.” The couple had to start borrowing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Musk's friend Skoll, and Riley's parents offered to remortgage their house. Musk no longer flew his jet back and forth between Los Angles and Silicon Valley. He took Southwest.</p><p>莱莉开始将马斯克的人生看成一出莎士比亚悲剧。有时候马斯克会对她敞开心扉，但有时他又退回到自己的世界里。莱莉会暗中观察马斯克阅读电子邮件，当收到坏消息时，他会满脸愁容。“你会看到他在脑海中与自己对话，”莱莉说，“看见你爱的人如此煎熬是很痛苦的。”因为长时间工作以及不规律的饮食，马斯克的体重忽上忽下。他的眼睛下面开始出现眼袋，面容看起来就像是经历了超长马拉松后疲惫不堪的运动员。“他看起来就像是死神，”莱莉说，“我当时觉得这家伙会因为心脏病而死，他看起来像在死亡边缘徘徊。”马斯克经常半夜做噩梦并尖叫着惊醒。“他正在承受生理上的煎熬，”莱莉说，“他会在睡着的情况下，爬到我的身上开始尖叫。”这对夫妇必须得向马斯克的好友斯科尔借钱，莱莉的父母也愿意再次抵押他们的房子。马斯克不再使用他的私人飞机来往于洛杉矶和硅谷，他开始乘坐西南航空。<sup>(美国廉价航空。)</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Burning through about $4 million a month, Tesla needed to close another major round of funding to get through 2008 and stay alive. Musk had to lean on friends just to try to make payroll from week to week, as he negotiated with investors. He sent impassioned pleas to anyone he could think of who might be able to spare some money. Bill Lee invested $2 million in Tesla, and Sergey Brin invested $500,000. “A bunch of Tesla employees wrote checks to keep the company going,” said Diarmuid O'Connell, the vice president of business development at Tesla. “They turned into investments, but, at the time, it was twenty-five or fifty thousand dollars that you didn't expect to see again. It just seemed like holy shit, this thing is going to crater.” Kimbal had lost most of his money during the recession when his investments bottomed out but sold what he had left and put it into Tesla as well. “I was close to bankruptcy,” Kimbal said. Tesla had set the prepayments that customers made for the Roadsters aside, but Musk now needed to use that money to keep the company going and soon those funds were gone, too. These fiscal maneuvers worried Kimbal. “I'm sure Elon would have found a way to make things right, but he definitely took risks that seemed like they could have landed him in jail for using someone else's money,” he said.</p><p>由于每个月要花费400万美元左右，特斯拉需要完成新一轮融资才能够在2008年存活下来。为了给员工们支付每周的薪水，马斯克只能在和投资人周旋的同时求助朋友。他向每一个他想到的可能挤出一点钱的朋友发出了真诚的请求。比尔·李给特斯拉投资了200万美元，谢尔盖·布林也投资了50万美元。“许多特斯拉员工都为了帮助维持公司运转出了钱，”特斯拉的业务副总裁迪尔米德·奥康奈尔<sup>(Diarmuid O’Connell)</sup>说，“他们最终都变成了投资人，但在当时，这些就是有去无回的25 000美元或50 000美元。当时就像是要完蛋了，一切都要被毁灭了。”金巴尔在金融危机中损失了大部分资产，但他还是卖掉了自己所剩无几的财产来投资特斯拉。金巴尔说，“我当时快要破产了。”特斯拉向购买了Roadster的顾客收取了预付款，马斯克需要这些钱才能让公司继续运转，但是很快，这些资金也用完了。这种金融策略令金巴尔担忧，“我相信埃隆一定能让一切走上正轨，但是他确实冒着坐牢的风险挪用了他人的财产。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In December 2008, Musk mounted simultaneous campaigns to try to save his companies. He heard a rumor that NASA was on the verge of awarding a contract to resupply the space station. SpaceX's fourth launch had put it in a position to receive some of this money, which was said to be in excess of $1 billion. Musk reached out through some back channels in Washington and found out that SpaceX might even be a front-runner for the deal. Musk began doing everything in his power to assure people that the company could meet the challenge of getting a capsule to the ISS. As for Tesla, Musk had to go to his existing investors and ask them to pony up for another round of funding that needed to close by Christmas Eve to avoid bankruptcy. To give the investors some measure of confidence, Musk made a last-ditch effort to raise all the personal funds he could and put them into the company. He took out a loan from SpaceX, which NASA approved, and earmarked the money for Tesla. Musk went to the secondary markets to try to sell some of his shares in SolarCity. He also seized about $15 million that came through when Dell acquired a data center software start-up called Everdream, founded by Musk's cousins, in which he had invested. “It was like the fucking Matrix,” Musk said, describing his financial maneuvers. “The Everdream deal really saved my butt.”</p><p>2008年12月，马斯克同时启动了几项计划，试图挽救他的公司。他听到传闻说NASA即将为国际空间站签订一份补给合约，而SpaceX因为第四次发射成功，所以有机会赢得这份据称超过10亿美元的合约。马斯克动用关系提前接触了华盛顿方面，发现SpaceX可能是这份合约的头号候选人。于是，他不惜一切试图让大家相信公司有足够的能力克服困难，将太空舱送入国际空间站。而特斯拉方面，马斯克只能再次去请求现有的投资人，希望他们能在圣诞前夕再筹集一批资金以避免公司倒闭。为了给投资人一点信心，马斯克竭尽所能将自己仅剩的财产和资金投入了公司。在得到NASA的允许后，他从SpaceX借了一笔钱资助特斯拉。他试图在次级市场上卖出自己手上太阳能安装公司SolarCity的股份。他也在戴尔试图收购一家由其表弟创办、自己参与投资的数据中心软件公司Everdream时赚到了1 500万美元。“这听起来像是黑客帝国，”马斯克谈起自己的金融策略时说，“Everdream这笔买卖拯救了我的生意。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk had cobbled together $20 million, and asked Tesla's existing investors—since no new investors materialized—to match that figure. The investors agreed, and on December 3, 2008, they were in the process of finalizing the paperwork for the funding round when Musk noticed a problem. VantagePoint Capital Partners had signed all of the paperwork except for one crucial page. Musk phoned up Alan Salzman, VantagePoint's cofounder and managing partner, to ask about the situation. Salzman informed Musk that the firm had a problem with the investment round because it undervalued Tesla. “I said, ‘I've got an excellent solution then. Take my entire portion of the deal. I had a real hard time coming up with the money. Based on the cash we have in the bank right now, we will bounce payroll next week. So unless you've got another idea, can you either just participate as much as you'd like, or allow the round to go through because otherwise we will be bankrupt.'” Salzman balked and told Musk to come in the following week at 7 A.M. to present to VantagePoint's top brass. Not having a week of time to work with, Musk asked to come in the next day, and Salzman refused that offer, forcing Musk to continue taking on loans. “The only reason he wanted the meeting at his office was for me to come on bended knee begging for money so he could say, ‘No,'” Musk theorized. “What a fuckhead.”</p><p>马斯克自己筹集了近2 000万美元，并要求特斯拉现有的投资人——因为没有新客户愿意投资——也拿出同样多的资金。投资者们答应了他的要求。2008年12月3日，当他们在进行这轮融资的文书最终确认时，马斯克却发现了一个问题。创投机构VantagePoint Capital签署了所有的文件，但却没有在最重要的一页签字。马斯克立即致电VantagePoint的联合创始人及管理者艾伦·萨尔兹曼<sup>(Alan Salzmann)</sup>询问情况。萨尔兹曼回答公司对这轮融资有些疑问，因为他们降低了对特斯拉的估值。“于是我说，我有一个好主意。我已经把命运都押在了上面，我现在真的很难筹到钱。现在银行里的资金只够支付下周的薪水。所以除非你有别的主意，可以请你投入你认为合理的资金数量，或者尽力通过这轮融资以免公司破产吗？”萨尔兹曼犹豫不决，于是他让马斯克下周早上7点来公司直接向高层解释。等不及一周，马斯克请求第二天就去，但萨尔兹曼拒绝了他的请求，让马斯克只能继续靠贷款度日。“萨尔兹曼将会议设在自己办公室的唯一原因是，他希望我跪下来求他给钱，然后他就可以趾高气扬地向我说‘不’，”马斯克说，“真是个混蛋。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>VantagePoint declined to speak about this period, but Musk believed that Salzman's tactics were part of a mission to bankrupt Tesla. Musk feared that VantagePoint would oust him as CEO, recapitalize Tesla, and emerge as the major owner of the carmaker. It could then sell Tesla to a Detroit automaker or focus on selling electric drivetrains and battery packs instead of making cars. Such reasoning would have been quite practical from a business standpoint but did not match up with Musk's goals for Tesla. “VantagePoint was forcing that wisdom down the throat of an entrepreneur who wanted to do something bigger and bolder,” said Steve Jurvetson, a partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Tesla investor. “Maybe they're used to a CEO buckling, but Elon doesn't do that.” Instead, Musk took another huge risk. Tesla recharacterized the funding as a debt round rather than an equity round, knowing that VantagePoint could not interfere with a debt deal. The tricky part of this strategy was that investors like Jurvetson who wanted to help Tesla were put in a bind because venture capital firms are not structured to do debt deals, and convincing their backers to alter their normal rules of engagement for a company that could very well go bankrupt in a matter of days would be a very tough ask. Knowing this, Musk bluffed. He told the investors that he would take another loan from SpaceX and fund the entire round—all $40 million—himself. The tactic worked. “When you have scarcity, it naturally reinforces greed and leads to more interest,” Jurvetson said. “It was also easier for us to go back to our firms and say, ‘Here is the deal. Go or no go?'” The deal ended up closing on Christmas Eve, hours before Tesla would have gone bankrupt. Musk had just a few hundred thousand dollars left and could not have made payroll the next day. Musk ultimately put in $12 million, and the investment firms put up the rest. As for Salzman, Musk said, “He should be ashamed of himself.”</p><p>VantagePoint拒绝谈论这件事，但据马斯克说，萨尔兹曼的计策是为了瓦解特斯拉，使之破产。投资公司想要将马斯克驱逐出特斯拉，重组资产，让自己成为特斯拉的最大股东。接着他们就可以将公司卖给底特律的汽车制造商或者专注销售电子动力传动系统和电池组，而不是造什么电动汽车。“VantagePoint在逼迫一个怀有更广阔梦想的创业者忍气吞声、放弃梦想，”德丰杰<sup>(Draper Fisher Jurvetson)</sup>的合伙人及特斯拉投资人史蒂夫·尤尔韦松<sup>(Steve Jurvetson)</sup>说，“也许他们习惯了用这招儿逼CEO屈服，但埃隆不吃这一套。”相反，马斯克冒了一个更大的风险。特斯拉将这轮融资从股东权益融资变为债务融资，因为VantagePoint无法干涉债务融资。但棘手的是，德丰杰这类风险投资机构并不开展债务融资交易，对于一家几天内就可能倒闭的公司而言，说服投资人和银行改变投资策略是非常艰巨的任务。深谙游戏规则的马斯克决定虚张声势。他告诉投资人他可以再次从SpaceX借4 000万美元来完成这轮融资。他的战略奏效了。“如果机会变得稀缺，那么自然而然，人就会变得贪婪并且更感兴趣，”尤尔韦松说，“这也更便于我们回到公司说，‘现在情况就是这样，投还是不投？’”这轮融资最终完成于圣诞前夕，再迟几个小时特斯拉可能就要宣布破产。当时马斯克只剩下几十万美元，甚至无法第二天给员工支付薪水。最终，马斯克为这轮融资贡献了1 200万美元，剩下的部分都由投资公司提供。对于萨尔兹曼的行为，马斯克说，“他应该为此感到羞愧后悔。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At SpaceX, Musk and the company's top executives had spent most of December in a state of fear. According to reports in the press, SpaceX, the onetime front-runner for the large NASA contract, had suddenly lost favor with the space agency. Michael Griffin, who had once almost been a cofounder of SpaceX, was the head of NASA and had turned on Musk. Griffin did not care for Musk's aggressive business tactics, seeing him as borderline unethical. Others have suggested that Griffin ended up being jealous of Musk and SpaceX.* On December 23, 2008, however, SpaceX received a shock. People inside NASA had backed SpaceX to become a supplier for the ISS. The company received $1.6 billion as payment for twelve flights to the space station. Staying with Kimbal in Boulder, Colorado, for the holidays, Musk broke down in tears as the SpaceX and Tesla transactions processed. “I hadn't had an opportunity to buy a Christmas present for Talulah or anything,” he said. “I went running down the fucking street in Boulder, and the only place that was open sold these shitty trinkets, and they were about to close. The best thing I could find were these plastic monkeys with coconuts—those ‘see no evil, hear no evil' monkeys.”</p><p>与此同时，在SpaceX，马斯克和高管们在恐慌中度过了12月。根据媒体的报道，NASA合约的头号竞争者SpaceX突然失去了航天局的宠爱。曾经差点成为SpaceX联合创始人的迈克尔·格里芬成了NASA的新老大，开始处处针对马斯克。格里芬丝毫不关心马斯克咄咄逼人的商业策略，他认为马斯克打擦边球的行为不符合商业道德。其他人则猜测格里芬是嫉妒马斯克和SpaceX。<sup>[8]</sup>但是，2008年12月23日，SpaceX却收到了一个巨大的喜讯。NASA里的工作人员不断给格里芬做工作并最终成功帮助SpaceX成为国际空间站的供应商。SpaceX因此收到了16亿美元的款项，作为为国际空间站提供12次运输的费用。当时马斯克正和金巴尔一起在科罗拉多的博尔德度假，听闻SpaceX和特斯拉交易顺利，马斯克激动地流下了眼泪。“我之前甚至没有机会为妲露拉买件圣诞礼物，”马斯克说，“我跑到博尔德的街上，只有一家卖杂七杂八的小玩意儿的商店还开着，但当时它也快打烊了。我在那儿能找到的最好的东西是塑料的猴子和椰子——那些三不猴<sup>(三只猴子，一只捂眼睛，一只捂耳朵，一只捂嘴巴)</sup>。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Gracias, the Tesla and SpaceX investor and Musk's friend, the 2008 period told him everything he would ever need to know about Musk's character. He saw a man who arrived in the United States with nothing, who had lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters and his ex-wife and who verged on having his life's work destroyed. “He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I've ever met,” Gracias said. “What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else. He didn't just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.” That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk's main advantages over other executives and competitors. “Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias said. “Their decisions go bad. Elon gets hyperrational. He's still able to make very clear, long-term decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I've just never seen anything like his ability to take pain.”</p><p>对于格雷西亚斯来说，2008年让他充分了解了马斯克的品格。他亲眼见证了一个赤手空拳来到美国打拼、失去了一个孩子、被记者和前妻在媒体上狠狠羞辱、用尽毕生心血的公司处于倒闭边缘的男人。“他比我认识的任何人都更刻苦，并且能够承受更多压力，”格雷西亚斯说，“他在2008年所经受的一切可能早就让其他人崩溃了。他不仅仅生存了下来，并且持续专注于他的工作。”在危机中依旧专注工作的能力让马斯克在其他管理人员和竞争者中脱颖而出。“经历过那种压力的人大多数都退缩了，”格雷西亚斯说，“他们会出现决策失误。但是马斯克却变得更加理性，依旧能够做出清晰并且有远见的决定。压力越大，他做得就越好。任何见识了他所经历的一切的人都对他怀有敬意。我从未见过比他更坚毅的人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[1]</sup>在离婚期间，马斯克希望能够为自己正名，于是他在《赫芬顿邮报》<sup>(Huffington Pos)</sup>上发表了一篇1 500字的文章。马斯克声称，婚后协议是双方经过长达两个月的商谈后做出的决定。协议中双方的财产权是独立的，这样马斯克可以从自己的公司中获利，而贾斯汀可以从自己出版的书中获益。“在1999年中期，贾斯汀对我说，如果我向她求婚她就会答应，”马斯克这样写道，“因为这发生在我将自己的第一家公司Zip2卖给康柏，并且开始创立PayPal的时候，所以我的朋友和家人都建议我将双方财产分开，无论这场婚姻是因为爱还是金钱。”在一切尘埃落定后，马斯克让阿里安娜·赫芬顿<sup>(Arianna Huffington)</sup>将自己的文章从网站上删掉。“我不希望永远生活在过去的阴影之下，”马斯克解释自己的行为时说道，“人们总是能从互联网上找到许多东西，所以文章并不是消失了，只是不容易被找到而已。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[2]</sup>马斯克夫妇在孩子的教育问题上一直都存在问题。很长一段时间，马斯克都不直接和贾斯汀沟通他和孩子们的行程，而是通过他的助理玛丽·贝思·布朗来处理。“我对此感到非常生气。”贾斯汀说。当谈到孩子的生长环境对教育的利弊时，贾斯汀泣不成声。孩子们从小在一个不同寻常的环境里长大，去观看“超级碗”或者去西班牙时可以乘坐私人飞机，还能够在特斯拉的工厂里玩耍。“我知道孩子们都很崇拜马斯克，”贾斯汀说，“他带着他们到处参观，给他们带来了无与伦比的体验。而我作为母亲则是为了给孩子们增添一丝真实感，因为我所能给予他们的就是最日常的生活。他们有着一个不同寻常的父亲并且在一个不同寻常的家庭里长大。他们和我在一起时，过的是更加平稳真实的生活。我和马斯克有着不同的价值观。我给予孩子们更多的是情感。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[3]</sup>马斯克后来回忆起他们之间的第一次会面时说：“她确实很美，不过我当初心里不以为然，只当是几个模特。你也知道，你无法和大多数模特交谈，因为你们并没有什么话题可以聊。但是妲露拉对火箭和电动汽车很感兴趣，这使她与众不同。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[4]</sup>马斯克问莱莉要不要和他一起回家，但莱莉拒绝了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[5]</sup>当时，马斯克在航天航空领域已经是出了名的难相处。在“猎鹰9号”完成前，马斯克决定建造一个名叫“大猎鹰火箭”<sup>(Big Falcon Rocket)</sup> 的项目，并且希望这枚火箭能拥有史上最大的引擎。马斯克的雄心壮志和超前想法让SpaceX的一些供应商感到荒唐、震慑，但也印象深刻。这其中就包括以他偶尔会求助的以科罗拉多州为基地制造火箭涡轮泵引擎以及其他航天航空机器的巴伯·尼克斯公司<sup>(Barber NicolsInc.)</sup>。巴伯·尼克斯公司的执行官罗伯特·林登<sup>(Robert Linden)</sup>、加里·弗雷<sup>(Gary Frey)</sup>、麦克·弗沙<sup>(Mike Forsha)</sup>讲述了他们在2002年第一次与马斯克见面以及后续发生的故事，这里是其中一个片段：</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>“埃隆和汤姆·米勒<sup>(Tom Mueller)</sup>一起现身，然后开始谈论他希望能以更低的成本将火箭送上太空，完成我们的航天梦。我们知道汤姆是比较可靠的，但是我们不确定应不应该听从埃隆的想法。紧接着他们就开始要求我们完成不可能完成的任务：他们想要把成本控制在100万美元以内、用一年的时间建造一个涡轮泵。波音公司完成同样的项目大概需要5年的时间，成本约为一亿美元。但是汤姆让我们尽力而为，最终我们用13个月完成了。快速地学习并做出实物是埃隆的工作哲学，并且他坚持不懈地想要降低成本。无论我们以白纸黑字向他展示设计及其所需的材料价格是多少，埃隆总是要求降低成本，因为这是他商业模式的一部分。和他一起工作可能会令人非常恼火，因为他总有自己独到的见解并且不会妥协。我们觉得没有人能和他一起开心地工作。话虽如此，但埃隆一直忠于自己的商业计划并且实实在在地降低了航天工程的成本。波音、洛克希德以及其他公司都因为过分谨慎而花了太多钱。SpaceX确实胆量惊人。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[6]</sup>为了证明马斯克有多了解火箭，这里是他在6年后对发射失败的解释：“之所以发射失败，是因为我们将默林引擎升级成了再生冷却式引擎，从而导致引擎的推力瞬间增大了。其实，仅仅增加了1%的推力并延长了1.5秒的时间，而且燃烧室的压力增加了10PSI<sup>(磅/平方英寸)</sup>，是整体燃烧室压力的1%——小于海平面气压。在测试的时候，我们并没有注意到任何不妥。我们以为和测试时一样，正式发射也不会有什么问题，但事实上，两次却有着十分细微的差别。测试的时候，外围的海平面气压比发射时高，大约为15PSI，这掩盖了可能存在的问题。这些额外的推力导致第一级火箭在分离后继续向前冲，然后又一次撞上了第二级。接着第二级火箭启动了级间的引擎，导致等离子体回流将二级火箭也毁坏了。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[7]</sup>马斯克之后机智地发现了这名员工的身份。他将这封信的文本复制进Word文档，从而得知了文件大小。接着他将文件提交到打印机，然后在打印机的打印记录里找到了同样大小的文件。这样，他找到了打印原文件的员工。这名员工写了封道歉信后主动辞职了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[8]</sup>格里芬渴望建造一架新的大型宇宙飞船，从而巩固自己在这个行业的地位。但是随着奥巴马在2008年的美国总统选举中大获成功，被布什任命的格里芬知道他作为NASA主席的日子已经走到了尽头，而SpaceX看起来对建造最新奇、最领先的机器有着十足把握。</p></div>
