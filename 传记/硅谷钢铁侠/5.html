<div class='layout'><p>5 PAYPAL MAFIA BOSS</p><p>5 PayPal黑帮大佬：发动国际金融革命</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>马斯克想建立一个提供全程服务的网络金融服务机构：这家公司不但提供储蓄账户和支票账户服务，并且也从事经纪服务和保险业务。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>THE SALE OF ZIP2 INFUSED ELON MUSK WITH A NEW BRAND OF CONFIDENCE. Much like the video-game characters he adored, Musk had leveled up. He had solved Silicon Valley and become what everyone at the time wanted to be—a dot-com millionaire. His next venture would need to live up to his rapidly inflating ambition. This left Musk searching for an industry that had tons of money and inefficiencies that he and the Internet could exploit. Musk began thinking back to his time as an intern at the Bank of Nova Scotia. His big takeaway from that job, that bankers are rich and dumb, now had the feel of a massive opportunity.</p><p>成功出售初创企业Zip2公司让埃隆·马斯克信心倍增。就像他喜欢的视频游戏里的角色那样，马斯克升级了。他已经破解了硅谷并且成为那个时代人人都想成为的那种人——互联网百万富翁。他的下一次冒险必须跟上他那极速膨胀的野心。马斯克于是开始寻找资金充裕且效率低下、可为他和互联网所用的行业。马斯克想起他在新斯科舍银行实习时的经历——他从那份工作中取得的最大收获就是，银行家富有但愚蠢，他认为那个领域蕴藏着巨大的机会。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>During his time working for the head of strategy at the bank in the early 1990s, Musk had been asked to take a look at the company's third-world debt portfolio. This pool of money went by the depressing name of “less-developed country debt,” and Bank of Nova Scotia had billions of dollars of it. Countries throughout South America and elsewhere had defaulted in the years prior, forcing the bank to write down some of its debt value. Musk's boss wanted him to dig into the bank's holdings as a learning experiment and try to determine how much the debt was actually worth.</p><p>20世纪90年代初，在担任银行战略负责人工作期间，马斯克奉命查看公司在第三世界的债务组合。这笔资金被赋予一个令人沮丧的名字——“不发达国家债务”，而其中包括新斯科舍银行的几十亿美元。整个南美和其他不发达国家在此之前都有拖欠多年的未履行债务，迫使银行减记债务价值。马斯克的上司要求他深入了解银行所持有的这些债权，把这个过程当作一次学习实践，并尝试判断这些债务的真实价值。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While pursuing this project, Musk stumbled upon what seemed like an obvious business opportunity. The United States had tried to help reduce the debt burden of a number of developing countries through so-called Brady bonds, in which the U.S. government basically backstopped the debt of countries like Brazil and Argentina. Musk noticed an arbitrage play. “I calculated the backstop value, and it was something like fifty cents on the dollar, while the actual debt was trading at twenty-five cents,” Musk said. “This was like the biggest opportunity ever, and nobody seemed to realize it.” Musk tried to remain cool and calm as he rang Goldman Sachs, one of the main traders in this market, and probed around about what he had seen. He inquired as to how much Brazilian debt might be available at the 25-cents price. “The guy said, ‘How much do you want?' and I came up with some ridiculous number like ten billion dollars,” Musk said. When the trader confirmed that was doable, Musk hung up the phone. “I was thinking that they had to be fucking crazy because you could double your money. Everything was backed by Uncle Sam. It was a no-brainer.”</p><p>在执行这个项目的过程中，马斯克偶然发现了一个显而易见的商业机会。美国政府曾试图通过发行布雷迪债券为巴西和阿根廷这类国家的债务做担保，帮助一些发展中国家减轻债务负担。马斯克发现了一种套利的方法。“我计算了这些担保债券的价值，大约为50美分，而实际的交易价格是25美分，”马斯克说，“这是一个千载难逢的机会，而且没有人意识到这一点。”马斯克抑制住激动的心情致电证券市场上的主要交易商高盛，想一探究竟。他询问价格为25美分的巴西债务有多少。“电话那头的家伙问，‘你想要多少？’然后我说出了一个异想天开的数字——100亿美元。”马斯克说。当这个交易员确认交易可行的时候，马斯克挂断了电话。“我当时想这太疯狂了，你可以轻而易举地把钱翻倍。山姆大叔<sup>(Uncle Sum，被用来指代美国或美国政府)</sup>担保了一切。这是明摆着的事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk had spent the summer earning about fourteen dollars an hour and getting chewed out for using the executive coffee machine, among other status infractions, and figured his moment to shine and make a big bonus had arrived. He sprinted up to his boss's office and pitched the opportunity of a lifetime. “You can make billions of dollars for free,” he said. His boss told Musk to write up a report, which soon got passed up to the bank's CEO, who promptly rejected the proposal, saying the bank had been burned on Brazilian and Argentinian debt before and didn't want to mess with it again. “I tried to tell them that's not the point,” Musk said. “The point is that it's fucking backed by Uncle Sam. It doesn't matter what the South Americans do. You cannot lose unless you think the U.S. Treasury is going to default. But they still didn't do it, and I was stunned. Later in life, as I competed against the banks, I would think back to this moment, and it gave me confidence. All the bankers did was copy what everyone else did. If everyone else ran off a bloody cliff, they'd run right off a cliff with them. If there was a giant pile of gold sitting in the middle of the room and nobody was picking it up, they wouldn't pick it up, either.”</p><p>马斯克整个夏天都在打工，赚着14美元的时薪，还曾因为擅自使用高管的咖啡机及其他一些违规的事情遭到训斥。此时，他觉得自己一鸣惊人并大赚一笔的机会来了。马斯克冲进上司的办公室，兜售这个千载难逢的机会。上司让他写一份报告，这份报告很快便转交到银行CEO手中，而那位CEO却断然拒绝了这个提议，说银行之前已经被巴西和阿根廷的债务弄得焦头烂额，不想再管这个烂摊子了。“我想告诉他们，这不是重点，”马斯克说，“问题的关键在于，这些债务的背后支持者是美国政府。那些南美国家怎么做并不重要。除非你认为美国财政部会违约，否则你不可能遭受任何损失。他们最终还是拒绝，这反倒给了我自信。所有的银行家都做着和其他所有人一样的事情。如果其他人去跳崖，这些人也会跟着去跳崖。如果房间中央有一大堆黄金没有人去捡，这些人也不会去捡。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the years that followed, Musk considered starting an Internet bank and discussed it openly during his internship at Pinnacle Research in 1995. The youthful Musk lectured the scientists about the inevitable transition coming in finance toward online systems, but they tried to talk him down, saying that it would takes ages for Web security to be good enough to win over consumers. Musk, though, remained convinced that the finance industry could do with a major upgrade and that he could have a big influence on banking with a relatively small investment. “Money is low bandwidth,” he said, during a speech at Stanford University in 2003, to describe his thinking. “You don't need some sort of big infrastructure improvement to do things with it. It's really just an entry in a database.”</p><p>在随后的几年里，马斯克考虑开设网络银行，并于1995年在品尼高研究所实习期间公开讨论过这件事。年轻的马斯克面向科学家做了精彩的演讲，宣称传统金融业向互联网金融的转变是不可避免的趋势。但他们却试图驳斥马斯克的观点，说网络安全问题的解决尚需时日，而在这个问题解决之前不可能赢得消费者的青睐。然而马斯克仍然认为，金融业可以实现巨大的升级改造，并且他可以用相对较小的投资就能对银行业产生巨大的影响。“钱是低带宽的，”2003年，他在斯坦福大学的一次演讲上这样描述自己的想法，“你不需要通过改进大型基础设施去实现它。只要把资料录入数据库里就可以。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The actual plan that Musk concocted was beyond grandiose. As the researchers at Pinnacle had pointed out, people were barely comfortable buying books online. They might take their chances entering a credit card number but exposing just their bank accounts to the Web was out of the question to many. Pah. So what? Musk wanted to build a full-service financial institution online: a company that would have savings and checking accounts as well as brokerage services and insurance. The technology to build such a service was possible, but navigating the regulatory hell of creating an online bank from scratch looked like an intractable problem to optimists and an impossibility to more level heads. This was not dishing out directions to a pizzeria or putting up a house listing. It was dealing with people's finances, and there would be real repercussions if the service did not work as billed.</p><p>马斯克所策划的实际计划异常宏伟。就像品尼高的科学家指出的那样，人们只能勉强接受网上购书这种事情。他们或许会输入信用卡卡号，但让他们把银行账号暴露在网上则会让他们疑虑重重。但那又怎样呢？马斯克想建立一个提供全程服务的网络金融服务机构：这家公司不但提供储蓄账户和支票账户服务，并且也从事经纪服务和保险业务。从技术上来说，建立这个金融服务机构是可行的，但是仔细审视整个监管体系的现状就会发现，即使对于乐观主义者来说，要从无到有建立一家网络银行也是一个棘手的问题，而更多人则视其为不可能完成的任务。这不同于规划出比萨店的路线或者把住房分类广告上传至网络。这是和人们的财产打交道，一旦失败，将产生严重的影响。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Undaunted, Musk kicked this new plan into action before Zip2 had even been sold. He chatted up some of the best engineers at the company to get a feel for who might be willing to join him in another venture. Musk also bounced his ideas off some contacts he'd made at the bank in Canada. In January 1999, with Zip2's board seeking a buyer, Musk began to formalize his banking plan. The deal with Compaq was announced the next month. And in March, Musk incorporated X.com, a finance start-up with a pornographic-sounding name.</p><p>马斯克毫不气馁，甚至在把Zip2卖掉之前，他就已经将新计划付诸行动了。他跟公司里一些最优秀的工程师聊天，打探他们中有谁愿意加盟他的下一家公司。马斯克还向他在加拿大银行工作期间的同事征求意见。1999年1月，当Zip2的董事会寻找买家时，马斯克开始落实他的银行计划。一个月后，Zip2宣布被康柏收购。3月，马斯克组建了一家名字听起来有些色情的金融初创企业X.com。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It had taken Musk less than a decade to go from being a Canadian backpacker to becoming a multimillionaire at the age of twenty-seven. With his $22 million, he moved from sharing an apartment with three roommates to buying an 1,800-square-foot condo and renovating it. He also bought a $1 million McLaren F1 sports car and a small prop plane and learned to fly. Musk embraced the newfound celebrity that he'd earned as part of the dot-com millionaire set. He let CNN show up at his apartment at 7 A.M. to film the delivery of the car. A black eighteen-wheeler pulled up in front of Musk's place and then lowered the sleek, sliver vehicle onto the street, while Musk stood slack-jawed with his arms folded. “There are sixty-two McLarens in the world, and I will own one of them,” he told CNN. “Wow, I can't believe it's actually here. That's pretty wild, man.”</p><p>不到10年时间，马斯克从一个加拿大背包客成为一个27岁的百万富翁。他坐拥2 200万美元资产，很快便从和三个室友同住的宿舍搬了出来，购买了一套总面积1 800平方英尺、装饰一新的公寓。他还买了一辆价值100万美元的迈凯伦F1跑车和一架小型螺旋桨飞机，并开始学习开飞机。马斯克还把结交名人作为他互联网百万富翁生活的一部分。他让CNN<sup>(Cable News Network，美国有线电视新闻网)</sup>的记者早上7点来他的公寓拍摄跑车交付的那一刻。一辆黑色的18轮平板卡车停在他家门口，将一辆帅气的银色迈凯伦卸下并停放在大街上。而马斯克则双手抱胸站在那里，一副目瞪口呆的表情。“全世界仅有62辆迈凯伦，而我拥有其中的一辆，”他告诉CNN的记者，“哇，我真的不敢相信它就在我的眼前。这太疯狂了，伙计。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>CNN interspersed video of the car delivery with interviews with Musk. The whole time he looked like a caricature of an engineer who had made it big. Musk's hair had started thinning, and he had a closely cropped cut that accentuated his boyish face. He wore an all-too-big brown sport coat and checked his cell phone from his lavish car, sitting next to his gorgeous girlfriend, Justine, and he seemed spellbound by his life. Musk rolled out one laughable rich-guy line after another, talking first about the Zip2 deal—“Receiving cash is cash. I mean, those are just a large number of Ben Franklins”—next about the awesomeness of his life—“There it is, gentlemen, the fastest car in the world”—and then about his prodigious ambition—“I could go and buy one of the islands in the Bahamas and turn it into my personal fiefdom, but I am much more interested in trying to build and create a new company.” The camera crew followed Musk to the X.com offices, where his cocksure delivery led to another round of cringe-worthy statements: “I do not fit the picture of a banker,” “Raising fifty million dollars is a matter of making a series of phone calls, and the money is there,” “I think X.com could absolutely be a multibillion-dollar bonanza.”</p><p>CNN在马斯克的专访中插播了这段交付汽车的视频。整个过程中他看起来就像一个夸张的功成名就的工程师。马斯克的头发已经变得稀疏，而且短到紧贴着头皮的发型更加突出了他的娃娃脸。他穿着一件肥大的棕色运动外套，坐在豪车里玩着手机，旁边是他漂亮的女朋友贾斯汀，他似乎醉于自己的生活。马斯克说了一些引人发笑的富人专属台词，一开场就谈Zip2那笔交易。他说，“收到的现金都是货真价实的，我的意思是，大把大把的‘富兰克林’<sup>(100美元钞票上的头像是本杰明·富兰克林)</sup>。”接下来说的是他的生活有多么精彩——“就是它，先生，这可是世界上跑得最快的车”。再接下来谈的是他惊人的野心：“我本来可以去巴哈马买一个岛，再把它变成我的私人领地，但我对于创立一家新公司更感兴趣。”摄制组跟随马斯克来到X.com的办公室，在那里他又自以为是地吹嘘起来，这次更加耸人听闻：“我不符合银行家的固有形象”，“募集5 000万美元只需要打几个电话，然后钱就到位了，”“我认为X.com绝对是一个价值几十亿美元的富矿”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk purchased the McLaren from a seller in Florida, snatching the car away from Ralph Lauren, who had also inquired about buying it. Even very wealthy people like Lauren would tend to reserve something like a McLaren for special events or the occasional Sunday drive. Not Musk. He drove it all around Silicon Valley and parked it on the street by the X.com offices. His friends were horrified to see such a work of art covered with bird droppings or in the parking lot of a Safeway. One day, Musk e-mailed fellow McLaren owner Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of the software maker Oracle, out of the blue to see if he wanted to go race cars around a track for fun. Jim Clark, another billionaire who liked fast things, caught wind of the proposal and told a friend that he needed to rush over to the local Ferrari dealership to buy something that could compete. Musk had joined the big boys' club. “Elon was super-excited about all of this,” said George Zachary, a venture capitalist and close friend of Musk's. “He showed me the correspondence with Larry.” The next year, while driving down Sand Hill Road to meet with an investor, Musk turned to a friend in the car and said, “Watch this.” He floored the car, did a lane change, spun out, and hit an embankment, which started the car spinning in midair like a Frisbee. The windows and wheels were blown to smithereens, and the body of the car damaged. Musk again turned to his companion and said, “The funny part is it wasn't insured.” The two of them then thumbed a ride to the venture capitalist's office.</p><p>马斯克的这辆迈凯伦是从佛罗里达的一个经销商那里买的，并且是从著名时尚设计师拉夫·劳伦那里抢来的，当时劳伦也想买这辆车。即使是像劳伦这般富有的人也会有节制地使用迈凯伦，只用来出席一些特殊场合，或者偶尔星期天开出去。但马斯克不这样。他开着这辆车满硅谷跑，并且就把它停在X.com办公室旁边的大街上。他的朋友们惊恐地看到这样一件艺术品停在美国连锁超市西夫韦<sup>(Safeway)</sup>的停车场，或者车身被鸟屎覆盖。有一天，马斯克出人意料地给拉里·埃里森<sup>(Larry Ellison)</sup>——同样拥有迈凯轮的亿万富翁、软件公司甲骨文的联合创始人——发了一封邮件，问他愿不愿意去车道上玩赛车。而另一个喜欢极速体验的亿万富翁吉姆·克拉克<sup>(Jim Clark)</sup>获悉这一消息，告诉一个朋友他要去当地的法拉利经销商那里买车，以便参与赛车。马斯克已经加入了兄弟帮俱乐部。“埃隆对于这一切都感到超级兴奋，”马斯克的密友、风险投资人乔治·扎卡里<sup>(George Zachary)</sup>说道，“他把和拉里的通信内容拿给我看。”第二年，他们开车去见一个投资人，当行驶到沙山公路时，马斯克转过头对车里的一个朋友说，“看这个。”他将油门踩到底，变换了一个车道，因为变道太猛而撞上了路基，导致车辆失控，被抛到半空中像飞盘一样旋转。车玻璃和轮胎都撞成了碎片，车体也受损了。马斯克再次转过头对他朋友说，“有趣的是，这辆车没有保险。”他们于是拦了一辆车去了投资人的办公室。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>To his credit, Musk did not fully buy in to this playboy persona. He actually plowed the majority of the money he made from Zip2 into X.com. There were practical reasons for this decision. Investors catch a break under the tax law if they roll a windfall into a new venture within a couple of months. But even by Silicon Valley's high-risk standards, it was shocking to put so much of one's newfound wealth into something as iffy as an online bank. All told, Musk invested about $12 million into X.com, leaving him, after taxes, with $4 million or so for personal use. “That's part of what separates Elon from mere mortals,” said Ed Ho, the former Zip2 executive, who went on to cofound X.com. “He's willing to take an insane amount of personal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays off or you end up in a bus shelter somewhere.”</p><p>马斯克只是将他财富中的一部分用来打造他的花花公子形象。实际上，他把从Zip2赚到的大部分钱都投进了X.com。他之所以这么做，是因为有一个很现实的原因——根据税法规定，投资者如果在几个月之内把意外获得的资金迅速投入下一家企业，就可以钻税法的空子。但即使以硅谷的高风险标准来看，把新获得的巨额财富投入类似网络银行这种不太靠谱儿的项目也是很惊人的。马斯克向X.com投资了1 200万美元，纳完税以后只给自己留了400万美元。“这是埃隆异于常人的地方，”Zip2前高管、X.com联合创始人何艾迪说道，“他承担个人风险的意愿达到了近乎疯狂的地步，当你选择这么做的时候，要么大获成功，要么最后一无所有。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk's decision to invest so much money in X.com looks even more unusual in hindsight. Much of the point of being a dot-com success in 1999 was to prove yourself once, stash away your millions, and then use your credentials to talk other people into betting their money on your next venture. Musk would certainly go on to rely on outside investors, but he put major skin in the game as well. So while Musk could be found on television talking like the rest of the self-absorbed dot-com schmucks, he behaved more like a throwback to Silicon Valley's earlier days, when the founders of companies like Intel were willing to take huge gambles on themselves.</p><p>即使事后来看，马斯克当时决定向X.com投资巨额资金这一举措也是非同寻常的。1999年的互联网企业成功故事更多是这样的：证明自己一次，然后将赚来的几百万资金藏匿起来；接着利用这次成功经历从别人那里获得投资，用于创建自己的下一个企业。马斯克肯定会依赖外部投资者，但也会全身心地投入这个项目。尽管马斯克在电视上的言行举止无异于其他互联网时代的自大狂，但他的行为更像硅谷早期那些创始人——如英特尔等公司的创始人——愿意赌上自己的身家性命。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Where Zip2 had been a neat, useful idea, X.com held the promise of fomenting a major revolution. Musk, for the first time, would be confronting a deep-pocketed, entrenched industry head-on with the hopes of upending all of the incumbents. Musk also began to hone his trademark style of entering an ultracomplex business and not letting the fact that he knew very little about the industry's nuances bother him in the slightest. He had an inkling that the bankers were doing finance all wrong and that he could run the business better than everyone else. Musk's ego and confidence had started heading toward the levels that would inspire some and leave others thinking of him as pompous and unscrupulous. The creation of X.com would ultimately reveal a great deal about Musk's creativity, relentless drive, confrontational style, and foibles as a leader. Musk would also get another taste of being pushed aside at his own company and the pain that accompanies a grand vision left unfulfilled.</p><p>与Zip2条理清晰实用的理念不同，X.com的承诺更像是掀起了一场重大变革。马斯克第一次面对这样一个财大气粗又错综复杂的行业及其所有从业者，并希望一举颠覆它。最初，马斯克以其标志性的风格进入了一个错综复杂的领域，即使对行业知之甚少，他也并不感到困扰。他有一个粗浅的认识：那些银行家在金融领域所做的事情都是错的，他可以比其他人做得更好。马斯克的自尊心和自信心已经开始上升到另一个层次，有些人深受启发，而另一些人则觉得他言辞浮夸并且不择手段。X.com的创立使马斯克的创造力、不懈的努力、强硬的作风以及作为一个领袖的弱点显露无遗。马斯克也将体会到被自己公司排挤的另一番滋味，并因未尽的宏愿而感到痛苦。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk assembled what looked like an all-star crew to start X.com. Ho had worked at SGI and Zip2 as an engineer, and his peers marveled at his coding and team-management skills. They were joined by a pair of Canadians with finance experience—Harris Fricker and Christopher Payne. Musk had met Fricker during his time as an intern at the Bank of Nova Scotia, and the two really hit it off. A Rhodes scholar, Fricker brought the knowledge of the banking world's mechanics that X.com would need. Payne was Fricker's friend from the Canadian finance community. All four men were considered cofounders of the company, while Musk emerged as the largest shareholder thanks to his hefty up-front investment. X.com began, like so many Silicon Valley operations, at a house where the cofounders began brainstorming, and then moved to more formal offices at 394 University Avenue in Palo Alto.</p><p>马斯克为X.com组建了一个全明星团队。何艾迪曾经是硅图公司和Zip2的工程师，他的同行总是惊讶于他的工作能力。两个具有金融领域从业经验的加拿大人——哈里斯·弗里克<sup>(Harris Fricker)</sup>和克里斯托弗·佩恩<sup>(Christopher Payne)</sup>后来加盟了这支团队。马斯克与弗里克相识于在新斯科舍银行实习期间，两人一见如故。作为一个罗德奖学金获得者，弗里克为马斯克带来了X.com急需的银行领域专业知识。佩恩是弗里克在加拿大金融界的朋友。这四个人被认为是公司的联合创始人，马斯克因为巨额的前期投资而位列公司第一大股东。X.com就这样成立了，跟硅谷的许多公司一样，几个联合创始人先在一所房子里开始头脑风暴，再搬到位于帕洛阿尔托大学路394号一处相对正式的办公场所。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The cofounders were aligned philosophically around the idea that the banking industry had fallen behind the times. Visiting a branch bank to speak with a teller seemed pretty archaic now that the Internet had arrived. The rhetoric sounded good, and the four men were enthused. The only thing stopping them was reality. Musk had a modicum of banking experience and had resorted to buying a book on the industry to help understand its inner workings. The more the cofounders thought about their plan of attack, the more they realized the regulatory issues blocking the creation of an online bank were insurmountable. “As four and five months went by, the onion just kept unwrapping,” said Ho.*</p><p>几个创始人从哲学的高度讨论银行业已经落后于时代。在互联网时代，去银行办事要跟出纳员打交道已经过时了。他们的雄辩无懈可击，而几个创始人也是雄心勃勃。唯一可以阻止他们的就是现实。马斯克的银行业从业经验不够丰富，他还购买了有助于了解行业内部运作机制的书籍。几位联合创始人关于实施计划的思考越缜密，就越能认识到网络银行的监管问题是一道不可逾越的障碍。“四五个月过去了，我们仍然像在剥洋葱似的把问题一层层剥开。”何艾迪说。<sup>[1]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>From the outset, there were personality clashes as well. Musk had become a budding superstar in Silicon Valley and had the press fawning over him. This didn't sit that well with Fricker, who'd moved from Canada and pegged X.com as his chance to make a mark on the world as a banking whiz. Fricker, according to numerous people, wanted to run X.com and do so in a more conventional manner. He found Musk's visionary statements to the press about rethinking the entire banking industry silly since the company was struggling to build much of anything. “We were out promising the sun, moon, and the stars to the media,” Fricker said. “Elon would say that this is not a normal business environment, and you have to suspend normal business thinking. He said, ‘There is a happy-gas factory up on the hill, and it's pumping stuff into the Valley.'” Fricker would not be the last person to accuse Musk of overhyping products and playing the public, although whether this is a flaw or one of Musk's great talents as a businessman is up for debate.</p><p>一开始，几个创始人之间因为性格迥异而有过小摩擦。马斯克已经成为硅谷一颗冉冉升起的超级巨星，很多媒体开始追捧他。弗里克对此感到有些不安。他从加拿大移民至此创立X.com公司，是想在这个世界上成就一番事业，成为一名银行家。许多人都说弗里克希望采用较为传统的方式来管理X.com。弗里克认为马斯克向媒体发表的关于反思整个银行系统的言论不切实际，简直愚蠢至极，因为公司当时举步维艰，他说的一切还只是镜花水月。“我们承诺给媒体太阳、月亮和星星，”弗里克说，“埃隆会说这不同于普通的商业环境，你必须暂时摒弃常规的商业思维。他说，‘山上有一座制造幸福气体的工厂，它不断给硅谷打气。’”虽然弗里克不是最后一个指责马斯克产品宣传不实和愚弄大众的人，但这究竟是马斯克的缺点还是他的天才之处，仍然存在争议。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The squabble between Fricker and Musk came to a quick, nasty end. Just five months after X.com had started, Fricker initiated a coup. “He said either he takes over as CEO or he's just going to take everyone from the company and create his own company,” Musk said. “I don't do well with blackmail. I said, ‘You should go do that.' So he did.” Musk tried to talk Ho and some of the other key engineers into staying, but they sided with Fricker and left. Musk ended up with a shell of a company and a handful of loyal employees. “After all that went down, I remember sitting with Elon in his office,” said Julie Ankenbrandt, an early X.com employee who stayed. “There were a million laws in place to block something like X.com from happening, but Elon didn't care. He just looked at me and said, ‘I guess we should hire some more people.'”*</p><p>弗里克和马斯克之间的争论很快便以一场悲剧收尾了。在X.com成立仅仅5个月后，弗里克发动了一场“政变”。“他说要么让他担任CEO，要么他把公司里的每个人都带走，然后成立一家属于自己的公司，”马斯克说，“我才不吃胁迫这一套呢。我说，‘你赶紧去成立新公司。’于是他真的这么做了。”<sup>[2]</sup>马斯克试图说服何艾迪与其他核心工程师留下来，但他们选择与弗里克一起离开。马斯克最后只剩下公司的外壳和少数几位忠心的雇员。X.com的早期雇员朱莉·阿肯布兰特选择留在X.com。她说，“我记得尘埃落定之后，我坐在埃隆的办公室里”，“阻止创建类似X.com公司的法律条文有很多，但埃隆一点都不在乎。他只是看了看我，然后说道，‘我认为我们必须多雇一些人了’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk had been trying to raise funding for X.com and had been forced to go to venture capitalists and confess that there wasn't much in the way of a company left. Mike Moritz, a famed investor from Sequoia Capital, backed the company nonetheless, making a bet on Musk and little else. Musk hit the streets of Silicon Valley once again and managed to attract engineers with his rah-rah speeches about the future of Internet banking. Scott Anderson, a young computer scientist, started on August 1, 1999, just a few days after the exodus, and bought right into the vision. “You look back, and it was total insanity,” Anderson said. “We had what amounted to a Hollywood movie set of a website. It barely got past the VCs.”</p><p>马斯克一直在努力为X.com筹集资金，他不得不向风险资本家坦承公司的人才所剩无几。红杉资本公司的著名投资人迈克·莫里茨<sup>(Mike Moritz)</sup>决定无条件地支持这家公司，并在马斯克和他所剩无几的公司身上赌一把。马斯克再次开始在硅谷网罗人才，试图用他对未来互联网银行的激情演讲吸引工程师加盟。斯科特·安德森是一个年轻的计算机科学家，在工程师集体出走后没多久，他因看好这一领域的发展前景，于1999年8月1日加盟公司。“当你回首往事，你会发现这太不可思议了，”安德森说，“我们的网站就像好莱坞电影那样虚无缥缈，几乎不可能获得风险投资。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Week by week, more engineers arrived and the vision became more real. The company secured a banking license and a mutual fund license and formed a partnership with Barclays. By November, X.com's small software team had created one of the world's first online banks complete with FDIC insurance to back the bank accounts and three mutual funds for investors to choose. Musk gave the engineers $100,000 of his own money to conduct their testing. On the night before Thanksgiving in 1999, X.com went live to the public. “I was there until two A.M.,” Anderson said. “Then, I went home to cook Thanksgiving dinner. Elon called me a few hours later and asked me to come into the office to relieve some of the other engineers. Elon stayed there forty-eight straight hours, making sure things worked.”</p><p>几周过去了，随着越来越多的工程师加盟，公司的前景也变得越来越清晰。他们获得了银行牌照和共同基金许可证，并和巴克莱银行达成了战略合作伙伴关系。11月，X.com的小型软件开发团队创建了世界上第一家网上银行，不但由联邦存款保险公司<sup>(FDIC)</sup>为银行账户提供担保，还有三个共同基金供投资人选择。马斯克自掏腰包，拿出10万美元供工程师进行性能测试。1999年感恩节前夜，X.com正式向公众开放。“我在那里待到深夜2点，”安德森说，“然后我就回家去做感恩节晚餐，几个小时后埃隆给我打电话，让我回到办公室接替其他工程师。为了确保一切顺利，埃隆在那里连续待了48小时。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Under Musk's direction, X.com tried out some radical banking concepts. Customers received a $20 cash card just for signing up to use the service and a $10 card for every person they referred. Musk did away with niggling fees and overdraft penalties. In a very modern twist, X.com also built a person-to-person payment system in which you could send someone money just by plugging their e-mail address into the site. The whole idea was to shift away from slow-moving banks with their mainframes taking days to process payments and to create a kind of agile bank account where you could move money around with a couple of clicks on a mouse or an e-mail. This was revolutionary stuff, and more than 200,000 people bought into it and signed up for X.com within the first couple of months of operation.</p><p>在马斯克的指导下，X.com尝试了一些激进的银行理念。客户只要注册该服务，就能收到20美元的现金卡，如果将该服务成功推荐给朋友，还能额外收到10美元的优惠卡。马斯克还取消了各种零星的手续费和透支罚款。X.com开发了一个个人间支付系统，只需在网站上输入对方的电子邮箱地址，你就可以转账给他们——这是一项非常超前的革新。这个想法旨在变革发展缓慢的银行体系——银行的大型电脑主机系统完成一个支付周期需要花费几天的时间，并创建一种灵活的银行账户，此时人们只需点击几下鼠标或电子邮箱就可以转账。这是一项具有革命性的创新，在公司成立之初的那几个月，就有20万人接受了这个概念，并在X.com上注册了账户。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Soon enough, X.com had a major competitor. A couple of brainy kids named Max Levchin and Peter Thiel had been working on a payment system of their own at their start-up called Confinity. The duo actually rented their office space—a glorified broom closet—from X.com and were trying to make it possible for owners of Palm Pilot handhelds to swap money via the infrared ports on the devices. Between X.com and Confinity, the small office on University Avenue had turned into the frenzied epicenter of the Internet finance revolution. “It was this mass of adolescent men that worked so hard,” Ankenbrandt said. “It stunk so badly in there. I can still smell it—leftover pizza, body odor, and sweat.”</p><p>不久，X.com的一个主要竞争对手便出现了。麦克斯·列夫金<sup>(Maxlevchin)</sup>和彼得·蒂尔<sup>(Peter Thiel)</sup>创办了一家名为Confinity的公司，旨在开发属于他们自己的线上支付系统。这两个聪明的年轻人向X.com租了一间粉刷一新的杂物间，设法使Palm Pilot掌上电脑的持有人能够通过红外端口来支付。位于大学路上的这间小小办公室——在X.com和Confinity之间——成为一场互联网金融革命的狂热中心。“这么多年轻男性在这里辛苦地工作着，”阿肯布兰特说，“那里臭不可闻。我仍然记得那种味道——吃剩的比萨散发出的气味和体味、汗臭味混杂在一起。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The pleasantries between X.com and Confinity came to an abrupt end. The Confinity founders moved to an office down the street and, like X.com, began focusing their attention on Web and e-mail-based payments with their service known as PayPal. The companies became locked in a heated battle to match each other's features and attract more users, knowing that whoever got bigger faster would win. Tens of millions of dollars were spent on promotions, while millions more were lost battling hackers who had seized upon the services as new playgrounds for fraud. “It was like the Internet version of making it rain at a strip club,” said Jeremy Stoppelman, an X.com engineer who went on to become the CEO of Yelp. “You gave away money as fast as you could.”</p><p>X.com和Confinity之间的情谊很快便戛然而止。Confinity的创始人把公司搬到了沿街的一间办公室里，他们同X.com一样，也着眼于被称作PayPal的网页和电子邮件付款服务。为了能在产品性能上与对方相匹敌，并吸引更多的用户，两家公司展开了一场激烈的竞争，因为他们知道，只有又快又强者将最终获胜。促销活动花费数千万美元，防御黑客攻击又花费了数百万，这些黑客把网上银行业务看作诈骗活动的新战场。“这就像互联网版本的脱衣舞俱乐部的撒钱游戏，”杰里米·斯托普尔曼<sup>(Jeremy Stoppleman)</sup>说，“你要尽快把钱花掉。”他是X.com的一名工程师，后来成为美国点评网站Yelp的CEO。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The race to win Internet payments gave Musk a chance to show off his quick thinking and work ethic. He kept devising plans to counter the advantage PayPal had established on auction sites like eBay. And he rallied the X.com employees to implement the tactics as fast as possible using brute-force appeals to their competitive natures. “There really wasn't anything suave about him,” Ankenbrandt said. “We all worked twenty hours a day, and he worked twenty-three hours.”</p><p>赢得网络支付这场赛跑，让马斯克有了展示自己敏捷思维和职业风范的机会。他不停地制订计划，不断打击PayPal在诸如eBay等拍卖网站上建立起来的优势。他带领X.com的员工们雷厉风行且不择手段地执行这些策略。“他并非温文尔雅之人，”阿肯布兰特说，“我们每天工作20个小时，而他工作23个小时。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In March 2000, X.com and Confinity finally decided to stop trying to spend each other into oblivion and to join forces. Confinity had what looked like the hottest product in PayPal but was paying out $100,000 a day in awards to new customers and didn't have the cash reserves to keep going. X.com, by contrast, still had plenty of cash reserves and the more sophisticated banking products. It took the lead in setting the merger terms, leaving Musk as the largest shareholder of the combined company, which would be called X.com. Shortly after the deal closed, X.com raised $100 million from backers including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs and boasted that it had more than one million customers.*</p><p>2000年3月，X.com与Confinity终于决定不再彼此消耗而是形成合力。Confinity拥有看似最热门的产品PayPal，但因为每天要花费10万美元去奖励新用户，导致没有足够的现金储备维持运营。但X.com恰恰相反，他们拥有足够的现金储备和更加成熟的银行产品。马斯克牵头拟定了合并条款，并成为合并后新公司的最大股东，新公司的名字仍是X.com。合并完成后不久，X.com又从德意志银行和高盛集团等投资人那里获得了一亿美元融资。此时的X.com吹嘘自己已经拥有超过100万用户。<sup>[3]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The two companies tried hard to mesh their cultures, with modest success. Groups of employees from X.com tied their computer monitors to their desk chairs with power cords and rolled them down the street to the Confinity offices to work alongside their new colleagues. But the teams could never quite see eye to eye. Musk kept championing the X.com brand, while most everyone else favored PayPal. More fights broke out over the design of the company's technology infrastructure. The Confinity team led by Levchin favored moving toward open-source software like Linux, while Musk championed Microsoft's data-center software as being more likely to keep productivity high. This squabble may sound silly to outsiders, but it was the equivalent of a religious war to the engineers, many of whom viewed Microsoft as a dated evil empire and Linux as the modern software of the people. Two months after the merger, Thiel resigned and Levchin threatened to walk out over the technology rift. Musk was left to run a fractured company.</p><p>两家公司在企业文化啮合方面收效甚微。一批批的X.com员工将计算机显示器、桌椅和电源线打包在一起，再推到街对面的Confinity办公室，与新同事一起工作。但这两个团队却都看对方不顺眼。马斯克继续维护X.com品牌，而大多数人则偏爱PayPal。在公司技术基础设施的设计方面，双方产生了较多的分歧。列夫金领导下的Confinity团队更喜欢诸如Linux等开源软件，而马斯克则对微软的数据中心软件青睐有加，认为它更能维持高效。这类争吵在外人看来可能很愚蠢，但对于工程师来说却相当于一场宗教战争。他们中的很多人都视微软为邪恶帝国，而认为Linux是更能服务于人类的现代软件。两家公司合并两个月后，蒂尔宣布辞职，列夫金也因为技术分歧，扬言要出走。马斯克不得不独自运营一家支离破碎的公司。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The technology issues X.com had been facing worsened as the computing systems failed to keep up with an exploding customer base. Once a week, the company's website collapsed. Most of the engineers were ordered to start work designing a new system, which distracted key technical personnel and left X.com vulnerable to fraud. “We were losing money hand over fist,” said Stoppelman. As X.com became more popular and its transaction volume exploded, all of its problems worsened. There was more fraud. There were more fees from banks and credit card companies. There was more competition from start-ups. </p><p>X.com面临的技术问题随着用户的激增而日益恶化。该公司的网站每周都会崩溃一次，相关负责人要求大多数工程师开始设计一个新的系统，这项任务分散了核心技术人员的精力，并让X.com在网络诈骗行为面前不堪一击。斯托普尔曼说：“我们亏钱的速度快得惊人。”随着X.com越来越受欢迎，它的交易量暴增，这些问题就越发严重；银行和信用卡公司通过收取费用获得的利益就越多，初创公司所面临的竞争也就越激烈。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>X.com lacked a cohesive business model to offset the losses and turn a profit from the money it managed. Roelof Botha, the start-up's chief financial officer and now a prominent venture capitalist at Sequoia, did not think Musk provided the board with a true picture of X.com's issues. A growing number of other people at the company questioned Musk's decision-making in the face of all the crises.</p><p>X.com缺乏一个具有凝聚力的商业模式来抵消这部分亏损，并通过资金管理扭亏为盈。鲁洛夫·博塔<sup>(Roelof Botha)</sup>是这家创业公司的首席财务官，现在则是风险投资公司红杉资本一名出色的风险投资家。他认为马斯克没有告知董事会X.com的真实情况。越来越多的人开始质疑马斯克在面临危机时的决策能力。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What followed was one of the nastiest coups in Silicon Valley's long, illustrious history of nasty coups. A small group of X.com employees gathered one night at Fanny & Alexander, a now-defunct bar in Palo Alto, and brainstormed about how to push out Musk. They decided to sell the board on the idea of Thiel returning as CEO. Instead of confronting Musk directly with this plan, the conspirators decided to take action behind Musk's back.</p><p>接下来发生的是硅谷历史上最为臭名昭著的一场政变。在帕洛阿尔托一家已经不复存在的芬妮与亚历山大酒吧<sup>(Fanny & Alexander)</sup>里，一小群X.com员工聚集在一起，开始就如何推翻马斯克展开了头脑风暴。<sup>[4]</sup>他们决定怂恿董事会请蒂尔回来担任CEO。不同于跟马斯克直接交锋，列夫金和共谋者决定背着马斯克偷偷行动。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk and Justine had been married in January 2000 but had been too busy for a honeymoon. Nine months later, in September, they planned to mix business and pleasure by going on a fund-raising trip and ending it with a honeymoon in Sydney to catch the Olympics. As they boarded their flight one night, X.com executives delivered letters of no confidence to X.com's board. Some of the people loyal to Musk had sensed something was wrong, but it was too late. “I went to the office at ten thirty that night, and everyone was there,” Ankenbrandt said. “I could not believe it. I am frantically trying to call Elon, but he's on a plane.” By the time he landed, Musk had been replaced by Thiel.</p><p>马斯克与贾斯汀已经于2000年1月结婚，但因为一直太忙就把蜜月搁置了。9个月后的2000年9月，他们计划了一场集商务和休闲目的于一体的筹款之旅，并打算在奥运会主办城市悉尼度蜜月。就在他们登机的那天晚上，那些对马斯克失去信心的高管向X.com的董事会递上了请愿信。一些忠于马斯克的人感觉情况不妙，但为时已晚。“那天晚上10点半我去了办公室，发现所有人都在那里，”阿肯布兰特说，“我简直不敢相信。我发疯似的给埃隆打电话，但他在飞机上。”当飞机落地的时候，马斯克已经被蒂尔取代了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Musk finally heard what had happened, he hopped on the next plane back to Palo Alto. “It was shocking, but I will give Elon this—I thought he handled it pretty well,” Justine said. For a brief period, Musk tried to fight back. He urged the board to reconsider its decision. But when it became clear that the company had already moved on, Musk relented. “I talked to Moritz and a few others,” Musk said. “It wasn't so much that I wanted to be CEO but more like, ‘Hey, I think there are some pretty important things that need to happen, and if I'm not CEO, I'm not sure they are going to happen.' But then I talked to Max and Peter, and it seemed like they would make these things happen. So then, I mean, it's not the end of the world.”</p><p>当听到消息知道出事了，马斯克马上搭乘下一班飞机回到帕洛阿尔托。“这令人震惊，但我不得不承认他将这件事情处理得很好。”贾斯汀说。一开始，马斯克试图反击，他敦促董事会重新考虑这个决定。但是当他发现公司已经明显撇开他继续向前走的时候，马斯克的态度便缓和了。“我跟莫里茨和其他几个人交谈过，”马斯克说，“并不是我多想当CEO，而更多的是‘嘿，我觉得有一些重要的事情应该去做，如果我不是CEO，我不确定是否会有人去做这些事情’。然后我又去找麦克斯和彼得沟通，但他们似乎对此很有把握。所以，我的意思是这不是世界末日。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Many of the X.com employees who had been with Musk since early on were less than impressed by what had happened. “I was floored by it and angry,” said Stoppelman. “Elon was sort of a rock star in my view. I was very vocal about how I thought it was bullshit. But I knew fundamentally that the company was doing well. It was a rocket ship, and I wasn't going to leave.” Stoppelman, then twenty-three, went into a conference room and tore into Thiel and Levchin. “They let me vent it all out, and their reaction was part of the reason I stayed.” Others remained embittered. “It was backhanded and cowardly,” said Branden Spikes, a Zip2 and X.com engineer. “I would have been more behind it if Elon had been in the room.”</p><p>许多在X.com就与马斯克长期共事的早期员工，对于眼前发生的事情或多或少表现得无动于衷。“我的确感到消沉和愤怒，”斯托普尔曼说，“在我眼里埃隆就像摇滚明星一样。我虽然嘴上直言不讳发生的一切，但我也深深明白，公司现在的发展态势就像腾空的火箭，一切运转良好，这个时候我是不会打算离开的。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By June 2001, Musk's influence on the company was fading quickly. That month, Thiel rebranded X.com as PayPal. Musk rarely lets a slight go unpunished. Throughout this ordeal, however, he showed incredible restraint. He embraced the role of being an advisor to the company and kept investing in it, increasing his stake as PayPal's largest shareholder. “You would expect someone in Elon's position to be bitter and vindictive, but he wasn't,” said Botha. “He supported Peter. He was a prince.”</p><p>2001年6月，马斯克在公司的影响力迅速消退。当月，蒂尔将X.com更名为PayPal。马斯克通常都会睚眦必报，但这一次，他表现出了惊人的克制。他接受了作为公司顾问的角色，并继续向它注资以增加自己的股份，成为PayPal的最大股东。“你可以设身处地站在埃隆的位置去想，他更有可能愤恨和斗气，但他没有，”博塔说，“他支持彼得，表现得就像一个王者。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The next few months would end up being key for Musk's future. The dot-com joyride was coming to a quick end, and people wanted to try to cash out in any way possible. When executives from eBay began approaching PayPal about an acquisition, the inclination for most people was to sell and sell fast. Musk and Moritz, though, urged the board to reject a number of offers and hold out for more money. PayPal had revenue of about $240 million per year, and looked like it might make it as an independent company and go public. Musk and Moritz's resistance paid off and then some. In July 2002, eBay offered $1.5 billion for PayPal, and Musk and the rest of the board accepted the deal. Musk netted about $250 million from the sale to eBay, or $180 million after taxes—enough to make what would turn out to be his very wild dreams possible.</p><p>接下来的几个月对于马斯克的未来至关重要。互联网大潮迅速退去，人们都在想方设法套现。当eBay的高管开始接触PayPal商量收购时，大多数人倾向于尽快卖掉。马斯克和莫里茨敦促董事会拒绝大多数的收购要约，并采取观望态度以获得更高的价格。PayPal每年有2.4亿美元的营收，有望成为一家独立公司并寻求上市。马斯克和莫里茨的坚持获得了回报，而且收购价格提高了。2002年7月，eBay出价15亿美元收购PayPal，马斯克和董事会其他成员接受了这笔交易。马斯克从出售给eBay的交易中净赚约2.5亿美元，交完税后还有1.8亿美元。这笔钱足以实现他的那些狂野梦想。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The PayPal episode was a mixed bag for Musk. His reputation as a leader suffered in the aftermath of the deal, and the media turned on him in earnest for the first time. Eric Jackson, an early Confinity employee, wrote The PayPal Wars: Battles with eBay, the Media, the Mafia, and the Rest of Planet Earth in 2004 and recounted the company's tumultuous journey. The book painted Musk as an egomaniacal, stubborn jerk, making wrong decisions at every turn, and portrayed Thiel and Levchin as heroic geniuses. Valleywag, the technology industry gossip site, piled on as well and turned bashing Musk into one of its pet projects. The criticisms grew to the point that people started wondering aloud whether or not Musk counted as a true cofounder of PayPal or had just ridden Thiel's coattails to a magical payday. The tone of the book along with the blog posts goaded Musk in 2007 into writing a 2,200-word e-mail to Valleywag meant to set the record straight with his version of events.</p><p>PayPal的这段经历对于马斯克来说可谓悲喜交加。在那场交易后，他作为一个领袖名誉扫地，而媒体则第一次把矛头指向了他。埃里克·杰克逊<sup>(Eric Jackson)</sup>是Confinity的一名早期员工，他于2004年写了一本书，名为“PayPal战争：eBay战争、媒体、黑手党和其他的一切”，详细叙述了公司的动荡历程。这本书将马斯克描述成一个极端自私、故步自封的混蛋，在每一个紧要关头都会做出错误的决定；并将蒂尔和列夫金描绘成英雄般的天才人物。科技行业的小道消息网站“硅谷八卦”<sup>(Valleywag)</sup>也加入打击马斯克的行列。批评的声音开始出现，人们的质疑集中在一个方面——马斯克是否真的可以算作PayPal的联合创始人，还是只是躲在蒂尔的燕尾服后面，浑浑噩噩等着发工资。这本书连同那个博客网站的帖子，驱使马斯克在2007年写了一封长达2 200字的邮件给“硅谷八卦”，直接表明了他对这些事情的看法，以正视听。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In the e-mail, Musk let his literary flair loose and gave the public a direct look at his combative side. He described Jackson as “a sycophantic jackass” and “one notch above an intern,” who had little insight into the high-level goings-on at the company. “Since Eric worships Peter, the outcome was obvious—Peter sounds like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and my role is somewhere between negligible and a bad seed,” Musk wrote. Musk then detailed seven reasons why he deserved cofounder status of PayPal, including his role as its largest shareholder, the hiring of a lot of the top talent, the creation of a number of the company's most successful business ideas, and his time as CEO when the company went from sixty to several hundred employees.</p><p>在这封邮件里，马斯克向公众展现了他的文学天赋以及好斗一面。他形容杰克逊为“只会拍马屁的蠢驴”并且“只比实习生强一点”，对于公司高层的内幕一无所知。“埃里克找不到出版商，所以彼得资助埃里克自行出版了这本书，”马斯克写道，“埃里克对彼得的崇拜是显而易见的，结果彼得就像电影《勇敢的心》中的梅尔·吉布森，而我的角色则是无名小卒甚至是害群之马。”马斯克之后详细列举了7个原因，说明他的PayPal联合创始人地位实至名归——其中包括他的第一大股东的角色，对于顶尖人才的招聘，创造了公司许多成功的经营理念，在任职CEO期间公司规模从60人发展至几百人。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Almost everyone I interviewed from the PayPal days leaned toward agreeing with Musk's overall assessment. They said that Jackson's account bordered on fantasy when it came to celebrating the Confinity team over Musk and the X.com team. “There are a lot of PayPal people that suffer from warped memories,” said Botha.</p><p>几乎我采访的每一个曾供职于PayPal的人，都认可马斯克的看法。他们说杰克逊的书近乎天方夜谭，企图美化Confinity团队，矮化马斯克和X.com团队。“有许多PayPal的老员工因这段扭曲的回忆而愤怒不已。”博塔说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But these same people reached another consensus, saying that Musk had mishandled the branding, technology infrastructure, and fraud situations. “I think it would have killed the company if Elon had stayed on as CEO for six more months,” said Botha. “The mistakes Elon was making at the time were amplifying the risk of the business.” (For more on Musk's take on the PayPal years, see Appendix 2.)</p><p>但同样是这群人达成了另一个共识，马斯克对于品牌、基础技术和网络欺诈问题处理不力。“我认为如果埃隆再在CEO位置上待半年，公司就会完蛋，”博塔说，“埃隆犯的错增大了企业的风险。”<sup>(更多马斯克在PayPal时期的往事，见附录2。)</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The suggestions that Musk did not count as a “true” cofounder of PayPal seem asinine in retrospect. Thiel, Levchin, and other PayPal executives have said as much in the years since the eBay deal closed. The only useful thing such criticisms produced were the bombastic counteroffensives from Musk, which revealed touches of insecurity and the seriousness with which Musk insists that the historical record reflect his take on events. “He comes from the school of thought in the public relations world that you let no inaccuracy go uncorrected,” said Vince Sollitto, the former communications chief at PayPal. “It sets a precedent, and you should fight every out-of-place comma tooth and nail. He takes things very personally and usually seeks war.”</p><p>马斯克不能算作PayPal真正的联合创始人这一说法看起来愚蠢至极。蒂尔、列夫金和其他PayPal高管在eBay那笔交易完成后也多次说过类似的话。这些批评唯一的效果就是引发马斯克在公开场合的一次次反击，这些举动反映出马斯克的不安全感以及他对于自己历史地位的认真态度。“他对于公关领域一直有这样的看法：任何不准确的东西都必须得到纠正，”PayPal前首席联络官文森特·索里托<sup>(Vince Sollitto)</sup>说，“这件事是一个先例，你必须睚眦必报，连一个逗号都不放过。他认为这些事情都是针对自己的，经常动不动就向对方开战。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The stronger critique of Musk during this period of his life was that he had succeeded to a large degree despite himself. Musk's traits as a confrontational know-it-all and his abundant ego created deep, lasting fractures within his companies. While Musk consciously tried to temper his behavior, these efforts were not enough to win over investors and more experienced executives. At both Zip2 and PayPal, the companies' boards came to the conclusion that Musk was not yet CEO material. It can also be argued that Musk had become a hyperbolic huckster, who overreached and oversold his companies' technology. Musk's biggest detractors have made all of these arguments either in public or private and a half dozen or so of them said far worse things to me about his character and actions, describing Musk as unethical in business and vicious with his personal attacks. Almost universally, these people were unwilling to go on the record with their comments, claiming to be afraid Musk would pursue litigation against them or ruin their ability to do business.</p><p>这段时间对于马斯克更加强烈的批评是，他取得的成功主要靠运气。马斯克表现出的咄咄逼人的气势，以及自以为是的性格，在公司内部留下了深刻和持续的印象。尽管马斯克有意识地去修正自己的行为，但这些努力还不足以赢得投资者以及那些经验丰富的高管的信任。Zip2和PayPal这两家公司的董事会都得出了马斯克“不是当CEO的料”这样一个结论。也有评论认为，马斯克像一个夸张的推销员，总是自卖自夸自己公司的技术。马斯克那些最激烈的批评者已经在公开和私下场合抛出这些观点，其中有很多人跟我说过关于他的品行更恶劣的事情，指责马斯克是一个没有商业道德的人，经常恶语相向，发起人身攻击。这些人普遍不愿意我将这些评论具名写出来，声称是怕马斯克把他们告上法庭，或是毁了他们的生意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>These criticisms must be weighed against Musk's track record. He demonstrated an innate ability to read people and technology trends at the inception of the consumer Web. While others tried to wrap their heads around the Internet's implications, Musk had already set off on a purposeful plan of attack. He envisioned many of the early pieces of technology—directories, maps, sites that focused on vertical markets—that would become mainstays on the Web. </p><p>这些批评者必须仔细研究马斯克的成长足迹。在消费类互联网时代初期，他展现了自己一种与生俱来的能力——洞察人心与技术发展趋势。当别人还围绕着互联网的各种可能性裹足不前时，马斯克已经有了目的明确的进攻计划。他设想的许多早期技术——结合分类目录、地图和网站的垂直整合技术——将成为互联网发展的支柱。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then, just as people became comfortable with buying things from Amazon.com and eBay, Musk made the great leap forward to full-fledged Internet banking. He would bring standard financial instruments online and then modernize the industry with a host of new concepts. He exhibited a deep insight into human nature that helped his companies pull off exceptional marketing, technology, and financial feats. Musk was already playing the entrepreneur game at the highest level and working the press and investors like few others could. Did he hype things up and rub people the wrong way? Absolutely—and with spectacular results.</p><p>之后，正在人们习惯于在亚马逊和eBay上购物之时，马斯克打造了完善的网络银行，并在这个领域取得了飞跃。他将标准的金融工具引入互联网，让这个行业实现现代化，并注入很多新概念。他表现出了对人性的深刻洞察，帮助他的公司在营销、技术和财务各方面获得出色的表现。马斯克在创业者游戏中已经达到了最高等级，他与媒体和投资者打交道的能力也无人能出其右。他是否曾炒作并冒犯他人？当然，而且已经达到炉火纯青的程度了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Based in large part on Musk's guidance, PayPal survived the bursting of the dot-com bubble, became the first blockbuster IPO after the 9/11 attacks, and then sold to eBay for an astronomical sum while the rest of the technology industry was mired in a dramatic downturn. It was nearly impossible to survive let alone emerge as a winner in the midst of such a mess.</p><p>很大程度上正是基于马斯克的引导，PayPal才得以在互联网泡沫破灭后幸存下来，成为“9·11事件”后第一家重磅的上市公司，并在之后以天价出售给了eBay。而在当时，整个科技行业正处在剧烈衰退的泥沼中，连生存都几乎不可能，更不要说在乱世中成为赢家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>PayPal also came to represent one of the greatest assemblages of business and engineering talent in Silicon Valley history. Both Musk and Thiel had a keen eye for young, brilliant engineers. The founders of start-ups as varied as YouTube, Palantir Technologies, and Yelp all worked at PayPal. Another set of people—including Reid Hoffman, Thiel, and Botha—emerged as some of the technology industry's top investors. PayPal staff pioneered techniques in fighting online fraud that have formed the basis of software used by the CIA and FBI to track terrorists and of software used by the world's largest banks to combat crime. This collection of super-bright employees has become known as the PayPal Mafia—more or less the current ruling class of Silicon Valley—and Musk is its most famous and successful member.</p><p>而PayPal的创始团队也堪称硅谷历史上最伟大的商业和工程天才的组合。无论是马斯克还是蒂尔，都有着发现工程师领域青年才俊的敏锐眼光。初创企业如YouTube<sup>(视频网站)</sup>、LinkedIn<sup>(职场社交平台)</sup>和Yelp的创始人都在PayPal工作过。而另一批人——包括里德·霍夫曼、蒂尔和博塔，则成为科技行业的顶级投资人。PayPal员工为打击网络诈骗而首创的技术最后成为中央情报局和联邦调查局追踪恐怖分子的基石，这些软件还被世界上最大的银行用于打击犯罪。这群才华横溢的员工成为所谓的PayPal黑帮<sup>(PayPal Mafia)</sup>——他们如今或多或少可称得上是硅谷的统治阶层——而马斯克是其中最功成名就的成员。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Hindsight also continues to favor Musk's unbridled vision over the more cautious pragmatism of executives at Zip2 and PayPal. Had it chased consumers as Musk urged, Zip2 may have ended up as a blockbuster mapping and review service. As for PayPal, an argument can still be made that the investors sold out too early and should have listened more to Musk's demands to remain independent. By 2014, PayPal had amassed 153 million users and was valued at close to $32 billion as a stand-alone company. A flood of payment and banking start-ups have appeared as well—Square, Stripe, and Simple, to name three among the S's—that have looked to fulfill much of the original X.com vision.</p><p>事后来看，马斯克天马行空的想象力比那些谨慎务实的Zip2和PayPal高管要高明许多。如果Zip2按照马斯克的想法一直紧跟消费者市场，最后有可能发展成为地图和点评服务领域的中流砥柱。至于PayPal，我们可以得出这样的结论：投资人将公司出售得过早，应该听从马斯克的建议保持公司独立。到2014年，PayPal的累计用户数已经达到1.53亿，如果作为一家独立公司，其估值接近320亿美元。海量的提供网络支付和银行业务的创业公司已经出现——例如Square、Stripe和Simple，它们只是众多名称以S开头的公司中的三家——这些公司希望能够实现X.com最初的愿景。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>If X.com's board had been a bit more patient with Musk, there's good reason to believe he would have succeeded with delivery of the “online bank to rule them all” that he had set out to create. History has demonstrated that while Musk's goals can sound absurd in the moment, he certainly believes in them and, when given enough time, tends to achieve them. “He always works from a different understanding of reality than the rest of us,” Ankenbrandt said. “He is just different than the rest of us.”</p><p>如果当初X.com董事会对马斯克更有耐心一点，我们有充分的理由相信，他将会实现最初创立X.com时的“网络银行一统天下”的理想。历史已经证明，马斯克的目标在某个时间点听起来荒谬无比，但只要给他足够的时间，他总是能够无比坚定地实现它们。“比起其他人，他总是基于对现实的不同理解来开展工作，”阿肯布兰特说，“他就是那么与众不同。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While navigating the business tumult of Zip2 and PayPal, Musk found a moment of peace in his personal life. He'd spent years courting Justine Wilson from afar, flying her out for visits on the weekends. For a long time, his oppressive hours and his roommates put a crimp on the relationship. But the Zip2 sale let Musk buy a place of his own and pay a bit more attention to Justine. Like any couple, they had their ups and downs, but that passion of young love remained. “We fought a lot, but when we weren't fighting, there was a deep sense of compassion—a bond,” Justine said. The couple had been sparring for a few days about phone calls Justine kept getting from an ex-boyfriend—“Elon didn't like that”—and had a major spat while walking near the X.com offices. “I remember thinking it was a lot of drama, and that if I was going to put up with it, we might as well be married. I told him he should just propose to me,” Justine said. It took Musk a few minutes to cool down and then he did just that, proposing on the spot. A few days later, a more chivalrous Musk returned to the sidewalk, got down on bended knee, and presented Justine with a ring.</p><p>尽管Zip2和PayPal的业务起伏不定，但马斯克在他的个人生活里找寻到了一丝宁静。他远距离追求贾斯汀·威尔逊很多年，周末经常让她乘飞机来探望自己。在很长一段时间内，他繁忙的工作和他的室友使这段感情受阻。但是出售Zip2后，马斯克用赚到的钱买了一片属于自己的天地，并花更多心思在贾斯汀身上。跟任何情侣一样，他们的感情起起伏伏，但年轻时代的激情依然存在。“我们经常争吵，但是当我们不争吵的时候，我们之间有深深的共鸣可以维系我们。”贾斯汀说。这对情侣会因为贾斯汀持续接到前男友的电话而争吵几天——“埃隆不喜欢这样”。两人在X.com办公室附近散步时发生过一次严重的争吵。“我记得当时我想着我们共同经历的那些戏剧性的事情，如果我能够忍受这些，我们不如结婚。我告诉他，他应该直接向我求婚。”贾斯汀说。马斯克用了好几分钟冷静下来，然后他真的求婚了。几天后在那条小路上相同的地点，马斯克在贾斯汀面前像一名骑士一样单膝跪地，并送上了一枚戒指。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Justine knew all about Musk's grim childhood and the intense range of emotions he could exhibit. Her romantic sensibilities overrode any trepidation she might have had about these parts of Musk's history and character and centered instead on his strength. Musk often talked fondly about Alexander the Great, and Justine saw him as her own conquering hero. “He wasn't afraid of responsibility,” she said. “He didn't run from things. He wanted to get married and have kids early on.” Musk also exuded a confidence and passion that made Justine think life with him would always be okay. “Money is not his motivation, and, quite frankly, I think it just happens for him,” Justine said. “It's just there. He knows he can generate it.”</p><p>贾斯汀了解马斯克残酷童年的一切，以及他喜怒无常的性格。她的浪漫感情压倒了对于马斯克的过去和性格的诚惶诚恐，而是专注于他的超凡能量。马斯克经常深情地谈论亚历山大大帝，而贾斯汀则把他当作自己的盖世英雄。“他不惧怕承担责任，”她说，“他不会临阵脱逃。他很早就想结婚生子。”马斯克散发出的自信和激情，也让贾斯汀以为跟他在一起的生活会很美好。“赚钱不是他的动机，而且显而易见，金钱随之而来，”贾斯汀说，“钱这么来了，他知道自己可以赚钱。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At their wedding reception, Justine encountered the other side of the conquering hero. Musk pulled Justine close while they danced, and informed her, “I am the alpha in this relationship.”Two months later, Justine signed a postnuptial financial agreement that would come back to haunt her and entered into an enduring power struggle. She described the situation years later in an article for Marie Claire, writing, “He was constantly remarking on the ways he found me lacking. ‘I am your wife,' I told him repeatedly, ‘not your employee.' ‘If you were my employee,' he said just as often, ‘I would fire you.'”</p><p>在他们的婚礼上，贾斯汀发现了这个征服者的另一面。当他们跳舞的时候，马斯克把贾斯汀拉到跟前，告诉她，“我是这段关系的主导者。”两个月后，贾斯汀签署了一份婚后财产分配协议，这件事后来持续困扰着她，让她陷入了一场持久的权利斗争。几年后，贾斯汀在给《美丽佳人》<sup>(Marie Claire)</sup>杂志撰写的文章中描述道，“他反复评论我的缺点，‘我是你的妻子，’我反复告诉他，‘我不是你的员工。’‘如果你是我的员工，’他常常这么说，‘我就会解雇你。’”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The newlyweds were not helped by the drama at X.com. They'd put off their honeymoon and then had it derailed by the coup. It took until late December 2000 for things to calm down enough for Musk to take his first vacation in years. He arranged a two-week trip, with the first part taking place in Brazil and the second in South Africa at a game reserve near the Mozambique border. While in Africa, Musk contracted the most virulent version of malaria—falciparum malaria—which accounts for the vast majority of malaria deaths.</p><p>X.com的闹剧让这对新婚夫妇雪上加霜。他们本来就将蜜月延期了，后来又因为那次政变而夭折。直到2000年12月底事情逐渐平息，马斯克才开始了他几年中的第一个假期。他将两周的假期分为两部分，先去巴西，再去南非靠近莫桑比克边境的一个野生动物保护区。在非洲的时候，马斯克染上了最可怕的疟疾——热带疟疾<sup>(falciparum malaria)</sup>，是大多数疟疾死亡病例的罪魁祸首。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk returned to California in January, which is when the illness took hold. He started to get sick and was bedridden for a few days before Justine took him to a doctor who then ordered that Musk be rushed in an ambulance to Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City.* Doctors there misdiagnosed and mistreated his condition to the point that Musk was near death. “Then, there happened to be a guy visiting from another hospital who had seen a lot more malaria cases,” Musk said. He spied Musk's blood work in the lab and ordered an immediate maximum dosage of doxycycline, an antibiotic. The doctor told Musk that if he had turned up a day later, the medicine likely would no longer have been effective.</p><p>马斯克于2001年1月回到加州，然后病情开始显现。他病倒了，卧病在床好几天。贾斯汀之后带他去看医生。医生命令救护车将马斯克紧急送往位于红木城的红杉医院<sup>(Sequoia Hospital)</sup><sup>[5]</sup>。但那里的医生误诊了，错误的治疗方法让马斯克处于濒死的状态。“恰好另一家医院的访问医生见过很多疟疾病例。”马斯克说。那位医生仔细查看了马斯克的血液样本检测结果，下令以最大剂量给马斯克注射某种抗生素。医生告诉马斯克说，如果他晚一天就医，这种药就将无济于事了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk spent ten agonizing days in the intensive care unit. The experience shocked Justine. “He's built like a tank,” she said. “He has a level of stamina and an ability to deal with levels of stress that I've never seen in anyone else. To see him laid low like that in total misery was like a visit to an alternate universe.” It took Musk six months to recover. He lost forty-five pounds over the course of the illness and had a closet full of clothes that no longer fit. “I came very close to dying,” Musk said. “That's my lesson for taking a vacation: vacations will kill you.”</p><p>马斯克在重症监护病房度过了无比焦虑的10天。这段经历把贾斯汀吓坏了。“他本来壮得像坦克一样，”她说，“他的耐力和抗压能力无人可及。但我看见他躺在那里痛苦不堪的样子，就像是在另一个平行宇宙里似的。”马斯克花了6个月的时间才康复。他在生病期间体重减少了45磅，康复后整个衣柜的衣服都不合身了。“我那时候差点就死了，”马斯克说，“这是我从度假中得到的教训：假期会害死你。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[1]</sup>这些创始人一度认为，解决问题最简单的方式，就是买下一家银行，并对其进行改造。虽并未真的收购一家银行，但他们确实遇到美国银行的一名财务主管，这名主管反过来事无巨细地向他们解释了贷款资金来源、汇款和保护客户的复杂性。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[2]</sup>弗里克驳斥了关于他想担任CEO的说法，他说是其他员工怂恿他担此重任，因为马斯克此时无法让公司取得进展并为此感到苦恼。弗里克和马斯克曾交往甚密，仍旧对彼此没有好印象。“埃隆有自己的道德和荣誉标准，而且非常努力地执行这套标准，”弗里克说道，“对他来说，商场即战场。”马斯克说，“哈里斯很聪明，但并不善良，他非常强烈地想要主导全局，而且想要以他荒谬的方式来领导公司。”弗里克后来担任加拿大金融服务公司GMP资本的首席执行官，这段职业生涯可谓非常成功。佩恩则在多伦多创办了一家小型证券公司。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[3]</sup>X.com的投资人解除了马斯克的CEO职务，他们希望由经验更丰富的经理人领导公司完成首次公开募股。1999年12月，X.com聘请金融软件制造商Intuit的前CEO比尔·哈里斯<sup>(Bill Harris)</sup>担任新领导。合并后，公司上下突然开始把矛头对准哈里斯，董事会解除了他的职务，马斯克官复原职。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[4]</sup>受访的PayPal人员一致表示，Confinity主管戴维·萨克斯<sup>(David Sacks)</sup>是赶走马斯克的幕后主使。尽管有这段经历，这两个男人后来还是一起制作电影、继续往来，并共同致力于冒险的事业。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[5]</sup>在病了几天之后，马斯克去了斯坦福医院，并告诉医生，他从疟疾疫区回来，但医生通过检测报告没有发现寄生虫。医生给他做了脊椎抽液，诊断出他患有病毒性脑膜炎。“我很可能得了病毒性脑膜炎，他们针对这种病进行治疗，而且病情确实好转了。”马斯克说道。医生让马斯克出院，并提醒他有些症状会复发。“几天之后，我开始感觉不舒服，而且感觉越来越糟糕了，”马斯克说，“最终，我不能走路了。这就像是‘好吧，这甚至比第一次更糟糕’。”贾丝汀带马斯克搭乘出租车去找全科医生，他倒在医生办公室的地板上。“我脱水很严重，医生无法评估我的生命体征。”马斯克说道。医生叫了救护车，将马斯克送往红木城红杉医院。马斯克再度被误诊。医生拒绝对马斯克采用更加大胆的治疗手段，因为这种治疗方法的副作用非常严重，包括心悸和器官衰竭。</p></div>
