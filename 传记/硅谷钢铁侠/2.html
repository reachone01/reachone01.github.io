<div class='layout'><p>2 AFRICA</p><p>2 出生地非洲：冒险无极限的基因</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>马斯克家族在南非的历史可以一直追溯到200年前，比勒陀利亚的第一本电话簿上就有他们家庭成员的名字。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The South African trade publication PC and Office Technology published the source code to a video game Musk had designed. Called Blastar, the science-fiction-inspired space game required 167 lines of instructions to run. This was back in the day when early computer users were required to type out commands to make their machines do much of anything. In that context, Musk's game did not shine as a marvel of computer science but it certainly surpassed what most twelve-year-olds were kicking out at the time. Its coverage in the magazine netted Musk five hundred dollars and provided some early hints about his character. The Blastar spread on page 69 of the magazine shows that the young man wanted to go by the sci-fi-author-sounding name E. R. Musk and that he already had visions of grand conquests dancing in his head. The brief explainer states, “In this game you have to destroy an alien space freighter, which is carrying deadly Hydrogen Bombs and Status Beam Machines. This game makes good use of sprites and animation, and in this sense makes the listing worth reading.” (As of this writing, not even the Internet knows what “status beam machines” are.)</p><p>埃隆·马斯克第一次走进公众视野是在1984年。南非一本名为“个人计算机和办公技术”的刊物发布了马斯克设计的一款游戏源代码。这款游戏名为“炸弹”<sup>(Blastar)</sup>，灵感来源于科幻小说的太空场景，需要运行167行代码。在个人计算机时代早期，用户需要键入所有的指令才能让机器运行某个程序。在这个背景之下，马斯克设计的这款游戏在计算机界并非出类拔萃，但显然超过了绝大多数12岁的孩子。这篇封面报道让马斯克赚到500美元，从中也可以看到他性格的一些端倪。这份关于Blaster的杂志第69页写道，这个年轻人给自己取了一个听起来像科幻作家的名字E·R·马斯克<sup>(E.R.Musk)</sup>，并且他已经在头脑中形成了伟大的征服计划。作者简单解释说，“在这个游戏里，你必须摧毁外星人的太空舰队，它们携带了致命的氢弹和状态光柱机<sup>(Status Beam Machines)</sup>。这个游戏充分运用了精灵和动画，从这个意义上来说，这些信息值得一读。”<sup>(在撰写本文时，甚至互联网上都查不到“状态光柱机”究竟是什么。)</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>A boy fantasizing about space and battles between good and evil is anything but amazing. A boy who takes these fantasies seriously is more remarkable. Such was the case with the young Elon Musk. By the middle of his teenage years, Musk had blended fantasy and reality to the point that they were hard to separate in his mind. Musk came to see man's fate in the universe as a personal obligation. If that meant pursuing cleaner energy technology or building spaceships to extend the human species's reach, then so be it. Musk would find a way to make these things happen. “Maybe I read too many comics as a kid,” Musk said. “In the comics, it always seems like they are trying to save the world. It seemed like one should try to make the world a better place because the inverse makes no sense.”</p><p>一个男孩儿幻想着太空和正邪之战不足为奇，可如果这个男孩儿严肃认真地对待这些幻想，就太让人不可思议了。马斯克就属于这种情况。在15岁左右的时候，他就已经很难将幻想和现实区分开来了。马斯克把人类在宇宙的征程看作个人的使命。如果人类必须寻找更加清洁的能源或者建造宇宙飞船去拓展人类的生存空间，那就去做吧。马斯克千方百计地想要让这些事情变成现实。“可能是因为我小时候看了太多漫画的缘故吧，”马斯克说，“在漫画里，英雄必须要拯救世界，必须让世界更美好，因为相反的做法没有任何意义。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At around age fourteen, Musk had a full-on existential crisis. He tried to deal with it like many gifted adolescents do, turning to religious and philosophical texts. Musk sampled a handful of ideologies and then ended up more or less back where he had started, embracing the sci-fi lessons found in one of the most influential books in his life: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. “He points out that one of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask,” Musk said. “Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy. I came to the conclusion that really we should aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask.” The teenage Musk then arrived at his ultralogical mission statement. “The only thing that makes sense to do is strive for greater collective enlightenment,” he said.</p><p>到了14岁的时候，马斯克经历了一段严重的生存危机。他像很多天赋异禀的少年那样，转而向宗教和哲学寻找答案。他掌握了不少意识形态方面的知识，然后或多或少地回到现实生活中去寻找答案。在这期间他接触到了对他人生影响最大的一本科幻小说——道格拉斯·亚当斯<sup>(Douglas Adams)</sup>写的《银河系漫游指南》<sup>(The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)</sup>。“作者在书中指出了最困难的部分是提出问题。”马斯克说，“一旦你了解了问题所在，答案就变得相对简单了。我从中得出结论，认为我们应该立志去增强人类的自我意识，这样才能更好地去理解问题所在。”少年马斯克那时就已经做出了自己的超逻辑使命宣言。“唯一有意义的事情就是去为人类争取更大的集体启蒙。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>It's easy enough to spot some of the underpinnings of Musk's search for purpose. Born in 1971, he grew up in Pretoria, a large city in the northeastern part of South Africa, just an hour's drive from Johannesburg. </p><p>从马斯克的成长经历当中，我们能够很容易理解他所追寻的目标。他出生于1971年，在比勒陀利亚长大。这是南非东北部的一个大城市，与约翰内斯堡只有一个小时车程。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p>像马斯克家族这种富裕的白人家庭，他们在南非的生活方式虽然殷实但有污点。他的生活起居由一队黑人管家细心照料。南非上流社会的优越生活方式被贴上享乐的标签。他们总爱举办梦幻般的派对，在后院烤着羊羔肉，喝着品种繁多的葡萄酒，与此同时，女佣们照顾着孩子，而非洲舞者则要一直表演到深夜；周遭的自然环境美不胜收。跟西方比起来，这里的人们对于时间的感觉更加随意。南非的一句流行语“就在刚才”<sup>(just now)</sup>，意味着从五分钟到五个小时不等的时间。这里给人的整体感觉是自由奔放，伴随着非洲大陆的原始和粗犷。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The specter of apartheid was present throughout his childhood, as South Africa frequently boiled over with tension and violence. Blacks and whites clashed, as did blacks of different tribes. Musk turned four years old just days after the Soweto Uprising, in which hundreds of black students died while protesting decrees of the white government. For years South Africa faced sanctions imposed by other nations due to its racist policies. Musk had the luxury of traveling abroad during his childhood and would have gotten a flavor for how outsiders viewed South Africa.</p><p>然而，祥和美景之下，却潜隐藏着种族主义的幽灵。南非经常爆发流血冲突，有时候发生在黑人和白人之间，有时候则发生在不同部落的黑人之间。马斯克的童年正值种族隔离最血腥和最令人发指的年代。索韦托起义<sup>(Soweto Uprising)</sup>爆发的时候，马斯克刚满4岁，在那场事件中，有数百名黑人学生因为抗议白人政府的法令而遇害。多年来，由于实行种族主义政策，南非面临着国际社会的制裁。马斯克在童年时期去国外旅游时，就已经体会到外人是如何看待南非的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>But what had even more of an impact on Musk's personality was the white Afrikaner culture so prevalent in Pretoria and the surrounding areas. Hypermasculine behavior was celebrated and tough jocks were revered. While Musk enjoyed a level of privilege, he lived as an outsider whose reserved personality and geeky inclinations ran against the prevailing attitudes of the time. </p><p>南非的白人孩子在这段时间里明显会感到羞愧，他们明白自己的国家做了错事。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>His notion that something about the world had gone awry received constant reinforcement, and Musk, almost from his earliest days, plotted an escape from his surroundings and dreamed of a place that would allow his personality and dreams to flourish. He saw America in its most clichéd form, as the land of opportunity and the most likely stage for making the realization of his dreams possible. This is how it came to pass that a lonesome, gawky South African boy who talked with the utmost sincerity about pursuing “collective enlightenment” ended up as America's most adventurous industrialist.</p><p>马斯克关于人类需要拯救的信念不断加强。但是他从一开始就不单单只考虑南非的迫切需求，而是将全人类看作一个整体。在一些陈词滥调的熏陶下，他将美国看作充满机遇和梦想成真的土地。这就是为什么一个孤僻而笨拙的南非男孩儿，怀着最大的诚意去追寻人类的“集体启蒙”，最后却成为美国最具冒险精神的实业家。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Musk did finally reach the United States in his twenties, it marked a return to his ancestral roots. Family trees suggest that ancestors bearing the Swiss German surname of Haldeman on the maternal side of Musk's family left Europe for New York during the Revolutionary War. From New York, they spread out to the prairies of the Midwest—Illinois and Minnesota, in particular. “We had people that fought on both sides of the Civil War apparently and were a family of farmers,” said Scott Haldeman, Musk's uncle and the unofficial family historian.</p><p>马斯克在20多岁时到达美国，这实际上标志着他认祖归宗了。据族谱显示，马斯克母系祖先在美国独立战争期间从欧洲来到纽约，他们有着瑞士德语的姓氏霍尔德曼<sup>(Haldeman)</sup>。从纽约，他们又分散到了中西部的大草原——伊利诺伊州和明尼苏达州尤其众多。“在南北战争期间，我们的家族成员既有南方军，也有北方军，显然他们都是来自农民家庭。”马斯克的舅舅、非正式家族历史学家斯科特·霍尔德曼说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Throughout his childhood, boys teased Musk because of his unusual name. He earned the first part of it from his great-grandfather John Elon Haldeman, who was born in 18721 and grew up in Illinois before heading to Minnesota. There he would meet his wife, Almeda Jane Norman, who was five years younger. By 1902, the couple had settled down in a log cabin in the central Minnesota town of Pequot and given birth to their son Joshua Norman Haldeman, Musk's grandfather. He would grow up to become an eccentric and exceptional man and a model for Musk.*</p><p>在童年时期，男孩儿们总是取笑马斯克不同寻常的名字。这个名字最早来自于他的外曾祖父约翰·埃隆·霍尔德曼。约翰出生于1872年，在伊利诺伊州长大，后来又来到明尼苏达州生活。在那里，他遇到了后来的妻子，比他小五岁的阿尔梅达·简·诺曼。1902年，夫妻二人在明尼苏达州中部小镇佩科特的一间小木屋里安顿下来，并生下了儿子约书亚·诺曼·霍尔德曼，也就是马斯克的外祖父。约书亚后来成长为一个古怪又特立独行的人，并最终成为马斯克心中的偶像。<sup>[1]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Joshua Norman Haldeman is described as an athletic, self-reliant boy. In 1907, his family moved to the prairies of Saskatchewan, and his father died shortly thereafter when Joshua was just seven, leaving the boy to help run the house. He took to the wide-open land and picked up bronco horseback riding, boxing, and wrestling. Haldeman would break in horses for local farmers, often hurting himself in the process, and he organized one of Canada's first rodeos. Family pictures show Joshua dressed in a decorative pair of chaps demonstrating his rope-spinning skills. As a teenager, Haldeman left home to get a degree from the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Iowa and then returned to Saskatchewan to become a farmer.</p><p>约书亚·诺曼·霍尔德曼小时候是一个体格矫健且独立的男孩儿。1907年，他们举家搬到萨斯喀彻温省的草原。在他刚满7岁的时候，父亲就去世了，于是他便开始帮忙维持家庭生计。约书亚很快就学会了开垦荒地、驯养野马、拳击和摔跤，经常因为帮助当地农民驯马而受伤。他还组织了加拿大第一支牛仔竞技表演队。在一张全家福中，约书亚穿着挂满饰物的服饰，表演牛仔甩绳套的技能。十几岁的时候，约书亚来到艾奥瓦州，并在那里的帕尔默按摩学校<sup>(Palmer School of Chiropractic)</sup>获得了一个学位，然后又回到萨斯喀彻温省当了一个农夫。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When the depression hit in the 1930s, Haldeman fell into a financial crisis. He could not afford to keep up with bank loans on his equipment and had five thousand acres of land seized. “From then on, Dad didn't believe in banks or holding on to money,” said Scott Haldeman, who would go on to receive his chiropractic degree from the same school as his father and become one of the world's top spinal pain experts. After losing the farm around 1934, Haldeman lived something of a nomadic existence that his grandson would replicate in Canada decades later. Standing six feet, three inches, he did odd jobs as a construction worker and rodeo performer before settling down as a chiropractor.*</p><p>在经济大衰退袭来的20世纪30年代，约书亚陷入了金融危机。他无法偿还用来购买设备的银行贷款，导致5000亩土地被查封。“从那时起，父亲不再相信银行，并且不再存钱。”斯科特·霍尔德曼说。他后来获得了和父亲同一所按摩学校的按摩师学位，并成为世界顶尖的脊柱病治疗专家。1934年，失去农场的约书亚开始四处漂泊，而几十年后自己的孙子也重复着这种生活。斯科特身高6英尺3英寸<sup>(约1.9米)</sup>，在成为一名按摩师之前，做过诸如建筑工人和牛仔竞技表演者等各种工作。<sup>[2]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>By 1948, Haldeman had married a Canadian dance studio instructor, Winnifred Josephine Fletcher, or Wyn, and built a booming chiropractic practice. That year, the family, which already included a son and a daughter, welcomed twin daughters Kaye and Maye, Musk's mother. The children lived in a three-story, twenty-room house that included a dance studio to let Wyn keep teaching students. Ever in search of something new to do, Haldeman had picked up flying and bought his own plane. The family gained some measure of notoriety as people heard about Haldeman and his wife packing their kids into the back of the single-engine craft and heading off on excursions all around North America. </p><p>1948年，约书亚娶了一位加拿大舞蹈老师温妮弗雷德·约瑟芬·弗莱彻<sup>(温)</sup>，并成立了一家欣欣向荣的按摩诊所。那一年，在有了一对儿女之后，他们又迎来了双胞胎女儿卡耶和梅耶——也就是马斯克的母亲。孩子们住在一幢三层楼高，有20个房间的大房子里，里面还有一个舞蹈教室，温可以在那里继续教舞蹈。约书亚不断尝试新的事情，开始学习驾驶飞机并购买了私人飞机。据说约书亚和妻子把孩子放在那架单引擎飞机的后座上，带着他们在北美洲大陆四处游历。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Haldeman would often show up at political and chiropractic meetings in the plane and later wrote a book with his wife called The Flying Haldemans: Pity the Poor Private Pilot.</p><p>约书亚会经常驾驶飞机出席各种政治活动或者与按摩相关的会议，后来还和妻子合写了一本书，名为“飞行的霍尔德曼家族：可怜一下这个穷苦的飞行员吧”<sup>(The Flying Haldemans: Pity the Poor Private Pilot)</sup>。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Haldeman seemed to have everything going for him when, in 1950, he decided to give it all away. The doctor-cum-politician had long railed against government interference in the lives of individuals and had come to see the Canadian bureaucracy as too meddlesome. A man who forbade swearing, smoking, Coca-Cola, and refined flour at his house, Haldeman contended that the moral character of Canada had started to decline. Haldeman also possessed an enduring lust for adventure. And so, over the course of a few months, the family sold their house and dance and chiropractic practices and decided to move to South Africa—a place Haldeman had never been. Scott Haldeman remembers helping his father disassemble the family's Bellanca Cruisair (1948) airplane and put it into crates before shipping it to Africa. Once in South Africa, the family rebuilt the plane and used it to scour the country for a nice place to live, ultimately settling on Pretoria, where Haldeman set up a new chiropractic practice.</p><p>1950年，当约书亚似乎已经拥有一切的时候，他却决定放弃一切，准备重新开始。这个医生兼政治评论家长期抨击加拿大政府作风官僚，爱管闲事，干扰个人生活。作为一个在家里禁止说脏话、吸烟，不许喝可口可乐，不许食用精制面粉的男人，约书亚认为加拿大的道德已经开始堕落。此外，他还有蠢蠢欲动的冒险渴望。于是几个月之内，一家人卖掉了他们的大房子、舞蹈教室和按摩诊所，决定搬往南非——一个斯科特从来没有去过的地方。斯科特·霍尔德曼还记得，他曾帮助父亲拆解了一架1948年制造的贝兰卡<sup>(Bellanca Cruisaire)</sup>飞机，并打包装进木箱里，然后运往南非。到了南非之后，他们重新组装好飞机，然后驾驶飞机横穿整个国家，去寻找适合居住的地方。最后，一家人终于在比勒陀利亚定居下来，并重新开了一家按摩诊所。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The family's spirit for adventure seemed to know no bounds. In 1952, Joshua and Wyn made a 22,000-mile round-trip journey in their plane, flying up through Africa to Scotland and Norway. Wyn served as the navigator and, though not a licensed pilot, would sometimes take over the flying duties. The couple topped this effort in 1954, flying 30,000 miles to Australia and back.</p><p>这个家庭的冒险精神似乎是无穷无尽的。1952年，约书亚和温驾驶飞机完成了一次2.2万英里的往返旅行，从非洲北上一直飞到苏格兰和挪威。温没有飞机驾驶执照，她大部分时候担任领航员，但有时候也会自己驾驶。1954年，这对夫妻的驾驶事业达到顶峰，他们飞行3万英里往返于澳大利亚。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p> Newspapers reported on the couple's trip, and they're believed to be the only private pilots to get from Africa to Australia in a single-engine plane.*</p><p>报纸报道了这次飞行旅途，他们被认为是唯一驾驶单引擎飞机从非洲飞到澳大利亚的私人飞行员。<sup>[3]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When not up in the air, the Haldemans were out in the bush going on great, monthlong expeditions to find the Lost City of the Kalahari Desert, a supposed abandoned city in southern Africa. A family photo from one of these excursions shows the five children in the middle of the African bush. They have gathered around a large metal pot being warmed by the embers of a campfire. The children look relaxed as they sit in folding chairs, legs crossed and reading books. Behind them is the ruby-red Bellanca plane, a tent, and a car. The tranquility of the scene belies how dangerous these trips were. During one incident, the family's truck hit a tree stump and forced the bumper through the radiator. Stuck in the middle of nowhere with no means of communication, Joshua worked for three days to fix the truck, while the family hunted for food. At other times, hyenas and leopards would circle the campfire at night, and, one morning, the family woke to find a lion three feet away from their main table. Joshua grabbed the first object he could find—a lamp—waved it, and told the lion to go away. And it did.*</p><p>除了飞行，霍尔德曼和家人还曾经深入丛林，用了一个月的时间去寻找失落之城。传说中这座古城位于南部非洲的喀拉哈里沙漠<sup>(Kalaha Desert)</sup>。一张全家福展现了当时的情景。在非洲丛林里，5个孩子围绕在一堆篝火旁，篝火上面是一口被加热了的大锅。孩子们看起来很放松，他们交叉着双腿坐在折椅上看书，身后有一架宝石红贝兰卡飞机、一顶帐篷和一辆汽车。但画面中的宁静掩盖了这次旅程的凶险。在一次事故中，他们的卡车撞上了一个树桩，导致保险杆穿透了散热器。他们于是被困在这片没有通信设施的蛮荒之地，约书亚花了3天时间才修好车，而其他人则到处猎食。夜晚的时候，土狼和豹子会在篝火周围徘徊。一天早晨，一家人醒来发现一头狮子就站在离桌子3英尺远的地方。约书亚马上抓住他能找到的第一件物品——一盏灯，朝狮子挥舞着，并叫狮子滚开，没想到狮子还真的逃走了。<sup>[4]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Haldemans had a laissez-faire approach to raising their children, which would extend over the generations to Musk. Their kids were never punished, as Joshua believed they would intuit their way to proper behavior. When mom and dad went off on their tremendous flights, the kids were left at home. Scott Haldeman can't remember his father setting foot at his school a single time even though his son was captain of the rugby team and a prefect. “To him, that was all just anticipated,” said Scott Haldeman. “We were left with the impression that we were capable of anything. You just have to make a decision and do it. In that sense, my father would be very proud of Elon.”</p><p>霍尔德曼夫妇采用放任自流的方式来抚养孩子，这种方式也沿用到几代之后的马斯克身上。孩子们从来没有受过体罚，因为约书亚认为直觉会引导他们做出正确的行为。当父母都去飞行的时候，孩子们则留在家里。斯科特·霍尔德曼记得父亲从未踏足过他的学校，即使他是学校橄榄球队的队长和完美的孩子。“对于他来说，这些都是预料之中的事情，”斯科特·霍尔德曼说，“他教导我们说，你能够做成任何事情，你只需要做出决定，然后放手去做。在这个意义上来说，我的父亲肯定会为埃隆感到自豪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Haldeman died in 1974 at the age of seventy-two. He'd been doing practice landings in his plane and didn't see a wire attached to a pair of poles. The wire caught the plane's wheels and flipped the craft, and Haldeman broke his neck. Elon was a toddler at the time. But throughout his childhood, Elon heard many stories about his grandfather's exploits and sat through countless slide shows that documented his travels and trips through the bush. “My grandmother told these tales of how they almost died several times along their journeys,” Musk said. “They were flying in a plane with literally no instruments—not even a radio, and they had road maps instead of aerial maps, and some of those weren't even correct. My grandfather had this desire for adventure, exploration doing crazy things.” Elon buys into the idea that his unusual tolerance for risk may well have been inherited directly from his grandfather. Many years after the last slide show, Elon tried to find and purchase the red Bellanca plane but could not locate it.</p><p>约书亚于1974年离世，享年72岁。当时他正驾驶飞机练习着陆，但没有看见两根电线杆中间有一根电线，那根电线缠住了飞机轮子并把飞机掀翻，霍尔德曼折断了脖子不幸身亡。埃隆当时还在蹒跚学步，但他在童年时代，听说过自己外祖父的许多英勇事迹，并观看了数不清的关于丛林旅行的幻灯片资料。“我的外祖母给我讲了很多在旅途中九死一生的经历，”马斯克说，“他们的飞机上没有装备任何仪器——连无线电都没有，他们用公路地图代替航空地图，这些地图上甚至有很多错误。我的外祖父对冒险和探索的热爱几近疯狂。”埃隆坦承，他非同寻常的冒险性格直接来源于他的外祖父。在最后一次播放幻灯片多年以后，埃隆试图寻找并买回那架红色的贝兰卡飞机，但未能如愿。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Maye Musk, Elon's mother, grew up idolizing her parents. In her youth, she was considered a nerd. She liked math and science and did well at the coursework. By the age of fifteen, however, people had taken notice of some of her other attributes. Maye was gorgeous. Tall with ash-blond hair, Maye had the high cheekbones and angular features that would make her stand out anywhere. A friend of the family ran a modeling school, and Maye took some courses. On the weekends, she did runway shows, magazine shoots, occasionally showed up at a senator's or ambassador's home for an event, and ended up as a finalist for Miss South Africa. </p><p>埃隆的妈妈梅耶·马斯克在对父母的崇拜之中长大。在青少年时期，她被认为是一个书呆子。她喜欢数学和科学，学习成绩很好。但到了15岁的时候，梅耶变得亭亭玉立，人们开始注意到她的其他特点。高挑瘦削的身材配上金色的头发，还有高高的颧骨，让她从众人里面脱颖而出。她家的一个朋友经营着一所模特学校，梅耶到那里上过一些课程。到了周末，她便四处走秀、给杂志做模特，偶尔会参加为参议员或大使举办的宴会，最后她还入围了南非小姐评选大赛的决赛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>(Maye has continued to model into her sixties, appearing on the covers of magazines like New York and Elle and in Beyoncé's music videos.)</p><p>梅耶在60多岁时还在继续从事她的模特事业，登上了时尚杂志《纽约客》<sup>(The New Yorker)</sup>和《世界时装之苑》<sup>(ELLE)</sup>的封面，并出演了歌手碧昂斯的音乐短片。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Maye and Elon's father, Errol Musk, grew up in the same neighborhood. They met for the first time when Maye, born in 1948, was about eleven. Errol was the cool kid to Maye's nerd but had a crush on her for years. “He fell in love with me because of my legs and my teeth,” said Maye. </p><p>梅耶和埃隆的父亲埃罗尔·马斯克在同一个街区长大。他们第一次见面的时候，梅耶11岁。埃罗尔是一个潮男，而梅耶却是一个书呆子，但埃罗尔却暗恋了梅耶很多年。“他因为我的腿、我的牙齿而爱上了我。”梅耶说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The two would date on and off throughout their time at university. And, according to Maye, Errol spent about seven years as a relentless suitor seeking her hand in marriage and eventually breaking her will. “He just never stopped proposing,” she said.</p><p>两人在大学期间分分合合。据梅耶回忆，埃罗尔花了大约7年时间不懈地追求她，并最终打动了她。“他从来没有停止过求婚。”她说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Their marriage was complicated from the start. Maye became pregnant during the couple's honeymoon and gave birth to Elon on June 28, 1971, nine months and two days after her wedding day. While they may not have enjoyed marital bliss, the couple carved out a decent life for themselves in Pretoria. Errol worked as a mechanical and electrical engineer and handled large projects such as office buildings, retail complexes, residential subdivisions, and an air force base, while Maye set up a practice as a dietician. A bit more than a year after Elon's birth came his brother Kimbal, and soon thereafter came their sister Tosca.</p><p>他们的婚姻从一开始就错综复杂。梅耶在蜜月期怀孕并于1971年6月28日生下了埃隆，距离他们的结婚日仅九个月零两天。尽管他们没有享受到太多婚姻带来的幸福，但夫妻俩努力在比勒陀利亚过着体面的生活。埃罗尔是一名机械和电气工程师，负责处理一些大型项目，如办公楼、商场、住宅楼和空军基地等，而梅耶是一个营养师。埃隆出生一年多后，弟弟金巴尔出生了，不久，妹妹托斯卡也出生了。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Elon exhibited all the traits of a curious, energetic tot. He picked things up easily, and Maye, like many mothers do, pegged her son as brilliant and precocious. “He seemed to understand things quicker than the other kids,” she said. The perplexing thing was that Elon seemed to drift off into a trance at times. People spoke to him, but nothing got through when he had a certain, distant look in his eyes. This happened so often that Elon's parents and doctors thought he might be deaf. “Sometimes, he just didn't hear you,” said Maye. Doctors ran a series of tests on Elon, and elected to remove his adenoid glands, which can improve hearing in children. “Well, it didn't change,” said Maye. Elon's condition had far more to do with the wiring of his mind than how his auditory system functioned. “He goes into his brain, and then you just see he is in another world,” Maye said. “He still does that. Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something.”</p><p>埃隆展现出一个充满好奇和活力的孩子的所有特征。他学东西总是很快。梅耶像很多其他母亲那样，断定她的儿子聪明且早熟。“他理解事物的速度似乎比其他孩子更快。”她说。但是令人困惑的是，埃隆总是陷入发呆的状态。当人们跟他说话时，他经常没有反应，眼睛呆滞地望着远处。这样的事情频繁发生，令埃隆的父母和医生以为他耳聋。“有时候，他就是听不见你说话。”梅耶说。医生给埃隆做了一系列测试，并摘除了他的扁桃体，因为这样可以增强听力。“但这并不管用。”梅耶说。埃隆的状况其实更像是他的思想而不是听力系统的问题。“他总是在思考，然后就进入了另一个世界，”梅耶说，“他现在仍然是这样，我只能随他这样，因为我知道他正在设计新式火箭之类的东西。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Other children did not respond well to these dreamlike states. You could do jumping jacks right beside Musk or yell at him, and he would not even notice. He kept right on thinking, and those around him judged that he was either rude or really weird. “I do think Elon was always a little different but in a nerdy way,” Maye said. “It didn't endear him to his peers.”</p><p>其他孩子对马斯克的这种梦游状态表现得并不那么友好。他们会在马斯克身旁突然跳起来或者大喊大叫，但他却总是置若罔闻。他总是保持着思考状态，而他周围的人觉得他这种行为很粗鲁或者古怪。“我确实认为埃隆与众不同，但只是书呆子气重些，”梅耶说，“这让他的同龄人很不喜欢他。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For Musk, these pensive moments were wonderful. At five and six, he had found a way to block out the world and dedicate all of his concentration to a single task. Part of this ability stemmed from the very visual way in which Musk's mind worked. He could see images in his mind's eye with a clarity and detail that we might associate today with an engineering drawing produced by computer software. “It seems as though the part of the brain that's usually reserved for visual processing—the part that is used to process images coming in from my eyes—gets taken over by internal thought processes,” Musk said. “I can't do this as much now because there are so many things demanding my attention but, as a kid, it happened a lot. That large part of your brain that's used to handle incoming images gets used for internal thinking.” Computers split their hardest jobs between two types of chips. There are graphics chips that deal with processing the images produced by a television show stream or video game and computational chips that handle general purpose tasks and mathematical operations. Over time, Musk has ended up thinking that his brain has the equivalent of a graphics chip. It allows him to see things out in the world, replicate them in his mind, and imagine how they might change or behave when interacting with other objects. “For images and numbers, I can process their interrelationships and algorithmic relationships,” Musk said. “Acceleration, momentum, kinetic energy—how those sorts of things will be affected by objects comes through very vividly.”</p><p>对于马斯克来说，这种状态却让他受益匪浅。在五六岁的时候，他就找到了一种抵挡外界干扰的方法，让他可以集中精力在一项任务上。这种能力部分源于他的思维方式。他在大脑中呈现的图像清晰且具体，就像是今天计算机软件制作的工程图纸。“就好像大脑中专门用于视觉处理的那部分——本来应该处理眼睛接收的图像，却被内部思维占据了，”马斯克说，“我现在无法做到这样了，因为有太多事情分散了我的注意力，但是在我的孩提时代，它却总能发生。你用来处理视觉信息的很大一部分大脑，被内部想法占据了。”计算机将最困难的工作交给两种不同芯片。图形芯片处理来自电视或者视频游戏的任务，而计算芯片处理一般任务和数学运算。随着时间的推移，马斯克认定自己的大脑就相当于一块图形芯片。这让他能看见世界之外的东西，并复制到他的脑海里，想象它们与其他对象交互时，会发生什么变化。“对于图像和数字，我可以在大脑中处理它们之间的相互关系并进行演算，”马斯克说，“比如加速、动量、动能为何因物体而异，这些总会以生动的方式呈现在我的脑海里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The most striking part of Elon's character as a young boy was his compulsion to read. From a very young age, he seemed to have a book in his hands at all times. “It was not unusual for him to read ten hours a day,” said Kimbal. “If it was the weekend, he could go through two books in a day.” The family went on numerous shopping excursions in which they realized mid-trip that Elon had gone missing. Maye or Kimbal would pop into the nearest bookstore and find Elon somewhere near the back sitting on the floor and reading in one of his trancelike states.</p><p>作为一个小男孩儿，埃隆性格中最引人注目的部分，是他对读书如饥似渴。从很小的时候开始，他似乎就书不离手。“他每天读书10个小时是家常便饭，”金巴尔说，“如果是周末，他可以一天读完两本书。”全家人去购物的时候，经常发现埃隆中途不见了，梅耶和金巴尔就跑到最近的书店去找，总能看见埃隆坐在地板上全神贯注地看书。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As Elon got older, he would take himself to the bookstore when school ended at 2 P.M. and stay there until about 6 P.M., when his parents returned home from work. He plowed through fiction books and then comics and then nonfiction titles. “Sometimes they kicked me out of the store, but usually not,” Elon said. He listed The Lord of the Rings, Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, and Robert Heinlein's The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress as some of his favorites, alongside The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. “At one point, I ran out of books to read at the school library and the neighborhood library,” Musk said. “This is maybe the third or fourth grade. I tried to convince the librarian to order books for me. So then, I started to read the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That was so helpful. You don't know what you don't know. You realize there are all these things out there.”</p><p>随着年龄的增长，埃隆会在下午2点放学以后自己跑到书店去，一直待到下午6点父母下班回家。他喜欢翻阅小说和漫画，后来也看非小说类书籍。“有时候他们会把我赶出来，但通常不会赶我，”埃隆说。他列举了《魔戒》、艾萨克·阿西莫夫的“基地”系列和罗伯特·海因莱因的《严厉的月之女王》<sup>(The Moon is a Harsh Mistress)</sup>，这些是他的最爱，当然还有《银河系漫游指南》。“有一次，我把学校以及邻近图书馆的书都看完了，”马斯克说，“大概是在三年级或四年级的时候。我试图劝说图书馆员帮我订更多的书。之后，我就开始阅读《大英百科全书》，这让我受益匪浅，我发现自己不知道的东西太多了，而所有的一切都在书里。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Elon, in fact, churned through two sets of encyclopedias—a feat that did little to help him make friends. The boy had a photographic memory, and the encyclopedias turned him into a fact factory. He came off as a classic know-it-all. At the dinner table, Tosca would wonder aloud about the distance from Earth to the Moon. Elon would spit out the exact measurement at perigee and apogee. “If we had a question, Tosca would always say, ‘Just ask genius boy,'” Maye said. “We could ask him about anything. He just remembered it.” Elon cemented his bookworm reputation through his clumsy ways. “He's not very sporty,” said Maye.</p><p>埃隆实际上已经将两套百科全书读得烂熟于心了——这对他交朋友一点帮助都没有。这个男孩儿有着过目不忘的记忆力，而百科全书把他变成了一个事实工厂。他总是表现出无所不知的样子。比如在饭桌上，托斯卡很想知道地球到月球的距离，而埃隆可以脱口而出近地点和远地点的精确数字。“如果我们有什么问题，托斯卡总是说，‘问那个天才少年’，”梅耶说，“不管我们问他什么，他都记得。”埃隆用这种笨拙的方式巩固了他书呆子的声誉。“他不是很爱运动。”梅耶说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Maye tells the story of Elon playing outside one night with his siblings and cousins. When one of them complained of being frightened by the dark, Elon pointed out that “dark is merely the absence of light,” which did little to reassure the scared child. As a youngster, Elon's constant yearning to correct people and his abrasive manner put off other kids and added to his feelings of isolation. Elon genuinely thought that people would be happy to hear about the flaws in their thinking. “Kids don't like answers like that,” said Maye. “They would say, ‘Elon, we are not playing with you anymore.' I felt very sad as a mother because I think he wanted friends. Kimbal and Tosca would bring home friends, and Elon wouldn't, and he would want to play with them. But he was awkward, you know.” Maye urged Kimbal and Tosca to include Elon. They responded as kids will. “But Mom, he's not fun.” As he got older, however, Elon would have strong, affectionate attachments to his siblings and cousins—his mother's sister's sons. Though he kept to himself at school, Elon had an outgoing nature with members of his family and eventually took on the role of elder and chief instigator among them.</p><p>梅耶回忆起一件往事：一天晚上，埃隆正和一大群孩子玩耍。当其中一个人抱怨害怕黑暗时，埃隆却说“黑暗只是没有光线而已”，这显然无法安抚那个吓坏了的孩子。作为一个年轻人，埃隆这种爱纠正别人的学究气，以及他生硬粗暴的做法，让其他孩子渐渐疏远他。这让他感到愈加孤独，但埃隆却以为，人们会乐意听到错误被纠正。“孩子们其实不喜欢这样，”梅耶说，“他们都说，‘埃隆，我们不跟你玩了。’作为一个母亲，我感到很难过，因为我觉得他需要朋友。金巴尔和托斯卡会带朋友回家，但埃隆从来不会，但是他愿意跟他们一起玩。可他总是很别扭，你知道的。”梅耶总是敦促金巴尔和托斯卡带上埃隆一起玩，他们的反应很孩子气：“妈妈，他很无趣。”可是当他长大之后，埃隆却对自己的兄弟和表兄弟——梅耶妹妹的儿子们，有着很深的感情。虽然他在学校里总是独处，但埃隆跟家族成员在一起时却很活跃，并逐渐承担起家族长者和领袖的角色。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For a while, life inside the Musk household was quite good. The family owned one of the biggest houses in Pretoria thanks to the success of Errol's engineering business. There's a portrait of the three Musk children taken when Elon was about eight years old that shows three blond, fit children sitting next to each other on a brick porch with Pretoria's famous purple jacaranda trees in the background. Elon has large, rounded cheeks and a broad smile.</p><p>有一段时间，马斯克一家的生活还是很不错的。他们住在比勒陀利亚最大的一所房子里，这要归功于埃罗尔出色的工程生意。8岁的时候，埃隆和弟弟妹妹们拍过一张合影，照片中三个活泼健康的金发孩子在门廊上坐成一排，后院是比勒陀利亚著名的紫楹树。埃隆圆润的脸颊上露出明朗的笑容。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Then, not long after the photo was taken, the family fell apart. His parents separated and divorced within the year. Maye moved with the kids to the family's holiday home in Durban, on South Africa's eastern coast. After a couple of years of this arrangement, Elon decided he wanted to live with his father. “My father seemed sort of sad and lonely, and my mom had three kids, and he didn't have any,” Musk said. “It seemed unfair.” Some members of Musk's family have bought into this idea that Elon's logical nature propelled him, while others claim that his father's mother, Cora, exerted a lot of pressure on the boy. “I could not understand why he would leave this happy home I made for him—this really happy home,” said Maye. “But Elon is his own person.” Justine Musk, Elon's ex-wife and the mother of his five boys, theorized that Elon identified more with the alpha male of the house and wasn't bothered by the emotional aspect of the decision. “I don't think he was particularly close with either parent,” Justine said, while describing the Musk clan overall as being cool and the opposite of doting. Kimbal later opted to live with Errol as well, saying simply that by nature a son wants to live with his father.</p><p>但是，这张照片拍完没有多久，这个家庭就崩溃了。他的父母分居并在一年内离婚。梅耶带着孩子搬到了南非东海岸的德班<sup>(Durban)</sup>，在家族成员度假时居住的房子里生活。但是几年之后，埃隆决定和父亲一起生活。“我父亲似乎很难过，并且很孤独，母亲带着三个孩子，而他却什么都没有，”马斯克说，“这不公平。”实际上，一些马斯克的家庭成员认为，是埃隆的逻辑天性驱使他这么做，然而有人则声称是他的祖母科拉给他施加了压力。“我不明白他为什么离开我为他营造的这个幸福的家，这的的确确是一个幸福的家，”梅耶说，“但埃隆是一个有主见的人。”贾斯汀·马斯克<sup>(Justine Musk)</sup>是埃隆的前妻，他5个孩子的妈妈，她认为埃隆一直是一家之主，而且做决定的时候从来不受情绪困扰。贾斯汀说，“我认为他和父母中的任何一方都不亲近。”据她描述，马斯克家族成员之间关系冷漠且缺少关爱。但金巴尔后来也选择与埃罗尔一起生活。也许儿子愿意与父亲一起生活是天性使然。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Whenever the topic of Errol arrives, members of Elon's family clam up. They're in agreement that he is not a pleasant man to be around but have declined to elaborate. Errol has since been remarried, and Elon has two, younger half sisters of whom he's quite protective. </p><p>每当说到埃罗尔的时候，埃隆的家人总是保持沉默。他们承认他是一个不好相处的人，但拒绝透露细节。埃罗尔之后再婚，并为埃隆生下两个同父异母的妹妹。马斯克对她们颇为照顾。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Elon and his siblings seem determined not to bad-mouth Errol publicly, so as not to upset the sisters.</p><p>埃隆和他的弟弟之所以决定对埃罗尔不好的方面守口如瓶，是不希望这两个妹妹难过。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The basics are as follows: Errol's side of the family has deep South African roots. The Musk clan can trace its presence in the country back about two hundred years and claim an entry in Pretoria's first phone book. Errol's father, Walter Henry James Musk, was an army sergeant. “I remember him almost never talking,” Elon said. “He would just drink whiskey and be grumpy and was very good at doing crossword puzzles.” Cora Amelia Musk, Errol's mother, was born in England to a family famed for its intellectual genes. She embraced both the spotlight and her grandchildren. “Our grandmother had this very dominant personality and was quite an enterprising woman,” said Kimbal. “She was a very big influence in our lives.” Elon considered his relationship with Cora—or Nana, as he called her—particularly tight. “After the divorce, she took care of me quite a lot,” he said. “She would pick me up from school, and I would hang out with her playing Scrabble and that type of thing.”</p><p>埃罗尔家的情况是这样的：埃罗尔家在南非有着很深的根基。马斯克家族在南非的历史可以一直追溯到200年前，比勒陀利亚的第一本电话簿上就有他们家庭成员的名字。埃罗尔的父亲瓦尔特·亨利·詹姆斯·马斯克是一个陆军中士。“在我的记忆中，他沉默寡言，”埃隆说，“他爱喝威士忌，而且脾气暴躁，但很擅长填字游戏。”埃罗尔的母亲科拉·阿米莉亚·马斯克出生在英格兰一个知识分子家庭。她喜欢受人瞩目，并爱着她的孙子们。“我们的祖母很强势，是一个相当努力的女人，”金巴尔说，“她对我们的人生产生了很大的影响。”埃隆认为他和科拉——自己祖母的关系非常亲密。“父母离婚后，她给了我无微不至的照顾，”他说，“她会接我放学，还会和我一起做玩拼字游戏之类的事情。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>On the surface, life at Errol's house seemed grand. He had plenty of books for Elon to read from cover to cover and money to buy a computer and other objects that Elon desired. Errol took his children on numerous trips overseas. “It was an amazingly fun time,” said Kimbal. </p><p>埃罗尔家的生活看上去很美。他有大量的书籍可供埃隆阅读，还愿意在计算机和其他一些埃隆喜欢的事情上花钱。埃罗尔还无数次带孩子们到海外旅行。“那是一段难忘且充满乐趣的时光。”金巴尔说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“I have a lot of fun memories from that.” Errol also impressed the kids with his intellect and dealt out some practical lessons. “He was a talented engineer,” Elon said. “He knew how every physical object worked.” Both Elon and Kimbal were required to go to the sites of Errol's engineering jobs and learn how to lay bricks, install plumbing, fit windows, and put in electrical wiring. “There were fun moments,” Elon said.</p><p>“在那里，我有很多快乐美好的回忆。”他的智慧和实践经验给孩子们留下了深刻的印象。“他是一个天才工程师，”埃隆说，“他知道每一种物理现象背后的原理。”埃罗尔经常带埃隆和金巴尔到建筑工地，学习如何铺砖，安装管道、窗户和电线。“这些都是很愉快的时光。”埃隆说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Errol was what Kimbal described as “ultra-present and very intense.” He would sit Elon and Kimbal down and lecture at them for three to four hours without the boys being able to respond. He seemed to delight in being hard on the boys and sucked the fun out of common childhood diversions. From time to time, Elon tried to convince his dad to move to America and often talked about his intentions to live in the United States later in life. Errol countered such dreams by trying to teach Elon a lesson. He sent the housekeepers away and had Elon do all the chores to let him know what it was like “to play American.”</p><p>在金巴尔看来，埃罗尔具有远眼卓识，并且十分严厉。他会让埃隆和金巴尔坐下来，连续教导他们三四个小时，让男孩儿们无力反驳。他似乎更倾向于对孩子们严加管束并以此为乐，而他这么做显然也剥夺了他们孩童时代的乐趣。埃隆曾多次试图说服父亲搬到美国，并经常谈论自己想去美国定居的想法。埃罗尔好好教训了他一顿，驳斥了他不切实际的想法。父亲打发走了管家，让埃隆把所有家务活儿做完，让他明白这才是“美国人”的生活。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While Elon and Kimbal declined to provide an exact recounting, they clearly experienced something awful and profound during those years with their father. They both talk about having to endure some form of psychological torture. “He definitely has serious chemical stuff,” said Kimbal. “Which I am sure Elon and I have inherited. It was a very emotionally challenging upbringing, but it made us who we are today.” Maye bristled when the subject of Errol came up. </p><p>虽然埃隆和金巴尔都拒绝透露更多细节，但这些年与父亲共同生活的经历无疑是刻骨铭心的。他们都谈到需要忍受某种形式的精神折磨。“他的体内肯定具有某种重要的化学物质，”金巴尔说，“并且肯定都遗传给我和埃隆了。这令我们的成长过程在情绪方面极具挑战性，但也造就了今天的我们。”而当被问到关于埃罗尔的话题时，梅耶总是怒从中来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“Nobody gets along with him,” she said. “He is not nice to anyone. I don't want to tell stories because they are horrendous. You know, you just don't talk about it. There are kids and grandkids involved.”</p><p>“没有人能跟他和睦相处，”她说，“他对任何人都不友好。我不想说谎，因为那太可怕了。我不想谈论这些，因为这会影响到我的孩子和孙子们。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When asked to chat about Elon, Errol responded via e-mail: “Elon was a very independent and focused child at home with me. He loved computer science before anyone even knew what it was in South Africa and his ability was widely recognized by the time he was 12 years old. Elon and his brother Kimbal's activities as children and young men were so many and varied that it's difficult to name just one, as they travelled together with me extensively in S. Africa and the world at large, visiting all the continents regularly from the age of six onwards. Elon and his brother and sister were and continue to be exemplary, in every way a father could want. I'm very proud of what Elon's accomplished.”</p><p>当我们请他聊聊有关埃隆的事情时，埃罗尔通过电子邮件回复道：“埃隆在家的时候是一个独立且专注的孩子。甚至在南非还没有人知道计算机为何物时，他就已经迷上了计算机科学。12岁的时候，他的能力就得到了广泛认可。在童年和青少年时期，埃隆和弟弟金巴尔的行为多种多样，一言难尽。从6岁开始，他们就和我游历了南非和全世界，走遍了五大洲。埃隆和他的弟弟妹妹各个方面都无可挑剔，实现了为人父者对孩子的所有期许。我对埃隆取得的成就感到非常自豪。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Errol copied Elon on this e-mail, and Elon warned me off corresponding with his father, insisting that his father's take on past events could not be trusted. “He is an odd duck,” Musk said. But, when pressed for more information, Musk dodged. “It would certainly be accurate to say that I did not have a good childhood,” he said. “It may sound good. It was not absent of good, but it was not a happy childhood. It was like misery. He's good at making life miserable—that's for sure. He can take any situation no matter how good it is and make it bad. He's not a happy man. I don't know . . . fuck . . . I don't know how someone becomes like he is. It would just cause too much trouble to tell you any more.” Elon and Justine have vowed that their children will not be allowed to meet Errol.</p><p>埃罗尔把电子邮件抄送给了埃隆。埃隆警告我不要再联络他父亲，并坚称他父亲对于过往的回忆不足为信。“他是一个怪人，”马斯克说，“一个十足的疯子。”但是当我想了解更多细节时，马斯克却刻意回避。“准确地说，我没有一个幸福的童年。”他说：“我的童年时期可能听起来很不错，其中当然也有好的方面，但绝对不是一个快乐的童年。实际上，我的童年生活很悲惨。他总是把生活搞得一塌糊涂——这一点我非常肯定。无论多好的情况，都会被他变得很糟糕。他不是一个快乐的人。我不知道。我不知道一个人怎么会变成这样。我再说下去就会惹麻烦了。”埃隆和贾斯汀发誓，绝不允许他的孩子们和埃罗尔见面。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>When Elon was nearly ten years old, he saw a computer for the first time, at the Sandton City Mall in Johannesburg. “There was an electronics store that mostly did hi-fi-type stuff, but then, in one corner, they started stocking a few computers,” Musk said. He felt awed right away—“It was like, ‘Whoa. Holy shit!'”—by this machine that could be programmed to do a person's bidding. “I had to have that and then hounded my father to get the computer,” Musk said. Soon he owned a Commodore VIC-20, a popular home machine that went on sale in 1980. Elon's computer arrived with five kilobytes of memory and a workbook on the BASIC programming language. “It was supposed to take like six months to get through all the lessons,” Elon said. “I just got super OCD on it and stayed up for three days with no sleep and did the entire thing. It seemed like the most super-compelling thing I had ever seen.” Despite being an engineer, Musk's father was something of a Luddite and dismissive of the machine. Elon recounted that “he said it was just for games and that you'd never be able to do real engineering on it. I just said, ‘Whatever.'”</p><p>当埃隆快10岁的时候，他在约翰内斯堡的桑顿城购物中心第一次看到了计算机。“那里有一家电子产品商店，销售诸如音响器材之类的设备，但是他们在一个角落摆放了几台计算机。”马斯克说。他立刻产生了敬畏之心——“这就像是‘哇，我的天啊’”——他可以用这台机器编程来执行人类的指令。“我必须得到它，所以我缠着父亲去买计算机。”马斯克说。很快，他便拥有了一台Commodo VIC-20型计算机。这款畅销的家用计算机于1980年面世，有着5KB<sup>(5000比特)</sup>的内存，并随机附送了一本BASIC汇编语言教学手册。“本来需要6个月的时间才能学完所有课程，”埃隆说，“但是我像得了强迫症似的，一连看了三天三夜没有睡觉，把所有的内容都读完了。这像是我遇到过的最紧迫的事情。”尽管马斯克的父亲是一名工程师，但他有点守旧，对这台机器嗤之以鼻。埃隆回忆说：“他说这只能用来玩游戏，不能用于真正的工程项目。而我只是说‘无所谓’。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While bookish and into his new computer, Elon quite often led Kimbal and his cousins (Kaye's children) Russ, Lyndon, and Peter Rive on adventures. They dabbled one year in selling Easter eggs door-to-door in the neighborhood. The eggs were not well decorated, but the boys still marked them up a few hundred percent for their wealthy neighbors. Elon also spearheaded their work with homemade explosives and rockets. South Africa did not have the Estes rocket kits popular among hobbyists, so Elon would create his own chemical compounds and put them inside of canisters. “It is remarkable how many things you can get to explode,” Elon said. “Saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal are the basic ingredients for gunpowder, and then if you combine a strong acid with a strong alkaline, that will generally release a lot of energy. Granulated chlorine with brake fluid—that's quite impressive. I'm lucky I have all my fingers.” When not handling explosives, the boys put on layers of clothing and goggles and shot each other with pellet guns. Elon and Kimbal raced dirt bikes against each other in sandlots until Kimbal flew off his bike one day and hurtled into a barbed wire fence.</p><p>尽管迷恋新计算机并且是个书呆子，但埃隆经常领着金巴尔和他的表兄弟<sup>(卡耶的孩子)</sup>罗斯·里沃、林登·里沃还有彼得·里沃去冒险。有一年，他们去邻居家挨家挨户地卖复活节彩蛋。尽管彩蛋装饰得并不漂亮，但孩子们为了将彩蛋卖给他们富裕的邻居，硬是将售价提高了几倍。埃隆还组织大家在家自制炸药和火箭。南非并没有深受业余爱好者喜欢的火箭套装，埃隆就自制化合物，并把它们装进罐子里。“值得一提的是，有很多东西可以用来引爆，”埃隆说，“硝石、硫黄和木炭是火药的基本成分，然后把强酸和强碱混合在一起，就会释放出巨大的能量。如果再加上氯粒和制动液——产生的爆破效果可是相当可观的。我很幸运，我的10个手指头都还在。”不玩炸药的时候，男孩儿们会穿上好几层衣服并戴上护目镜，用弹球枪互相射击。埃隆和金巴尔还在沙地里举行骑自行车比赛，直到金巴尔有一次从车子上摔下来，径直冲向一个布满倒刺的铁丝网。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As the years went on, the cousins took their entrepreneurial pursuits more seriously, even attempting at one point to start a video arcade. Without any parents knowing, the boys picked out a spot for their arcade, got a lease, and started navigating the permit process for their business. Eventually, they had to get someone over eighteen to sign a legal document, and neither the Rives' father nor Errol would oblige. It would take a couple of decades, but Elon and the Rives would eventually go into business together.</p><p>随着时间的推移，兄弟们越加重视自己的创业追求，甚至试图开办一家街机游戏室。在父母都不知情的情况下，这几个男孩儿就为他们的游戏室选好了场地并拿到了租约，然后开始办理审批手续。最后，他们发现必须找到一个年满18周岁的人来签署一份法律文件，但无论是里沃的父亲还是埃罗尔都不愿意签字，他们只好放弃。几十年后，埃隆和里沃兄弟开始一起做生意。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The boys' most audacious exploits may have been their trips between Pretoria and Johannesburg. During the 1980s, South Africa could be a terribly violent place, and the thirty-five-mile train trip linking Pretoria and Johannesburg stood out as one of the world's more dangerous rides. Kimbal counted the train journeys as formative experiences for him and Elon. “South Africa was not a happy-go-lucky place, and that has an impact on you. We saw some really rough stuff. It was part of an atypical upbringing—just this insane set of experiences that changes how you view risk. You don't grow up thinking getting a job is the hard part. That's not interesting enough.”</p><p>男孩儿们最大胆的一次冒险是从比勒陀利亚到约翰内斯堡的旅行。20世纪80年代，南非暴力事件频发，而比勒陀利亚到约翰内斯堡的35英里车程，被认为是世界上最危险的旅程。在金巴尔看来，这次火车之旅对他们的成长影响深远。“南非不是一个随心所欲的幸运之地，并且这会对你产生影响。我们见到了一些非常野蛮的行为。这成为我们不同寻常成长历程的一部分——这一系列疯狂的体验，改变了我们对风险的看法。我们很难接受长大后仅仅为了一份工作而活着，因为这很无趣。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The boys ranged in age from about thirteen to sixteen and chased a mix of parties and geeky exploits in Johannesburg. During one jaunt, they went to a Dungeons & Dragons tournament. </p><p>这群13~16岁的男孩儿在约翰内斯堡热衷于参加各种派对和极客探险。在一次短途旅途中，他们还参加了“龙与地下城”比赛。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>“That was us being nerd master supremes,” Musk said. All of the boys were into the role-playing game, which requires someone to help set the mood for a contest by imagining and then describing a scene. “You have entered a room, and there is a chest in the corner. What will you do? . . . You open the chest. You've sprung a trap. Dozens of goblins are on the loose.” Elon excelled at this Dungeon Master role and had memorized the texts detailing the powers of monsters and other characters. “Under Elon's leadership, we played the role so well and won the tournament,” said Peter Rive. “Winning requires this incredible imagination, and Elon really set the tone for keeping people captivated and inspired.”</p><p>“这是我们这群书呆子的至高境界。”马斯克说。所有男孩儿都沉迷于这个角色扮演游戏。这个游戏需要玩家通过想象为他设定场景，并描述场景。“你走进了一个房间，角落里放着一个箱子。你要怎么做？……如果打开这个箱子，你就中了圈套，几十个小妖怪就自由了。”埃隆非常擅长“地牢之主”这个角色，并能背下每个怪物和其他角色的法力细节。“在埃隆的带领下，我们发挥得非常好，并赢得了比赛。要想赢得比赛，需要有一些不可思议的奇思妙想，埃隆设置的游戏氛围令人着迷并且大受鼓舞。”彼得·里沃说。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The Elon that his peers encountered at school was far less inspirational. Throughout middle and high school, Elon bounced around a couple of institutions. He spent the equivalent of eighth and ninth grades at Bryanston High School. One afternoon Elon and Kimbal were sitting at the top of a flight of concrete stairs eating when a boy decided to go after Elon. “I was basically hiding from this gang that was fucking hunting me down for God knows fucking why. I think I accidentally bumped this guy at assembly that morning and he'd taken some huge offense at that.” The boy crept up behind Musk, kicked him in the head, and then shoved him down the stairs. Musk tumbled down the entire flight, and a handful of boys pounced on him, some of them kicking Musk in the side and the ringleader bashing his head against the ground. “They were a bunch of fucking psychos,” Musk said. “I blacked out.” Kimbal watched in horror and feared for Elon's life. He rushed down the stairs to find Elon's face bloodied and swollen. “He looked like someone who had just been in the boxing ring,” Kimbal said. Elon then went to the hospital. “It was about a week before I could get back to school,” Musk said. (During a news conference in 2013, Elon disclosed that he'd had a nose job to deal with the lingering effects of this beating.)</p><p>而埃隆与学校里的同学相处得却不尽如人意。在初中和高中期间，埃隆辗转于好几所学校之间。他在布莱恩斯滕高中<sup>(Bryanston High School)</sup>读完了8年级和9年级。一天下午，埃隆和金巴尔坐在一段阶梯的顶部吃东西，这时一个男孩儿在他背后攻击他。“我一直躲着这个黑帮团伙，但不知道他们为什么要追着我不放。我猜可能是因为我在早会时不小心撞到了他，而他以为我故意冒犯。”那个男孩儿悄悄出现在马斯克身后，用脚踢他的脑袋，并把他推下了楼梯。马斯克从楼梯顶端滚了下去，然后一群男孩儿冲上来对他拳打脚踢。有些人站在两旁踢他，而元凶则抓住他的脑袋使劲撞击地面。“他们是一群疯子，”马斯克说，“我晕了过去。”金巴尔吓坏了，怕马斯克会丢了性命。他冲下楼梯，看到埃隆脸上血迹斑斑，并且已经肿起来了。埃隆被送到医院。“他看上去就像刚刚参加完拳击比赛，”金巴尔说，“大概一周之后我才回到学校。”<sup>(2013年，埃隆在一次新闻发布会上透露，这次被打的经历给他带来了后遗症，他因此做了鼻部整形手术。)</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>For three or four years, Musk endured relentless hounding at the hands of these bullies. They went so far as to beat up a boy that Musk considered his best friend until the child agreed to stop hanging out with Musk. “Moreover, they got him—they got my best fucking friend—to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up,” Musk said. “And that fucking hurt.” While telling this part of the story, Musk's eyes welled up and his voice quivered. “For some reason, they decided that I was it, and they were going to go after me nonstop. That's what made growing up difficult. For a number of years, there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the shit out of me, and then I'd come home, and it would just be awful there as well. It was just like nonstop horrible.”</p><p>马斯克被这群恶霸无休止地纠缠了三四年的时间。他们竟然殴打马斯克最好的一个朋友，直到那个孩子答应不再跟马斯克一起玩才收手。“此外，他们还利用他——我最好的朋友，引我出来，这样他们就可以打我，”马斯克说，“这太伤我心了。”当讲述这段往事的时候，马斯克的眼睛湿润了，声音在颤抖。“出于某种原因，他们决定无休止地纠缠我。这让我在成长过程中饱尝艰辛。那些年，我根本没有喘息的机会。这群人不停地纠缠，每次都把我打得狼狈不堪，然后我回到家里，但家里的氛围也同样可怕。这种恐惧似乎永无止境。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk spent the latter stages of his high school career at Pretoria Boys High School, where a growth spurt and the generally better behavior of the students made life more bearable. </p><p>马斯克在比勒陀利亚男子高中读完了高中的最后阶段，并快速成长起来，这里的学生行为端正，令他的生活惬意许多。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While a public school by definition, Pretoria Boys has functioned more like a private school for the last hundred years. It's the place you send a young man to get him ready to attend Oxford or Cambridge.</p><p>比勒陀利亚男子高中虽然是一所公立学校，但从过去一百年的运营状况来看，它更像是一所私立学校。来到这里的年轻人，都是准备申请牛津或剑桥大学的。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>The boys from Musk's class remember him as a likable, quiet, unspectacular student. “There were four or five boys that were considered the very brightest,” said Deon Prinsloo, who sat behind Elon in some classes. “Elon was not one of them.” Such comments were echoed by a half dozen boys who also noted that Musk's lack of interest in sports left him isolated in the midst of an athletics-obsessed culture. “Honestly, there were just no signs that he was going to be a billionaire,” said Gideon Fourie, another classmate. “He was never in a leadership position at school. I was rather surprised to see what has happened to him.”</p><p>在同学们的记忆中，马斯克是一名可爱、安静的普通学生。“班里有四五个男生被认为是最聪明的，”上某些课时坐在马斯克后面的迪昂·普林斯隆说道，“但埃隆不在其中。”有6名同学也指出，马斯克对体育缺乏兴趣，这让他在崇尚体育氛围的环境中被孤立起来。“说实话，没有迹象表明他将成为亿万富翁，”马斯克的另一个同学基甸·福里说，“他在学校里从来没有担任过一官半职，我对他取得的成就感到惊讶。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While Musk didn't have any close friends at school, his eccentric interests did leave an impression. One boy—Ted Wood—remembered Musk bringing model rockets to school and blasting them off during breaks. This was not the only hint of his aspirations. During a science-class debate, Elon gained attention for railing against fossil fuels in favor of solar power—an almost sacrilegious stance in a country devoted to mining the earth's natural resources. “He always had firm views on things,” said Wood. Terency Beney, a classmate who stayed in touch with Elon over the years, claimed that Musk had started fantasizing about colonizing other planets in high school as well.</p><p>尽管马斯克在学校里没有亲密的朋友，但他的古怪兴趣的确令人印象深刻。据一个叫泰得·伍德的男孩回忆，马斯克把自制的火箭模型带到学校，并在课间休息的时候点火发射火箭。这并不是展现他志趣的唯一迹象。在科学课的一场辩论会上，埃隆反对使用矿物燃料并支持太阳能，这引起了人们的注意——在一个致力发掘地球自然矿产的国家，这种立场近乎一种亵渎。伍德说，“他向来立场坚定。”而特雷斯·本尼与埃隆多年来一直保持联系，声称马斯克在高中时代就已经幻想过殖民其他星球。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>In another nod to the future, Elon and Kimbal were chatting during a class break outdoors when Wood interrupted them and asked what they were going on about. “They said, ‘We are talking about whether there is a need for branch banking in the financial industry and whether we will move to paperless banking.' I remember thinking that was such an absurd comment to make. I said, ‘Yeah, that's great.'”*</p><p>与马斯克前程有关的另一个线索是：有一次，埃隆和金巴尔在课间休息的时候在户外聊天，伍德打断了他们的谈话并问他们在聊什么。“他们回答说，‘我们在聊银行业是否需要营业网点，以及能否使银行体系实现无纸化运作。’我当时心想，这种想法太荒谬了。我于是说‘这个想法好极了’。”<sup>[5]</sup></p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>While Musk might not have been among the academic elite in his class, he was among a handful of students with the grades and self-professed interest to be selected for an experimental computer program. Students were plucked out of a number of schools and brought together to learn the BASIC, COBOL, and Pascal programming languages. Musk continued to augment these technological leanings with his love of science fiction and fantasy and tried his hand at writing stories that involved dragons and supernatural beings. “I wanted to write something like Lord of the Rings,” he said.</p><p>虽然马斯克不是班级里的尖子生，但他和其他几个中学生因为成绩和兴趣，被选中参加一项实验性的计算机学习计划。许多学校挑选出一些学生，把他们聚集在一起学习BASIC、Cobol和Pascal等汇编语言。通过阅读最喜爱的科幻小说，马斯克对技术的偏好开始升温，他还着手写作关于龙和超自然的故事。他说：“我想写一个像《指环王》那样的故事。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Maye viewed these high school years through a mother's eyes and recounted plenty of tales of Musk performing spectacular academic feats. The video game he wrote, she said, impressed much older, more experienced techies. He aced math exams well beyond his years. And he had that incredible memory. The only reason he did not outrank the other boys was a lack of interest in the work prescribed by the school.</p><p>梅耶从一位母亲的角度，见证了马斯克那些年的高中生活，并且讲述了他大量的惊人学术成绩。“他开发的计算机游戏，”她说，“令许多比他年长且经验丰富的技术人员感到震惊。”他优异的数学成绩和他的年龄极不相称。他的记忆力令人难以置信。他之所以没有从其他男孩儿里面脱颖而出，仅仅是因为他对学校规定的科目缺乏兴趣。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>As Musk saw it, “I just look at it as ‘What grades do I need to get where I want to go?' There were compulsory subjects like Afrikaans, and I just didn't see the point of learning that. It seemed ridiculous. I'd get a passing grade and that was fine. Things like physics and computers—I got the highest grade you can get in those. There needs to be a reason for a grade. I'd rather play video games, write software, and read books than try and get an A if there's no point in getting an A. I can remember failing subjects in like fourth and fifth grade. Then, my mother's boyfriend told me I'd be held back if I didn't pass. I didn't actually know you had to pass the subjects to move to the next grade. I got the best grades in class after that.”</p><p>马斯克是这么看待这件事情的：“我只是考虑‘对于我需要掌握的科目，我应该取得什么样的成绩’。有一些必修科目，比如南非荷兰语，我完全不明白学它有什么意义。这看起来很荒唐。只要考试分数及格，我就满意了。但有些科目，比如物理和计算机，我会尽我所能取得最好的成绩。取得的每一个成绩都是有原因的。我宁愿玩计算机游戏、写代码和读书，也不愿意去获得那些没有意义的A等。我记得在四五年级时，曾有几门功课不及格。然后，我母亲的男朋友告诉我，如果我没有通过考试就要留级。我不知道只有这些科目考试合格才能升入下一个年级。此后，我在这些科目上取得了最好的成绩。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>At seventeen, Musk left South Africa for Canada. He has recounted this journey quite often in the press and typically leans on two descriptions of the motivation for his flight. The short version is that Musk wanted to get to the United States as quickly as possible and could use Canada as a pit stop via his Canadian ancestry. The second go-to story that Musk relies on has more of a social conscience. South Africa required military service at the time. Musk wanted to avoid joining the military, he has said, because it would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime.</p><p>17岁时，马斯克离开南非前往加拿大。他经常在媒体面前谈到这次旅程，而且对于这次旅程的动机有两种版本的描述。第一个版本比较简短，即他可以凭借自己的加拿大血统，以加拿大为跳板，尽快前往美国；第二个版本是，他拥有非同一般的社会良知。南非当时要求公民必须服兵役，而马斯克则不想入伍，他曾经说，这是因为他不想被迫参与到种族隔离运动中去。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>What rarely gets mentioned is that Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months before heading off on his grand adventure. He began pursuing physics and engineering but put lackluster effort into the work and soon dropped out of school. Musk characterized the time at university as just something to do while he awaited his Canadian documentation. In addition to being an inconsequential part of his life, Musk lazing through school to avoid South Africa's required military service rather undermines the tale of a brooding, adventurous youth that he likes to tell, which is likely why the stint at the University of Pretoria never seems to come up.</p><p>在义无反顾地投身于这场华丽冒险的5个月前，马斯克进入了比勒陀利亚大学学习物理学和工程学，但是他没有把精力投入到学习中去，很快就辍学了。这件事很少被提及。马斯克描述说，申请读大学只是为了让等待加拿大签证的那段日子有事可做。马斯克那时候在学校里游手好闲，这不仅仅是他人生中无关紧要的一部分，实际上是为了逃避兵役。他一向自我标榜为深思熟虑又热爱冒险的青年，为了不破坏这一形象，他很少提及这段在比勒陀利亚大学的沉寂时光。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>There's no question, though, that Musk had been pining to get to the United States on a visceral level for a long time. Musk's early inclination toward computers and technology had fostered an intense interest in Silicon Valley, and his trips overseas had reinforced the idea that America was the place to get things done. South Africa, by contrast, presented far less opportunity for an entrepreneurial soul. As Kimbal put it, “South Africa was like a prison for someone like Elon.”</p><p>毫无疑问，为了去美国，马斯克已经深思熟虑了很长时间。马斯克早期对于计算机和科技的兴趣使他对硅谷产生了强烈的向往。而那些海外之旅又令他深信美国是成事之地。相反，南非为创业者提供的机会少之又少。就像金巴尔所说的，“南非对于埃隆这样的人来说就像是监狱”。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p>Musk's opportunity to flee arrived with a change in the law that allowed Maye to pass her Canadian citizenship to her children. Musk immediately began researching how to complete the paperwork for this process. It took about a year to receive the approvals from the Canadian government and to secure a Canadian passport. “That's when Elon said, ‘I'm leaving for Canada,'” Maye said. In these pre-Internet days, Musk had to wait three agonizing weeks to get a plane ticket. Once it arrived, and without flinching, he left home for good.</p><p>马斯克逃离南非的机会终于来了，调整后的法律允许子女继承梅耶的加拿大国籍。马斯克立即开始研究办理这一手续所需要的文书。马斯克大约花了一年时间，最终获得了加拿大政府的批准并拿到了加拿大护照。“这时候埃隆才说‘我要去加拿大’。”梅耶说。在互联网问世之前，马斯克在煎熬中等待了三个星期才拿到机票。一拿到机票，他便毫不犹豫地离开了家，再也没有回来。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[1]</sup>在儿子出生两年后，约翰·埃隆开始表现出糖尿病的一些症状。在当时得了糖尿病无异于被宣判了死刑，尽管只有32岁，但约翰·埃隆知道他可能只有6个月左右的生命了。阿尔梅达有一点护理经验，她执意要用一个秘方来延长约翰·埃隆的生命。根据家族记载，她采用脊柱按摩法作为有效的治疗手段，让约翰·埃隆在被诊断出患有糖尿病后又活了5年。这种可以延长生命的脊椎推拿疗法已成为霍尔德曼家族的一个传统。阿尔梅达就读于明尼阿波利斯按摩学校，于1905年获得了按摩医生的学位。马斯克的外曾祖母之后开设了自己的诊所，据说她是加拿大的第一个按摩师。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[2]</sup>霍尔德曼也进入了政坛，试图在萨斯喀彻温省建立自己的政党，出版报刊，宣扬保守、反社会主义的思想。他之后还竞选过议员和社会信用党<sup>(Social Credit Party)</sup>的主席，但都没有成功。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[3]</sup>在这段旅途中，他们北上非洲海岸，穿越了阿拉伯半岛，途经伊朗、印度和马来西亚，再南下直接飞抵东帝汶和澳大利亚。他们准备那些必要的签证和文书足足用了一年时间，并且沿途还要忍受阵阵胃痛，不确定的行程也令他们苦不堪言。“爸爸在飞跃东帝汶海的时候晕了过去，妈妈不得不承担起驾驶任务，直到我们到达澳大利亚。爸爸在飞机快降落的时候才醒过来，”斯科特·霍尔德曼说，“这是疲劳所致。”</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[4]</sup>约书亚和温都是熟练的神枪手，都赢得过全国射击比赛。在20世纪50年代中期，他们在从开普敦到阿尔及尔全 000英里的汽车拉力赛中胜出，击败了福特车队的职业选手，获得第一名。</p></div>
<div class='layout'><p></p><p><sup>[5]</sup>马斯克不记得这次对话了。“我认为这些回忆当中有一些创作的成分，”他说，“这是有可能的，在高中的最后几年，我确实有过许多深奥的对话，但我更关心技术层面，而不是银行系统。”</p></div>
