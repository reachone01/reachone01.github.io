On the back of the photo is a poem he wrote: Wind and dust are my companions, The end of the earth is my home. - The Exile After Cousin Hu was bought out of prison by his father in 1947, he gave this photograph to a friend and asked him to give it to my mother, so that she would know he was alive. Because of the siege, the friend did not see my mother until after the Communists had taken Jinzhou; seeing her in love with my father he decided not to give her the photo. He only passed it to her after a chance meeting in 1985; it was then that she learned that Cousin Hu had died in the Cutltural Revolution.</p>

<p style="text-indent:-2em;">31 ↓ At the memorial service for my father (I am standing with my family, fourth from right). An official is reading the Party's valedictory. Chengdu, 21 April 1975. this speech was extremely important, as it was the Party's assessment of my father, and would determine his children's future even though he himself was dead. Becasue my father had criticised Mao, who was still alive, the original version was ominously negative. My mother fought for changes and won a much improved compromise. The memorial service was organised by a 'funeral committee' of my father's former collegues, including people who had helped to persecute him. It was carefully staged down to the last detail, and was attended by about five hundred people, according to a prescribed formula. Even the size of the wreaths was specified.</p>
