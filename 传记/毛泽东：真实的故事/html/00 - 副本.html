﻿<p>1 Only the names of the more important individuals are given, and not all pseudonyms are included.</p>


<p>2 The imperial exams were the primary path to official service in China during the dynastic era.</p>


<p>3 Most likely Mao was not impressed. According to his granddaughter, Kong Dongmei, at this time the fourteen-year-old Mao Zedong was in love with another girl, his cousin Wang Shigu, but unfortunately for him, their horoscopes did not match and the local geomancer would not allow the marriage.</p>


<p>4 Later, conversing with Edgar Snow, Mao reduced the number of rooms to just one, probably to impress upon Snow just how poor he had been at the time.</p>


<p>5 In fairness we should note that Mao might have become acquainted with another translation of The Communist Manifesto, which, according to the memoirs of Luo Zhanglong, was mimeographed by students at Peking University. But whether this is really true is not known for certain.</p>


<p>6 In 1885, for example, the ratio of Chinese to foreigners in the International Settlement was 35 to 1, and in the French Concession there were 25,000 Chinese and 300 foreigners.</p>


<p>7 The Chinese system of education in the 1920s had some unique features. There were three levels in primary school—lower, middle, and high. Therefore, graduates of the highest level of primary school might be in the sixteen- to seventeen-year-old age range.</p>


<p>8 Kunlun is a mountain range in southwestern China.</p>


<p>9 An entire company of Chinese communists who knew Russian served Borodin. Working with Qu were Zhang Tailei and his wife, and graduates of Moscow’s Communist University of the Toilers of the East: Li Zhongwu (a nephew of Liang Qichao), Huang Ping, Fu Daqing, and Bu Shiji.</p>


<p>10 In these years, it was customary for Chinese intellectuals to sign their names using the Latin alphabet in the Western fashion, using only initials for their personal names and placing these before their family names. They employed the transliteration system then in use, the so-called Wade-Giles system named after its creators, the British professors Thomas Francis Wade (1818–1895) and Herbert Allen Giles (1845–1935). It is substantially different from the system adopted by the UN in the early 1970s. In the Wade-Giles system, T. S. Chen means Tu-siu Chen, T. C. Li is Ta-chao Li, and T. T. Mao is Tse-tung Mao.</p>


<p>11 It will be recalled that Mao’s father owned 22 mu, or about 3.5 acres of land. After his death the land was inherited by his three sons.</p>


<p>12 Following this, rumors circulated within the CCP for a time that Li Lisan, hoping to get rid of his wife, had encouraged her to seduce Cai Hesen. At this time he was supposedly madly in love with her younger sister. Whether this was really true we don’t know, but it is a historical fact that Li and Cai hated each other.</p>


<p>13 Hakka rebellions in China were infrequent. The most famous of them was the Taiping Rebellion (1851–1864) as a result of which more than twenty million people perished.</p>


<p>14 In Hunan province, for example, there were 23 supplementary taxes while in neighboring Hubei there were 61. In the eastern province of Jiangsu there were no less than 147.</p>


<p>15 Persistent rumors circulated in Wuhan that in Liling county, Hunan, the peasant union had executed the father of Li Lisan, a rural teacher, as a tuhao and lieshen. Fortunately, this information proved to be wrong.</p>


<p>16 These were the China specialists Evgenii Sigismundovich Iolk (1900–1937 or 1942), who worked in China under the pseudonyms Johan and Johanson, and Mikhail Volin (real name Semen Natanovich Belen’kii (1896–1938). In 1926–27 they were on Borodin’s staff and were working on agrarian issues in China. In early 1927 they even published a two-volume documentary study in English, edited by Borodin, called The Peasant Question in Guangdong. Moreover, Volin reviewed Mao Zedong’s “Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society” in Canton, the journal of the Soviet advisers.</p>


<p>17 The reference is to the nine tributaries of the Yangzi.</p>


<p>18 The reference is to the Beijing–Hankou railroad and the Wuchang–Changsha railroad, which intersect in Wuhan.</p>


<p>19 Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain are two hills on opposite sides of the Yangzi. The former is located in Hanyang, the latter in Wuchang. It is on Snake Mountain that the Yellow Crane Tower rises.</p>


<p>20 The legend goes that long ago in Wuchang a young man named Xin had a wine shop. One day Xin, a well-known and well-liked fellow, gave wine to a wandering Daoist monk. In gratitude on the wall of the shop the monk drew a picture of a crane that turned out to be magical. Every time when someone clapped their hands the crane would perform graceful dances. The young man was ineffably happy for now his shop was always crowded with people who wanted to gaze upon the miraculous crane while downing a cup or two. But after ten years the Daoist monk again showed up in Wuchang. He dropped in to Xin’s shop, drew forth a flute, played upon it, mounted the crane, and flew off to heaven. To commemorate these happenings Xin’s family built the Yellow Crane Tower upon the site of the shop. According to historical data, the tower was built in 223 CE.</p>


<p>21 In addition to Qu, the new leadership was made up of Zhang Guotao, Zhang Tailei, Li Weihan, Li Lisan, and Zhou Enlai.</p>


<p>22 This name is sometimes erroneously transliterated as Meyer.</p>


<p>23 At the time the hammer on the flag of the CCP was indeed commonly mistaken for an axe.</p>


<p>24 Later, Mao, recalling this time, observed ironically, “So, as soon as I became a democratic figure [i.e., not a communist], they could appoint me division commander.”</p>


<p>25 It is worth noting that Zhao Xiangui, Zetan’s first wife, at just this time was risking her life by engaging in underground work in Changsha. Returning from Moscow in the spring of 1927, she began to put into practice in Hunan what she had learned in Moscow, organizing a peasant movement or, to be more precise, a movement of paupers and rural lumpen proletarians. After Xu Kexiang’s mutiny in Changsha on May 21, 1927, she was put behind bars, but she was freed the following January. In early 1931 she left for Wuhan, where for security reasons she changed her name to Zhao Lingying. Subsequently she was sent to work in Shanghai, then in Nanjing, and finally in Jinan, the provincial capital of Shandong. There she married the secretary of the Shandong party committee, but in the summer of 1932 first her husband and then she was seized by the Guomindang and executed.</p>


<p>26 She survived until the victory of the revolution. For a while she worked in the Mao Zedong Museum in Shaoshan, and then she moved to Changsha. There she died of illness in July 1964, at the age of sixty-eight.</p>


<p>27 The Guomindang government followed the example of the first ruler of the Ming dynasty, which established its capital at Nanjing (Southern capital) and renamed the former capital Beiping (Northern peace).</p>


<p>28 Eight persons made up this delegation. Three of them (Qu Qiubai, Zhang Guotao, and Huang Ping) were considered representatives of the CCP to the ECCI, two others (Lu Dingyi and Liu Mingfu) representatives of the Chinese Communist Youth League to the Youth Comintern, and another two (Deng Zhongxia and Yu Fei) representatives of the ACFTU to the Profintern, the international trade union organization. This was the first time such a delegation had been formed. Prior to this, the CCP had been represented in Moscow by unaffiliated individuals.</p>


<p>29 Nevertheless, he and Zhu De, who likewise did not take part in the conference, were elected in absentia as honorary chairmen.</p>


<p>30 Zhu became the commander of the First Front Army, Peng his deputy commander. Mao served as general political commissar.</p>


<p>31 The decision of the Chinese Politburo to establish the CRMC was adopted on October 17, 1930, the same date as the formation of the Bureau of the Central Committee. At that time, Mao Zedong’s district was called the Central Soviet Area. Until then, beginning in June 1930, a so-called Chinese Revolutionary Military Council had operated in the Soviet districts in Jiangxi; in August it was rechristened the Chinese Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Council. It functioned as the highest organ of military-bureaucratic power in the territories that Mao controlled, and all the local armed forces of the CCP as well as the Jiangxi Soviet government were subordinated to it. From the very beginning Mao served as chairman. However, he did not concern himself with administrative problems; rather he devoted all his attention to political and military questions.</p>


<p>32 At the time, it was better to accuse your opponent of a “right” rather than a “left” deviation. It was more of a sure thing.</p>


<p>33 On December 30, 1930, near Longgang village, the decisive battle took place in which the Guomindang punitive forces were defeated and the division commander Zhang was taken captive.</p>


<p>34 Many years later one of these subordinates of Zhou gave a simple explanation of the crime. Prior to Gu Shunzhang’s betrayal many meetings of the top party leadership had taken place in his home, and so every one in his household knew the CCP leaders personally. It was impossible to rely upon their keeping silent.</p>


<p>35 It is interesting to note that in the mid-1960s in various provinces throughout China there suddenly appeared several dozen “Mao Anlongs.” These pretenders, however, were quickly unmasked by the all-knowing security organs.</p>


<p>36 The law did not talk directly about confiscating the land of peasants (other than that of “kulaks”), but that is the only way one can interpret the clause regarding the expropriation not only of dizhu land, but also that of “big private owners” who “engaged in working the land themselves.” Not a single dizhu worked his own land, only peasants did this. The definition of “big,” it will be recalled, could not confuse anyone. For the destitute rural lumpen proletariat anyone with land was a “big” landowner.</p>


<p>37 The humor is built upon wordplay. The expression xiao maomao actually has a dual meaning. It can be translated either as “hairy little one” or as “little fur ball.” Thus many in China affectionately call their newborn babies after the soft, downy hair on their heads, but it can also mean “Little Double Mao” if Mao is the character for the surname Mao rather than the character mao that means “hair.”</p>


<p>38 This was Dong Biwu, secretary of the Control Commission and deputy rector of the Higher Party School. In the past, he had stood up for He Zizhen’s sister, He Yi.</p>


<p>39 The Wumeng Mountains straddle Guizhou and Yunnan.</p>


<p>40 The Min Mountains range along the Sichuan-Qinghai-Gansu border.</p>


<p>41 A. M. Khamadan (real name Faingar) was a Jew born in Derbent in 1908. After working at Pravda, he moved to Novy mir (New world), where he was deputy to the editor in chief. At the beginning of World War II he was a TASS correspondent. In 1942 he was taken prisoner by the Nazis in Sevastopol, Crimea. He conducted underground work in the POW camp under the Russian name of Mikhailov, and was put into prison and then executed in May 1943.</p>


<p>42 In 1926–27 Borodin even referred to Song Qingling as “the only man in the entire left-wing Guomindang.”</p>


<p>43 Stalin supposed that the Chinese communists would convene their regular Seventh Congress of the CCP in the coming months.</p>


<p>44 It is interesting that most scholars erroneously identify the editor of one of the philosophical works that influenced Mao as one M. Shirokov, even though it was the rather well-known philosopher and party official Ivan Mikhailovich Shirokov (1899–1984), who, subsequently, in 1945–46, served as the acting head of propaganda for the Leningrad municipal party committee.</p>


<p>45 In the mid-1930s Captain Carlson served as one of Roosevelt’s bodyguards and became a friend to the president. Before his departure for China in July 1937, he received a letter from the president requesting that he inform him privately (“just between us”) about everything going on in China. For reasons of confidentiality, Carlson had to address his correspondence to the president’s secretary, Marguerite “Missy” LeHand.</p>


<p>46 In a translation of this sentence into Chinese from the late 1940s and early 1950s, this statement is not in quotation marks, that is, it is presented as Mao Zedong’s own revelation. In what became the classical formulation, it goes as follows: “Once the political line is established, the decisive factor is cadres.”</p>


<p>47 It is worth noting that just a year before the Sixth Plenum, in his lectures on dialectical materialism, Mao expressed precisely the opposite thought. “[We] must,” he said then, “struggle with all the outworn philosophies now existing in China, raise the flag of criticism on the ideological front throughout the whole country, and thereby liquidate the philosophical heritage of ancient China.” Evidently he did not stay in one place.</p>


<p>48 Many years later, in a conversation with the American writer Roxane Witke, Jiang Qing denied that Mao had thought up her new name. She claimed to have invented it herself. Jiang Qing’s assertion, however, contradicts other sources.</p>


<p>49 Ren Bishi and his wife returned to Yan’an along with Zhou and his wife. Lin Biao (under the pseudonym of Li Ting), who had come to the USSR for medical treatment in January 1939, stayed on as acting representative of the CCP to the Comintern. He discharged this responsibility until August 1941, after which he too returned to Yan’an. Subsequently, by agreement with the ECCI, the Central Committee of the CCP sent no more representatives to Moscow.</p>


<p>50 It is worth noting that several years later, in early 1949, the pathologically suspicious Stalin wrote to Mao, “We have reliable information that the American writer Anna Louise Strong is an American spy. . . . She has long served the Americans as a spy. We advise you not to allow her into your midst or into areas occupied by the CCP.” Naturally, this was typical Stalinist gibberish. In reality, Anna Louise Strong was a passionate supporter of the communist movement in China. In 1958 she even moved to the PRC, where she lived out her days. (She died in 1970.) She was buried in Beijing in Babaoshan, the cemetery for heroes, and on her gravestone the following words were inscribed: “Friend of the Chinese people, progressive American journalist.” Incidentally, Agnes Smedley, who died in 1950, was also buried at Babaoshan.</p>


<p>51 Pugachev was a famous Cossack leader of a large-scale Russian peasant rebellion in the eighteenth century.</p>


<p>52 Li Zicheng (1605 or 1606–1645) was the leader of a vast popular uprising at the end of the Ming dynasty. In 1644 he captured Beijing and was proclaimed emperor, but he could not maintain control in the city—that is, in Mao’s figure of speech, he couldn’t pass the exams. Under the blows of the Manchus he had to retreat, and he was killed in the summer of 1645.</p>


<p>53 Ever since then in the PRC, in addition to the ruling CCP there have been eight minuscule so-called democratic parties that formed a united front with the communists. They have never constituted a real opposition to the CCP one-party dictatorship and have been a kind of democratic window-dressing. In the early 1950s some of their members even held positions in the so-called coalition government.</p>


<p>54 In her reminiscences, Li Min writes that it was the special plenipotentiary of the Soviet Union, Pavel Yudin; however, Yudin did not come to China until 1950. Stalin’s special representative in China in 1949 was Kovalev.</p>

<p>56 On March 22, 1950, the Politburo of the CPSU approved the draft by the Soviet Council of Ministers, “On Securing Joint Administration of the Chinese Changchun Railroad.”</p>


<p>57 At this time the Security Council consisted of eleven members, including the five permanent members possessing the right of the veto. These five were the United States, the USSR, Chiang Kai-shek’s Republic of China, Great Britain, and France.</p>


<p>58 According to the majority of Western specialists, during the First Five-Year Plan, Soviet industry grew by an annual rate of 12 percent. It is doubtful, however, that Stalin trusted Western statistics.</p>


<p>59 Li Lisan was elected a member of the CCP Central Committee on Mao’s initiative in June 1945 at the Seventh Party Congress. It is worth mentioning that at the time he was still in Moscow and he was not even a member of the party because he had been expelled. But Mao wanted to play the role of unifier of the CCP; that is why he forgave Li.</p>


<p>60 Kovalev mistakenly asserts that this took place at an enlarged plenum of the Politburo on July 27, 1949. On July 27, however, a Politburo meeting was not held but rather there was an exchange of opinions among Stalin, Bulganin, and Vyshinsky on one side and Liu Shaoqi, Gao Gang, and Wang Jiaxiang on the other. The Politburo meeting was held on July 11.</p>


<p>61 Tibet, which had retained its formally independent status under the Guomindang, was conquered by the PLA in 1950–51.</p>


<p>62 No names are mentioned in the published text of Mao’s speech. However, the Chinese publishers of his speech supplied notes to the published text that indicate the target was Liu Shaoqi and his supporters.</p>


<p>63 The Soviet Union agreed to return its shares to China on January 1, 1955, in exchange for Chinese goods.</p>


<p>64 This physician was named Li Zhisui. He worked in Mao’s entourage for more than twelve years. In 1988 by some miracle he was able to leave China for the United States, where six years later he published his memoirs. In them he revealed many secrets of the private life of Mao Zedong and other leaders of the CCP, which evoked a storm of indignation in the PRC. Afterward, in an interview with U.S. television in January 1995, Dr. Li announced his intention to publish one more work of biography. He was unable, however, to carry out this intention. Several weeks after the interview, he died in Carol Stream, Illinois.</p>


<p>65 That NKVD investigators did not conduct inquiries on their own say-so is attested to in Khrushchev’s report “On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences.”</p>


<p>66 Two versions of Mao’s speech exist, the uncorrected stenographic report and a partially edited canonical text. A translation of the first appeared in the West and in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The official document was published in the PRC in 1976. The formula “build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically” is only in the stenographic account. In a note, however, the editors of the fifth volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong confirm that in his speech Mao did indeed propose this idea as the general line for socialist construction.</p>


<p>67 Zhou Enlai was the first to put forward the formula of “socialist construction according to the principle of ‘more, faster, better, and more economically.’ ” He did this on January 14, 1956, in a report to a conference about intellectuals convened by the Central Committee at which he developed Mao’s ideas presented on December 6, 1955. However, he did not impart any “revolutionary” meaning to this formula.</p>


<p>68 Nevertheless, it soon became known outside China. For example, members of a delegation from the Yugoslavian Communist Union referred to “The Ten Major Relationships” during their talk with Mao Zedong in September 1956.</p>


<p>69 In his memoirs, Khrushchev mistakenly asserts that Kang Sheng was a member of Liu Shaoqi’s delegation.</p>


<p>70 Liu learned of this from information provided him by Khrushchev, who had received it from Mikoyan and KGB head Ivan Aleksandrovich Serov, then in Hungary.</p>


<p>71 Palmiro Togliatti (pseudonym Mario Ercoli) (1893–1964) was a member of the Presidium of the ECCI from 1938 to 1943 and also a member of the Secretariat of the ECCI from 1935 to 1943.</p>


<p>72 The first primitive blast furnaces were established in China in the spring of 1958. By June there were 12,680. But the real epidemic of steel making began in August.</p>


<p>73 The Chinese communists continued the bombardment on alternate days for the next twenty years.</p>


<p>74 Khrushchev conveyed this information via China’s ambassador Liu Xiao, who was specially summoned to Yalta for four days where Khrushchev was resting.</p>


<p>75 At that time the main advocate within the leadership of the CPSU of a hard line toward the PRC was Mikhail Andreevich Suslov, the secretary for ideology in the Central Committee. It was he who convinced Khrushchev that the Chinese should be harshly condemned for exacerbating tensions in the Taiwan Strait.</p>


<p>76 Burlatsky mistakenly wrote that this was Liu Shaoqi.</p>


<p>77 Kun Peng (the roc) is a gigantic bird referred to in Chapter One of Zhuangzi.</p>


<p>78 Li is a traditional Chinese unit of distance, an equivalent of 1,640.42 feet.</p>


<p>79 Mao is referring to the treaty banning nuclear testing in the atmosphere, outer space, and under water signed in Moscow by the U.S., USSR, and Great Britain on August 5, 1963.</p>


<p>80 Mao is mocking Khrushchev’s description in April 1964 that communism is a plateful of goulash for everybody.</p>


<p>81 This was mistaken. Herman Willemse was actually from Holland.</p>


<p>82 Prior to this, besides Lin Biao there were four other deputy chairmen: Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen Yun.</p>


<p>83 This was the name of the base of the rebellious peasants in the novel Water Margin.</p>


<p>84 Semyon Kuz’mich Tsvigun (1917–1982) was first deputy chairman of the KGB from November 1967.</p>


<p>85 Even Otto Braun, who despised Lin Biao, was compelled to point out in one of his reports to the ECCI that “I personally consider him [Lin Biao] to be the best field commander in the Eighth Route Army.”</p>


<p>86 Lin Biao was married twice. His first wife, Liu Xingmin (she was also known both as Liu Xinmin and as Zhang Mei), was twelve years younger than he. She was a simple, unlettered girl from northern Shaanxi. In 1939 she went with her husband to the Soviet Union. But after two years, Lin broke with her. He returned to China in August 1941, leaving her pregnant in Moscow. Liu gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Xiaolin. Until September 1948 Liu worked in the International Orphanage in Ivanovo, where, it will be recalled, Mao’s former wife Zizhen was for a time. Then she returned to China. Xiaolin was able to leave for China only in 1950 after Lin Biao himself interceded on her behalf. However, he saw this daughter only rarely. He now had a different family. During the anti-Japanese war he married a native of Fujian named Ye Qun, who was also twelve years his junior. He had two children from this marriage: Lin Liheng (Doudou), the daughter born in 1944, and a son, Lin Liguo, born in 1946.</p>


<p>87 It will be recalled that in the early 1930s Dong Biwu (1886–1975) was the secretary of the Party Control Commission. From 1959 on he and Song Qingling were vice chairmen of the PRC.</p>


<p>88 At a press conference Bhutto said the meeting had lasted twenty-one minutes, but the Chinese said later that Mao met with the Pakistani premier for no more than ten minutes. This is just how long he spoke with Lee Kuan Yew.</p>


<p>89 The name was created by Mao Zedong, who did not want to give his grandson one more name, which would meet the requirements of the genealogical chronology of his clan. In general, after the communist takeover the tradition to name children in accordance with the clan chronologies disappeared. For a long time the Mao family called the little boy Maomao (“Fine Hairs”). As we know, it was also an informal name of one of Mao Zedong and He Zizhen’s sons, Mao Anhong.</p>


<p>90 Hao Mingli passed away in Qincheng municipal prison (Jiangxi province). She had been imprisoned in May 2002, when she began to quarrel with Mao Xinyu after learning that he wanted to divorce her.</p>


<p>91 The name was devised by Mao Zedong and the infant’s paternal grandfather.</p>


<p>92 Mao named her. He took the character dong (east) from his own name and combined it with the character mei (plum blossom). He had a lifelong love for plum blossoms.</p>


<p>93 Li Na came up with this name.</p>
