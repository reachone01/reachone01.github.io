<a href="../pic/5.png" title="../pic/5.png"><img src="../pic/5.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  Sun Yat-sen's detention in the Chinese Legation in London in 1896 created an international incident, raised his profile and helped make him the 'Father of China'. In this British newspaper sketch, Sun is shown (centre, with coat on his arm) being released with a police escort. He is taking the arm of Dr Cantlie, his former teacher who had rescued him.</p>
<a href="../pic/6.png" title="../pic/6.png"><img width="100%" src="../pic/6.png" /></a> 
<p> ↓  Sun (front row, sixth from left) was the 'interim president' when the republic was declared on 1 January 1912; but he had to step down on 13 February, the day this photograph was taken. Huang Xing (front row, fourth from left) was the second most influential man among the republicans.</p>
<a href="../pic/7.png" title="../pic/7.png"><img width="100%" src="../pic/7.png" /></a>
