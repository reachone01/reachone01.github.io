<div class='layout'><p>Chapter 6 THE INNER BODY</p><p>第六章 内在身体</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>BEING IS YOUR DEEPEST SELF</p><p>本体是你最深处的自我</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>You spoke earlier about the importance of having deep roots within or inhabiting the body. Can you explain what you meant by that?</p><p>你先前说过往内在扎根，或进驻身体的重要性。你可以做个解释吗？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The body can become a point of access into the realm of Being. Let's go into that more deeply now.</p><p>身体可以变成进入本体（存在）领域的入口点。我们现在就深入一些看看。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I am still not quite sure if I fully understand what you mean by Being.</p><p>我还是不太了解你说的本体<sup>(存在)</sup>是什么意思？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Water? What do you mean by that? I don't understand it." This is what a fish would say if it had a human mind.</p><p>“水？水是什么意思？我不懂。”这就是一条鱼用人类的心智会说出来的话。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Please stop trying to understand Being. You have already had significant glimpses of Being, but the mind will always try to squeeze it into a little box and then put a label on it. It cannot be done. It cannot become an object of knowledge. In Being, subject and object merge into one.</p><p>请你停止尝试去了解本体（存在）。你已经对本体（存在）有了相当的瞥见。可是心智老想着要把它塞进一个框框里面，再贴上一个标签。这是行不通的。它不能变成一个知识的标的。在本体（存在）里，主观和客观是融合为一的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Being can be felt as the ever-present I am that is beyond name and form. To feel and thus to know that you are and to abide in that deeply rooted state is enlightenment, is the truth that Jesus says will make you free.</p><p>在超越名相的永恒的“我是”（I am）里，本体（存在）才可以被觉受得到。先有感觉并且因此知道“你是”，而又安住在这个如如不动的状态里，就是开悟。也就是耶稣说过的可以让你自由的真理。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Free from what?</p><p>挣脱什么的自由？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Free from the illusion that you are nothing more than your physical body and your mind. This "illusion of the self," as the Buddha calls it, is the core error. Free from fear in its countless disguises as the inevitable consequence of that illusion — the fear that is your constant tormentor as long as you derive your sense of self only from this ephemeral and vulnerable form. And free from sin, which is the suffering you unconsciously inflict on yourself and others as long as this illusory sense of self governs what you think, say, and do.</p><p>挣脱幻相的自由。认为你只是你的形体和心智的幻相。这个佛陀称为“我相”的幻觉，是一个核心的误谬。挣脱了由这个幻相所生的无数恐惧虚假的自由——这种恐惧便是你从这个梦幻泡影的形相，汲取你的自我感时，便如影随形的苦因。还有挣脱罪恶的自由。这个罪恶就是你虚幻的自我感主导着你的思考、说话、和行动时，你无意识地加诸在自己和他人身上的痛苦。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>LOOK BEYOND THE WORDS</p><p>超越文字相</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I don't like the word sin. It implies that I am being judged and found guilty.</p><p>我不喜欢罪恶这个字。它隐含着我被批判，并且被宣判有罪的意思。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I can understand that. Over the centuries, many erroneous views and interpretations have accumulated around words such as sin, due to ignorance, misunderstanding, or a desire to control, but they contain an essential core of truth. If you are unable to look beyond such interpretations and so cannot recognize the reality to which the word points, then don't use it. Don't get stuck on the level of words. A word is no more than a means to an end. It's an abstraction. Not unlike a signpost, it points beyond itself. The word honey isn't honey. You can study and talk about honey for as long as you like, but you won't really know it until you taste it. After you have tasted it, the word becomes less important to you. You won't be attached to it anymore. Similarly, you can talk or think about God continuously for the rest of your life, but does that mean you know or have even glimpsed the reality to which the word points? It really is no more than an obsessive attachment to a signpost, a mental idol.</p><p>我能了解。几世纪以来，许多像罪恶之类的文字，因为人类的无明、误解或控制欲，而导致了错误的观点和诠释。不过这些文字里包含了真理的核心。如果你不能超越言诠，而无法认知文字所指涉的实相的话，就不要使用它们。不要被文字障所困。文字充其量只是达到目的的手段罢了。文字是抽象的。它和一个指引身外之物的指示牌没有两样。蜂蜜这个字并不是蜂蜜。你尽管研究、讨论蜂蜜，可是除非你亲口尝过，你才会真正地知道它的滋味。一旦尝过之后，文字就不那么重要了。你也不会再对它执着不放了。同样的道理，你大可耗尽你的下半辈子，不断地谈论或思考“神”，可是这样就表示你知道，或者瞥见了“神”这个字所指涉的实相了吗？这么做和执迷不悟地执着于一个指示牌、和一个心理偶像有什么差别？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The reverse also applies: If, for whatever reason, you disliked the word honey, that might prevent you from ever tasting it. If you had a strong aversion to the word God, which is a negative form of attachment, you may be denying not just the word but also the reality to which it points. You would be cutting yourself off from the possibility of experiencing that reality. All this is, of course, intrinsically connected with being identified with your mind.</p><p>反过来也是同样的道理：如果你，不管基于什么理由，就是讨厌蜂蜜这个字。或许就会阻止你进一步地去品尝它。如果你对神这个字有一股强烈的反感，这是执着的负面形式。你否定的也许不只是神这个字，甚至连它所指涉的实相也一起否定了。你无异断绝了自己体验这个实相的可能性。这一切当然与你的心智认同密不可分了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>So, if a word doesn't work for you anymore, then drop it and replace it with one that does work. If you don't like the word sin, then call it unconsciousness or insanity. That may get you closer to the truth, the reality behind the word, than a long-misused word like sin, and leaves little room for guilt.</p><p>所以，如果一个字已经对你起不了作用，就把它丢了，换一个对你起作用的字。如果你不喜欢罪恶这个字，就把它叫做无意识或疯狂好了。如此一来，就比方像罪恶等被误用已久的文字，也许更让你接近真理，更接近文字背后的实相，而少生愧疚之嫌了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I don't like those words either. They imply that there is something wrong with me. I am being judged.</p><p>我也不喜欢那些字。它们暗示着我有什么地方不对劲，暗示着我被人批判。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Of course there is something wrong with you — and you are not being judged.</p><p>你当然不对劲了——不过没人批判你。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I don't mean to offend you personally, but do you not belong to the human race that has killed over mo million members of their own species in the twentieth century alone?</p><p>我没有针对你个人的意思。难道你不属于这个在二十世纪之内，就屠杀了上亿人口的人类吗？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>You mean guilt by association?</p><p>你是说连坐罪？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It is not a question of guilt. But as long as you are run by the egoic mind, you are part of the collective insanity. Perhaps you haven't looked very deeply into the human condition in its state of dominance by the egoic mind. Open your eyes and see the fear, the despair, the greed, and the violence that are all-pervasive. See the heinous cruelty and suffering on an unimaginable scale that humans have inflicted and continue to inflict on each other as well as on other life forms on the planet. You don't need to condemn. Just observe. That is sin. That is insanity. That is unconsciousness. Above all, don't forget to observe your own mind. Seek out the root of the insanity there.</p><p>这不是罪不罪的问题。可是只要你被我执的心智掌控一天，你就是人类集体丧心病狂的一份子。也许你还没有很深入地看过人类在心智主导下的现状。张开眼睛，看看那些所不在的恐惧、绝望、贪婪、和暴力。看看那些人类对彼此、对地球上的众生，一直持续地在无远弗届的层面上，所造成令人发指的暴行虐施和苦难。你不需要谴责。只要观察。这就是罪恶。这就是丧心病狂。这就是无意识。最重要的，不要忘记观察你自己的心智。在你里面挖出丧心病狂的根源。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>FINDING YOUR INVISIBLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE REALITY</p><p>找到你无形且不灭的实相</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>You said that identification with our physical form is part of the illusion, so how can the body, the physical form, bring you to a realization of Being?</p><p>你说形体认同是幻相的一部份。那么肉身，就是形体，要如何体现本体（存在）？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The body that you can see and touch cannot take you into Being. But that visible and tangible body is only an outer shell, or rather a limited and distorted perception of a deeper reality. In your natural state of connectedness with Being, this deeper reality can be felt every moment as the invisible inner body, the animating presence within you. So to "inhabit the body" is to feel the body from within, to feel the life inside the body and thereby come to know that you are beyond the outer form.</p><p>你可见、可触的身体，无法把你带入本体（存在）。可是，这一个有形和有觉的肉身，却只是一具躯壳。或者说，是对一个更深层实相的有限且曲解的感知。在你与本体（存在）连系时的自然状态下，这个深层的实相，就能以一个无形的内在身体——你内在那个鲜活的临在——随时随地的被觉受到。所以“进驻身体”，就是从内在去感觉你的身体，感觉身体里面的生命，从而知道你是超越外相的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>But that is only the beginning of an inward journey that will take you ever more deeply into a realm of great stillness and peace, yet also of great power and vibrant life. At first, you may only get fleeting glimpses of it, but through them you will begin to realize that you are not just a meaningless fragment in an alien universe, briefly suspended between birth and death, allowed a few short-lived pleasures followed by pain and ultimate annihilation. Underneath your outer form, you are connected with something so vast, so immeasurable and sacred, that it cannot be conceived or spoken of — yet I am speaking of it now. I am speaking of it not to give you something to believe in but to show you how you can know it for yourself.</p><p>不过这只是你内在之旅的起点。由此你将进一步深入一个无比宁静、和平，却又充满力量和活力的领域。一开始你也许只是偶而瞥见这个陌生的宇宙。可是透过这些瞥见，你会逐渐体会到，自己不再是这个内在宇宙里毫无意义的碎片，一个在生死之间，短暂地羁留在片刻享乐之后，承受着痛苦和彻底虚无的碎片。在你的形体之内，与某一个无以理解，无法言传的浩瀚、无量又神圣之物连系着。虽然无法言传——我还是在谈论它。我的话不是要给你一个可以相信的事物，而是要向你显示，你可以凭着自己知道它。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>You are cut off from Being as long as your mind takes up all your attention. When this happens — and it happens continuously for most people — you are not in your body. The mind absorbs all your consciousness and transforms it into mind stuff. You cannot stop thinking. Compulsive thinking has become a collective disease. Your whole sense of who you are is then derived from mind activity. Your identity, as it is no longer rooted in Being, becomes a vulnerable and ever-needy mental construct, which creates fear as the predominant underlying emotion. The one thing that truly matters is then missing from your life: awareness of your deeper self your invisible and indestructible reality.</p><p>当你的心智占据了你所有的专注时，你便与本体（存在）断绝了连系。这种情形发生的时候（多数人经常如此），你就不在你的身体里。心智吸走了你所有的意识，把它转型成心智的材料。你无法停止思考。强迫性的思考已经变成了集体性疾病。你对于自己是谁的整个认知，都来自于心智的活动。你的身份认同已经不再根植在本体（存在）了，它变成了一个脆弱而需求不止的心理结构，继而创造了成为情绪主导的恐惧。你生命中真正重要的一样东西：深层自我的觉知——你无形且不灭的实相便消失不见了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>To become conscious of Being, you need to reclaim consciousness from the mind. This is one of the most essential tasks on your spiritual journey. It will free vast amounts of consciousness that previously had been trapped in useless and compulsive thinking. A very effective way of doing this is simply to take the focus of your attention away from thinking and direct it into the body, where Being can be felt in the first instance as the invisible energy field that gives life to what you perceive as the physical body.</p><p>要对本体（存在）觉知之前，你需要把心智里的意识收回。这是你的灵性之旅中，最根本的一个任务。这个任务会把先前被困在无益的和强迫性的思考中，大量的意识释放出来。一个极为有效的方法就是：单纯地把注意力的焦点从思考上移开，而导入你的身体里。在这里，你立刻就可以感受到那个以无形的磁场，赋予肉体生命的本体（存在）了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>CONNECTING WITH THE INNER BODY</p><p>和内在身体连系</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Please try it now. You may find it helpful to close your eyes for this practice. Later on, when "being in the body" has become natural and easy, this will no longer be necessary. Direct your attention into the body. Feel it from within. Is it alive? Is there life in your hands, arms, legs, and feet — in your abdomen, your chest? Can you feel the subtle energy field that pervades the entire body and gives vibrant life to every organ and every cell? Can you feel it simultaneously in all parts of the body as a single field of energy? Keep focusing on the feeling of your inner body for a few moments. Do not start to think about it. Feel it. The more attention you give it, the clearer and stronger this feeling will become. It will feel as if every cell is becoming more alive, and if you have a strong visual sense, you may get an image of your body becoming luminous. Although such an image can help you temporarily, pay more attention to the feeling than to any image that may arise. An image, no matter how beautiful or powerful, is already defined in form, so there is less scope for penetrating more deeply.</p><p>请你现在就试。你也许觉得闭上眼睛练习比较有用。等过一段时间，“在身体里”变得比较自然、比较轻松的时候就不需要了。把你的专注导入你身体里。从里面感觉它。它是活的吗？你的双手、手臂、腿和脚——你的腹部、你的胸腔里有生命吗？你能感受到在你身体里赋予每一个器官和细胞跃动的生命，和无所不在的微妙能场吗？你能感受到那个同步地存在于你身体里每一个部位的单一能场吗？用几分钟的时间，专注在你内在身体的觉受上。不要想。感觉它。你付出给它的关注越多，这个觉受就会越清楚、越强烈。你会感觉好像每一个细胞都变得更加活跃。如果你天生就有敏锐的视觉，也许你可以观想自己变得通体透明。虽然观想可以暂时地帮助你，不过还是把重点摆在觉受上，而不要太在意可能出现的图像。再漂亮、再有能量的图像，先天上已经被形相所限定了，也因此限制了你无法做更深入的探索。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and unfathomable. You can always go into it more deeply. If you cannot feel very much at this stage, pay attention to whatever you can feel. Perhaps there is just a slight tingling in your hands or feet. That's good enough for the moment. Just focus on the feeling. Your body is coming alive. Later, we will practice some more. Please open your eyes now, but keep some attention in the inner energy field of the body even as you look around the room. The inner body lies at the threshold between your form identity and your essence identity, your true nature. Never lose touch with it.</p><p>你内在身体的感觉是无形、无限、而且不可蠡测的。你随时都可以更深入地探索。如果你现阶段感觉不到什么，那么就关注在你能够感受到的。或许你的手、脚只有轻微的酥麻。这就够了。专注在这个感受上。你的身体正在复活。以后我们再多加练习。请睁开眼睛。即使你环顾房间的同时，也要保留部分的注意力在你内在的能场上。你的内在身体，位于你的形相身份通往本质身份——你的真性——的门槛。千万不要失去跟它的连系。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>TRANSFORMATION THROUGH THE BODY</p><p>透过身体进行转化</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Why have most religions condemned or denied the body? It seems that spiritual seekers have always regarded the body as a hindrance or even as sinful.</p><p>为什么多数宗教都谴责或否定身体？灵修者好像都把身体当做一个障碍，甚至是罪恶的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Why have so few seekers become finders?</p><p>为什么求道的人多，得道的人少？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>On the level of the body, humans are very dose to animals. All the basic bodily functions — pleasure, pain, breathing, eating, drinking, defecating, sleeping, the drive to find a mate and procreate, and of course birth and death — we share with the animals. A long time after their fall from a state of grace and oneness into illusion, humans suddenly woke up in what seemed to be an animal body — and they found this very disturbing. "Don't fool yourself. You are no more than an animal." This seemed to be the truth that was staring them in the face. But it was too disturbing a truth to tolerate. Adam and Eve saw that they were naked, and they became afraid. Unconscious denial of their animal nature set in very quickly. The threat that they might be taken over by powerful instinctual drives and revert back to complete unconsciousness was indeed a very real one. Shame and taboos appeared around certain parts of the body and bodily functions, especially sexuality. The light of their consciousness was not yet strong enough to make friends with their animal nature, to allow it to be and even enjoy that aspect of themselves — let alone to go deeply into it to find the divine hidden within it, the reality within the illusion. So they did what they had to do. They began to disassociate from their body. They now saw themselves as having a body, rather than just being it.</p><p>人类在身体的层面上，和动物所差无几。所有基本的生理作用——享乐、痛苦、呼吸、吃、喝、拉、撒、睡、求偶、繁殖，当然还包括了生与死——我们都和动物一致。人类从恩典和合一的状态中，堕落至幻相里很长一段时间之后，突然间从一具恍似动物的身体里醒来。这使得人类深感困扰，“不要唬弄自己了。你不过是只动物罢了。”这句话像是毫不留情面的一个事实。可是它是这么令人困扰、又令人难以下咽的事实。亚当和夏娃看到自己赤裸的身体，不由得害怕了。无意识对他们动物本能的否定趁虚而入。他们可能被强大的本能驱力所掌控，而退转回完全无意识的威胁变的非常真实。羞耻和禁忌便出现在身体的某些部分和功能上，其中以性欲为大。他们的意识之光还没有亮到可以让他们和自己的动物本能握手言欢的地步。也还不到让他们容许它存在，甚至于安住在这个层面的地步——更遑论深入它，找出隐藏其中的神性，找出幻相里的实相了。因此，在毫无选择的情况下，他们切断了和身体的连系。现在他们认为自己拥有一具身体，而不是他们的身体。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>When religions arose, this disassociation became even more pronounced as the "you are not your body" belief. Countless people in East and West throughout the ages have tried to find God, salvation, or enlightenment through denial of the body. This took the form of denial of sense pleasures and of sexuality in particular, fasting, and other ascetic practices. They even inflicted pain on the body in an attempt to weaken or punish it because they regarded it as sinful. In Christianity, this used to be called mortification of the flesh. Others tried to escape from the body by entering trance states or seeking out-of-the-body experiences. Many still do. Even the Buddha is said to have practiced body denial through fasting and extreme forms of asceticism for six years, but he did not attain enlightenment until after he had given up this practice.</p><p>宗教兴起之后，这种人、身的分离，变成了公然的“你不是你的身体”的信念。于是东西社会，跨越所有年龄层，无以数计的人们，开始透过对身体的否定来寻找神、寻找救赎或悟道。这种态度以各种形式呈现，禁绝感官的享乐，特别是性欲的禁绝，还有禁食和其他的苦修。甚至不惜施加痛苦，企图削弱或惩罚自己的身体，因为身体在他们眼里是罪恶的东西。基督教称为禁欲。其他宗教则透过入定或灵魂出体经验来逃避身体。至今还有许多人这么做。即使是佛陀也曾历经禁食和六年严苛的苦修，以达到弃绝身体的目的。最后还是在放弃苦修之后才开悟的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The fact is that no one has ever become enlightened through denying or fighting the body or through an out-of-the-body experience. Although such an experience can be fascinating and can give you a glimpse of the state of liberation from the material form, in the end you will always have to return to the body, where the essential work of transformation takes place. Transformation is through the body, not away from it. This is why no true master has ever advocated fighting or leaving the body, although their mind-based followers often have.</p><p>事实上，从来没有一个人透过弃绝身体或对抗身体、或者凭着出体经验而开悟的。虽然这一类经验著实令人神往，也会让人瞥见由物质界解脱的境地。你终究还是要回归到根本转化的发源地——身体上去。转化要透过你的身体，不是远离你的身体。这也是为什么真正的师父，从来不主张对抗身体或弃绝身体的原因。虽然那些以心智为根器的追随者经常这么做。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Of the ancient teachings concerning the body, only certain fragments survive, such as Jesus's statement that "your whole body will be filled with light," or they survive as myths, such as the belief that Jesus never relinquished his body but remained one with it and ascended into "heaven" with it. Almost no one to this day has understood those fragments or the hidden meaning of certain myths, and the "you are not your body" belief has prevailed universally, leading to body denial and attempts to escape from the body. Countless seekers have thus been prevented from attaining spiritual realization for themselves and becoming finders.</p><p>古老的教诲中，凡是涉及到身体的只剩下断简残篇。其中如耶稣曾经宣称的“你整个身体都将充满光。”或者藏诸名山沦为神话，比如传说中耶稣一直没有抛弃他的身体，而是和他的身体一起升入“天国”。当今之世，几乎没有人了解这些断简残篇或神话里的密意。“你不是你的身体”的信念盛行一时，因而导致了身体的弃绝和逃避身体的企图。无数的求道者因而在灵性的实现上受阻，而无法成为得道者。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Is it possible to recover the lost teachings on the significance of the body or to reconstruct them from the existing fragments?</p><p>我们有可能找回失落的古训，或者自断简残篇中将之重建？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>There is no need for that. All spiritual teachings originate from the same Source. In that sense, there is and always has been only one master, who manifests in many different forms. I am that master, and so are you, once you are able to access the Source within. And the way to it is through the inner body. Although all spiritual teachings originate from the same Source, once they become verbalized and written down they are obviously no more than collections of words — and a word is nothing but a signpost, as we talked about earlier. All such teachings are signposts pointing the way back to the Source.</p><p>不需要这么做。所有灵性教诲都来自同一个源头。从这个意义来看，自始至终就只有一位师父。他以诸多的形相显化出来。我是这位师父。一旦你能取得这个内在的源头之后，你也是这位师父。而取得之道就是你内在的身体。虽然所有的古训都来自同一个本源，只要一形之于声、化之为书，便成了文字的堆砌。但文字充其量只是一个指示牌，这一点我们在前面谈过。所有古训都是指往回归源头的路标。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I have already spoken of the Truth that is hidden within your body, but I will summarize for you again the lost teachings of the masters — so here is another signpost. Please endeavor to feel your inner body as you read or listen.</p><p>我已经谈过隐藏在你身体里的真理。不过我想再为你把大师们失落的古训，做一个总结——你又多了一面路标了。请你在读这本书的同时，刻意地去感受你的内在身体。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>SERMON ON THE BODY</p><p>身体实训</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>What you perceive as a dense physical structure called the body, which is subject to disease, old age, and death, is not ultimately real — is not you. It is a misperception of your essential reality that is beyond birth and death, and is due to the limitations of your mind, which, having lost touch with Being, creates the body as evidence of its illusory belief in separation and to justify its state of fear. But do not turn away from the body, for within that symbol of impermanence, limitation, and death that you perceive as the illusory creation of your mind is concealed the splendor of your essential and immortal reality. Do not turn your attention elsewhere in your search for the Truth, for it is nowhere else to be found but within your body.</p><p>你所感知的那个高密度的实体结构，那个难免于生、老、病、死的身体，并不究竟——它不是你。它是你对超越生死的本质实相的错误感知。这归因于它与本体（存在）失去连系后，所产生的心智局限，继而创造出身体做为它孤离信念的证据，并且藉着身体把它的恐惧状态合理化。不过，不要因此弃你的身体于不顾。因为在这个心智所创造的幻相里，在这个无常、有限和死亡的象征里，隐含着你本质的和不朽实相的光辉。不要向你的身外觅求真理，因为真理就在你的身体里面，此外无处可觅。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Do not fight against the body, for in doing so you are fighting against your own reality. You are your body. The body that you can see and touch is only a thin illusory veil. Underneath it lies the invisible inner body, the doorway into Being, into Life Unmanifested. Through the inner body, you are inseparably connected to this unmanifested One Life — birthless, deathless, eternally present. Through the inner body, you are forever one with God.</p><p>不要和你的身体对抗，因为这么做无异对抗你自己的实相。你就是你的身体。你那可见、可触的身体，只是一层虚幻的薄幕。它的底层有一个无形的内在身体，是通往本体（存在），进入隐含生命的门径。透过了你的内在身体，你便与这个隐含的至一生命——无生亦无死的永恒临在取得了不可断离的连系。透过内在身体，你与神永远合一。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>§</p><p>∽</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>HAVE DEEP ROOTS WITHIN</p><p>往内扎根</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The key is to be in a state of permanent connectedness with your inner body — to feel it at all times. This will rapidly deepen and transform your life. The more consciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its vibrational frequency becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you turn up the dimmer switch and so increase the flow of electricity. At this higher energy level, negativity cannot affect you anymore, and you tend to attract new circumstances that reflect this higher frequency.</p><p>关键在于和你的内在身体取得恒常的连系——随时随地去感觉它。你的生命会因此而快速加深和转化。你导入内在身体的意识越多，它的波动就越高。这很像转动调光开关，增加电流使灯光更亮一样。在这样的高能量的层面，负面的情感再也无法影响你了。而你也更加容易吸引能反射这个高能场的环境。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>If you keep your attention in the body as much as possible, you will be anchored in the Now. You won't lose yourself in the external world, and you won't lose yourself in your mind. Thoughts and emotions, fears and desires, may still be there to some extent, but they won't take you over.</p><p>如果你尽可能地关注在身体上，你就会把自己锚定在当下。既不会在外境里迷失自己；也不会迷失在心智的迷宫里。某个程度的思想和情感、恐惧和欲望还在，却不再掌控你了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Please examine where your attention is at this moment. You are listening to me, or you are reading these words in a book. That is the focus of your attention. You are also peripherally aware of your surroundings, other people, and so on. Furthermore, there may be some mind activity around what you are hearing or reading, some mental commentary. Yet there is no need for any of this to absorb all your attention. See if you can be in touch with your inner body at the same time. Keep some of your attention within. Don't let it all flow out. Feel your whole body from within, as a single field of energy. It is almost as if you were listening or reading with your whole body. Let this be your practice in the days and weeks to come.</p><p>请你检视一下，你这一刻的关注在哪里。你是在倾听我说的话，还是在阅读书里的文字。这就是你关注的焦点。你同时也概略地觉知到你处身的环境、和其他的人等等。另外，在你倾听或阅读的行为里，还附带了一些心智活动——一些心理评论。可是你不需要让这些干扰，吸走你所有的关注。试试看你能否在同时间与你的内在身体取得连系。保留一部分在里面。不要让它外泄。从内在，把你整个身体当做一个单一的能场来感觉。就好像你在用你整副身体倾听或阅读一样。以后的这几天、几星期里就做这个练习吧。（回家功课！）</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Do not give all your attention away to the mind and the external world. By all means focus on what you are doing, but feel the inner body at the same time whenever possible. Stay rooted within. Then observe how this changes your state of consciousness and the quality of what you are doing.</p><p>不要把你全部的关注交给心智和外境。不计一切地专注你手头上的工作。不过要在尽可能的情况下，感觉你的内在身体，向内扎根。然后再观测它是如何改变了你的意识状态和工作的品质。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Whenever you are waiting, wherever it may be, use that time to feel the inner body. In this way, traffic jams and line-ups become very enjoyable. Instead of mentally projecting yourself away from the Now, go more deeply into the Now by going more deeply into the body.</p><p>当你在等候的时候，不管你等的是什么，利用这段时间感觉你的内在身体。这种方式可以把塞车和排队变成一件乐事。避免在当下之外，投射你的心智。藉着深入你的内在身体，而深入当下。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The art of inner-body awareness will develop into a completely new way of living, a state of permanent connectedness with Being, and will add a depth to your life that you have never known before.</p><p>熟练了内在身体的觉知艺术之后，你就能发展出一个崭新的生活方式：一个与本体连系的恒常状态。为你的生命增加了前所未知的纵深。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It is easy to stay present as the observer of your mind when you are deeply rooted within your body. No matter what happens on the outside, nothing can shake you anymore.</p><p>当你根植在你身体的内在之后，你会很容易地以心智观测者的身份保持临在了。不管外在发生什么，你还是如如不动。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Unless you stay present — and inhabiting your body is always an essential aspect of it — you will continue to be run by your mind. The script in your head that you learned a long time ago, the conditioning of your mind, will dictate your thinking and your behavior. You may be free of it for brief intervals, but rarely for long. This is especially true when something "goes wrong" or there is some loss or upset. Your conditioned reaction will then be involuntary, automatic, and predictable, fueled by the one basic emotion that underlies the mind-identified state of consciousness: fear.</p><p>除非你保持临在（进驻身体里是它的基本功夫），你的心智会继续地掌控你。你脑海里习染多年的剧码、你心智的制约，就会支配着你的思考和行为。你也许间歇地摆脱了它，却鲜少持久的。这种情形特别发生在事情“出错了”、遭受失落、或不如意的时候。你制约的反应，在这时候变得不自主、自动化，而且可预期，你会因此而得到主导心智认同意识状态的基本情感：恐惧的滋养。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>So when such challenges come, as they always do, make it a habit to go within at once and focus as much as you can on the inner energy field of your body. This need not take long, just a few seconds. But you need to do it the moment that the challenge presents itself. Any delay will allow a conditioned mental-emotional reaction to arise and take you over. When you focus within and feel the inner body, you immediately become still and present as you are withdrawing consciousness from the mind. If a response is required in that situation, it will come up from this deeper level. Just as the sun is infinitely brighter than a candle flame, there is infinitely more intelligence in Being than in your mind.</p><p>当这种挑战来临的时候——这是常情——你要习惯性地立刻进入内在，并且尽你所能地专注在内在身体的能场上。整个过程只有短短的几秒钟而已。不过你需要在挑战出现的当时就这么做。稍有迟滞，一个制约了的心理情感反应，就会趁虚而入接管你了。当你专注于内在，感觉你内在的身体时，你会在意识从心智撤离的同时，立刻变得宁静和临在。如果那个情境需要你做反应，你的反应会来自这一个更深的层面。你本体里面的无上智慧就像阳光一样，胜过心智的烛火不知凡几。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>As long as you are in conscious contact with your inner body, you are like a tree that is deeply rooted in the earth, or a building with a deep and solid foundation. The latter analogy is used by Jesus in the generally misunderstood parable of the two men who build a house. One man builds it on the sand, without a foundation, and when the storms and floods come, the house is swept away. The other man digs deep until he reaches the rock, then builds his house, which is not swept away by the floods.</p><p>每当你有意识地与内在身体连系的时候，你就好比一棵扎根在大地的树木，或是一栋根基稳固的建筑一样。这个盖房子的比喻，耶稣曾经用过。可惜这个寓言却广遭误解。他说有两个人都在盖房子。其中一人盖在没有地基的沙上，房子在暴风洪水的侵袭下垮了。另外一个人却把地基凿深进入表土之下的磐石上，因此历经洪水的冲袭而屹立不摇。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>BEFORE YOU ENTER THE BODY, FORGIVE</p><p>进驻身体前，先宽恕</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I felt very uncomfortable when I tried to put my attention on the inner body. There was a feeling of agitation and some nausea. So I haven't been able to experience what you are talking about.</p><p>我尝试着关注内在身体的时候，觉得很不舒服。我有一种恼怒和反胃的感觉。你所说的我都没办法体验到。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>What you felt was a lingering emotion that you were probably unaware of, until you started putting some attention into the body. Unless you first give it some attention, the emotion will prevent you from gaining access to the inner body, which lies at a deeper level underneath it. Attention does not mean that you start thinking about it. It means to just observe the emotion, to feel it fully, and so to acknowledge and accept it as it is. Some emotions are easily identified: anger, fear, grief, and so on. Others may be much harder to label. They may just be vague feelings of unease, heaviness, or constriction, halfway between an emotion and a physical sensation. In any case, what matters is not whether you can attach a mental label to it but whether you can bring the feeling of it into awareness as much as possible. Attention is the key to transformation — and full attention also implies acceptance. Attention is like a beam of light — the focused power of your consciousness that transmutes everything into itself.</p><p>在你开始把一部分的专注摆在身体里面之前，你感受到的可能是一个你觉察不到的情绪滞留（累积的负面情绪）。除非你先给它一些关注，否则它就会阻挡你进入内在身体的通道。这个通道就在情绪的下一个层面。关注不是开始去思考它的意思。它的意思是单纯地观测这个情绪，透彻地感觉它，如此一来你就是照它本然的样子承认它、接受它了。我们最容易辨识的一些情绪是：愤怒、恐惧、悲伤等。其他的也许比较难以标示。也许只是介于情绪和生理知觉之间，模糊的不安感、沉重感、或拘束感。无论是哪一种情况，重要的不在于你是否能给它一个心理标签，而在于你能否尽你所能地把它的感受带到觉知里。关注是转化的关键——全然的关注就隐含着接纳的意思。专注就好像一道光束——它是把一切转型为本然的意识焦聚力。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>In a fully functional organism, an emotion has a very short life span. It is like a momentary ripple or wave on the surface of your Being. When you are not in your body, however, an emotion can survive inside you for days or weeks, or join with other emotions of a similar frequency that have merged and become the pain-body, a parasite that can live inside you for years, feed on your energy, lead to physical illness, and make your life miserable.</p><p>在一个全面运作的有机体里面，一个情绪的存活期很短。它就好像本体上的一个涟漪或水波。当你不驻守在身体里的时候，它的残存期就会延长至数日或数星期之久，或者与其他相同频率的情绪并联，而变成痛苦之身。痛苦之身经年累月地寄生在你的内在，蚕食你的能量，导致生理疾病，让你的生命悲惨不已。（参见第二章）</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>So place your attention on feeling the emotion, and check whether your mind is holding on to a grievance pattern such as blame, self-pity, or resentment that is feeding the emotion. If that is the case, it means that you haven't forgiven. Nonforgiveness is often toward another person or yourself, but it may just as well be toward any situation or condition — past, present or future — that your mind refuses to accept. Yes, there can be nonforgiveness even with regard to the future. This is the mind's refusal to accept uncertainty, to accept that the future is ultimately beyond its control. Forgiveness is to relinquish your grievance and so to let go of grief. It happens naturally once you realize that your grievance serves no purpose except to strengthen a false sense of self. Forgiveness is to offer no resistance to life — to allow life to live through you. The alternatives are pain and suffering, a greatly restricted flow of life energy, and in many cases physical disease.</p><p>因此，把你的关注摆在情绪的觉受上。并且检查你的心智是否执着在一个怨怼的模式里，比如饲养这个情绪的谴责、自怜、或怨恨。如果是这种情况，表示你还没有宽恕。不宽恕通常是针对另一个人或你自己而发的。不过也可能是对一个情境或情状——过去、现在或未来是你心智所拒绝接受的。没错，甚至对未来都可能会产生不宽恕。这是因为心智拒绝接受未来的不确定性，不接受未来是彻底超越它所控制的。宽恕就是抛弃你的怨怼，因而放下了悲伤。一旦你体会出怨怼除了强化你虚假的自我之外一无用处的时候，宽恕就会自然地发生了。宽恕就是对生命不做抗拒——容许生命透过你而展现。除此之外你只剩一条路可走，就是痛和受苦，或是生命能量的停滞受困，还有许多生理疾病的案例。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The moment you truly forgive, you have reclaimed your power from the mind. Nonforgiveness is the very nature of the mind, just as the mind-made false self, the ego, cannot survive without strife and conflict. The mind cannot forgive. Only you can. You become present, you enter your body, you feel the vibrant peace and stillness that emanate from Being. That is why Jesus said: "Before you enter the temple, forgive."</p><p>在你真正宽恕的那一刻，你就从心智那里收回了你的力量。不宽恕是心智的本性。就像心造的假我，我执一样，没有冲突和对峙就无法存活。心智不能宽恕，只有你能。你变得临在。你进入了你的身体。你感觉到本体放射出灿烂的和平和宁静。这也是耶稣说，“进入庙堂之前先宽恕”的原因。</p></div>

<div class='layout'><p>What is the relationship between presence and the inner body?</p><p>临在和内在身体的关系如何？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Presence is pure consciousness — consciousness that has been reclaimed from the mind, from the world of form. The inner body is your link with the Unmanifested, and in its deepest aspect is the Unmanifested: the Source from which consciousness emanates as light emanates from the sun. Awareness of the inner body is consciousness remembering its origin and returning to the Source.</p><p>临在就是纯意识——从心智和形相界收回的意识。内在身体是你和初始混沌（unmanifested未被显化的）的接环。在最深的层面来说，它就是初始混沌：放射意识的源头；就像放射阳光的太阳一样。内在身体的觉知，就是意识记得了它的源出，回到了源头。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Is the Unmanifested the same as Being?</p><p>初始混沌和本体（存在）一样吗？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Yes. The word Unmanifested attempts, by way of negation, to express That which cannot be spoken, thought or imagined. It points to what it is by saying what it is not. Being, on the other hand, is a positive term. Please don't get attached to either of these words or start believing in them. They are no more than signposts.</p><p>一样。初始混沌这个词，试图透过否定（un），来表达不可说、不可思、不可想的那个。它藉着说出它不是，而指出它是。本体却是一个正面的名词。请你不要执着在这两个词上，或者开始相信它们。它们只不过是指标。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>You said that presence is consciousness that has been reclaimed from the mind. Who does the reclaiming?</p><p>你说临在就是从心智那里收回的意识。收回意识的是谁？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>You do. But since in your essence you are consciousness, we might as well say that it is an awakening of consciousness from the dream of form. This does not mean that your own form will instantly vanish in an explosion of light. You can continue in your present form yet be aware of the formless and deathless deep within you.</p><p>是你。可是由于你在本质里就是意识，所以也可以说是意识从形式的梦里醒了。这并不表示你自己的形式一曝光就消失。你可以持续在你目前的形式里，却觉知了你内在无形和不灭的深处。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I must admit that this is way beyond my comprehension, and yet on some deeper level I seem to know what you are talking about. It's more like a feeling than anything else. Am I deceiving myself?</p><p>我必须要承认这远超过我的理解。可是在某个更深的层面，我似乎又懂你的意思。比较像一种感受。我是不是在自欺？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>No, you are not. Feeling will get you closer to the truth of who you are than thinking. I cannot tell you anything that deep within you don't already know. When you have reached a certain stage of inner connectedness, you recognize the truth when you hear it. If you haven't reached that stage yet, the practice of body awareness will bring about the deepening that is necessary.</p><p>不，你没有自欺。感受比思考更能让你接近你是谁的真理。我所告诉你的没有一样不是你内在深处已经知道了的。当你达到某一阶段的内在连系时，你一听到真理就可以辨识它。如果你尚未达到这个阶段，做身体觉知练习会促发必要的纵深。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>SLOWING DOWN THE AGING PROCESS</p><p>延缓老化过程</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>In the meantime, awareness of the inner body has other benefits in the physical realm. One of them is a significant slowing down of the aging of the physical body.</p><p>内在身体的觉知，还会带来生理方面的好处。其中之一就是：相当程度地延缓了身体的老化。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Whereas the outer body normally appears to grow old and wither fairly quickly, the inner body does not change with time, except that you may feel it more deeply and become it more fully. If you are twenty years old now, the energy field of your inner body will feel just the same when you are eighty. It will be just as vibrantly alive. As soon as your habitual state changes from being out-of-the-body and trapped in your mind to being in-the-body and present in the Now, your physical body will feel lighter, clearer, more alive. As there is more consciousness in the body, its molecular structure actually becomes less dense. More consciousness means a lessening of the illusion of materiality.</p><p>正常状况下，外在身体老化和枯萎的速度很快。内在身体却不会随着时间而改变，你反而会随着时间更深入地感觉它，更充分地变成它。如果你现在二十岁，等你八十岁的时候，你内在身体的能场感觉还是一样。它的生命力还是一样旺盛。当你由习以为常的不驻体和困于心智的状态中，改变成驻体和临在当下的状态，你的身体会感觉更轻快、更清爽、更有活力。这是因为身体里的意识增多，而它的分子结构的密度实际上已经变得更低的缘故。意识增多意谓着物界幻相的减少。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>When you become identified more with the timeless inner body than with the outer body, when presence becomes your normal mode of consciousness and past and future no longer dominate your attention, you do not accumulate time anymore in your psyche and in the cells of the body. The accumulation of time as the psychological burden of past and future greatly impairs the cells' capacity for self-renewal. So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow old at a much slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless essence will shine through the outer form, and you will not give the appearance of an old person.</p><p>当你对无时间性的内在身体的认同，多过于外在身体时，当临在变成你意识的常态时，过去和未来不能再主宰你的注意力时，你就不会在心灵和细胞里累积时间了。累积时间形成了一个心理负荷，严重地损伤了细胞的再生能力。因此如果你进驻了内在身体，外在身体的老化就会减缓。甚至在身体老化的时候，你那个超越时间的本质，也会透过外形发光，使你不会给人老态龙钟的外貌。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Is there any scientific evidence for this?</p><p>这个说法有科学证据吗？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Try it out and you will be the evidence.</p><p>试试看，你就是证据。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>STRENGTHENING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</p><p>强化你的免疫系统</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Another benefit of this practice in the physical realm is a great strengthening of the immune system which occurs when you inhabit the body. The more consciousness you bring into the body, the stronger the immune system becomes. It is as if every cell awakens and rejoices. The body loves your attention. It is also a potent form of self-healing. Most illnesses creep in when you are not present in the body. If the master is not present in the house, all kinds of shady characters will take up residence there. When you inhabit your body, it will be hard for unwanted guests to enter.</p><p>这个练习在生理上的另一个好处就是：当你进驻身体之后，你的免疫系统会增强。你带进身体里的意识越多，免疫系统就会越强。就好像每一个细胞都醒过来庆祝一样。身体爱你的关注。这也是一种深具潜力的自疗法。多数疾病都是在你不临在身体的时候趁虚而入的。主人不在家的时候，三教九流的闲杂人等就会鸠占鹊巢。当你进驻了自己的身体，不速之客就很难私闯。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It is not only your physical immune system that becomes strengthened; your psychic immune system is greatly enhanced as well. The latter protects you from the negative mental-emotional force fields of others, which are highly contagious. Inhabiting the body protects you not by putting up a shield, but by raising the frequency vibration of your total energy field, so that anything that vibrates at a lower frequency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists in what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesn't enter your field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don't need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right through you. Please don't just accept or reject what I am saying. Put it to the test.</p><p>被强化了的还不只是你的生理免疫系统；你心灵的免疫系统也大为增强。后者可以保护你免于别人具高度传染性的负面心理-情绪的波及。进驻身体并不是架设一个盾甲来保护你；而是提高你整体能场的频率。让那些低频率的情绪如：恐惧、愤怒、沮丧等，只存在于一个不同序列的虚拟实相里，而不能再进入你的意识场了。即使进来，你也不需要做任何抗拒，因为它会穿越你而去。请你不要一谓地接受或拒绝我的说法。亲身做个测试。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever you feel the need to boost your immune system. It is particularly effective if used when you feel the first symptoms of an illness, but it also works with illnesses that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals and with an intense focus. It will also counteract any disruption of your energy field by some form of negativity. However, it is not a substitute for the moment-to-moment practice of being in the body;, otherwise, its effect will only be temporary. Here it is.</p><p>每当你需要提升免疫系统的时候，不妨做一个简单却有强效的自疗式冥想。在你感觉到生病的初期症候时，做这个练习特别有效。如果你用深刻的专注，经常做定时的练习，对已经罹患的疾病也有疗效。它也会抵消任何阻断你能场的负面情绪。然而它不能取代进驻身体的不间断式练习；否则它就只有短暂的效果了。练习如下：</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at night before falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, "flood" your body with consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose different parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, from feet to head and back again. This need only take a minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that time, present in every cell of your body. Don't be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds in drawing your attention out of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. As soon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attention to the inner body.</p><p>当你有几分钟空档的时候，特别是晚上人睡前或早上起床前的时间。用意识“注满”你的身体。闭上眼。平躺下来。一开始先选择身体的不同部位，短暂地把注意力集中在上面：手、脚、手臂、腿、腹部、胸部、头部等，尽可能深刻地感觉这些部位的能量。在每一个部位停留约十五秒钟左右，然后让你的注意力像波浪一样穿越全身，从脚到头来回做几遍。这个过程只要几分钟的时间。做完之后，再把内在身体当做一个单一的能场来感觉它。稳住这个感觉几分钟的时间。在这段时间内要深刻地临在，在你每一个细胞里临在。如果、心智偶而把你的注意力从身体上拉走，让你在思想里迷失的话，不用担心。你一察觉这种情况发生的时候，只要把注意力再拉回你内在的身体就好。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>LET THE BREATH TAKE YOU INTO THE BODY</p><p>让呼吸为你导航</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>At times, when my mind has been very active, it has acquired such momentum that I find it impossible to take my attention away from it and feel the inner body. This happens particularly when I get into a worry or anxiety pattern. Do you have any suggestions?</p><p>有时候我的心智非常活跃。它取得了相当大的动能，我发觉我没办法把注意力拉开，去感觉内在身体。这种情况特别会出现在我进入担忧或焦虑模式里的时候。你有什么建议吗？</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>If at any time you are finding it hard to get in touch with the inner body, it is usually easier to focus on your breathing first. Conscious breathing, which is a powerful meditation in its own right, will gradually put you in touch with the body. Follow the breath with your attention as it moves in and out of your body. Breathe into the body, and feel your abdomen expanding and contracting slightly with each inhalation and exhalation. If you find it easy to visualize, close your eyes and see yourself surrounded by light or immersed in a luminous substance — a sea of consciousness. Then breathe in that light. Feel that luminous substance filling up your body and making it luminous also. Then gradually focus more on the feeling. You are now in your body. Don't get attached to any visual image.</p><p>当你发觉很难和内在身体运系的时候，通常先专注在呼吸上面比较容易。有意识地呼吸。这是一个相当有威力的冥想方式。它会逐渐让你和身体连系上。用你的注意力跟随呼吸进出你的身体。吸气进入体内。感觉你的腹部随着一呼一吸而微微地收缩和扩张。如果你发觉观想比较容易的话，闭上眼，观想自己被光包围，或者沉浸在一个透光体中——意识之海。接着把光吸进来。感觉光体充满你的身体，把它也变成透光体了。然后逐渐地更专注在感觉上面。你此刻在你的身体里。不要执着在任何的心像上面。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>§</p><p></p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>CREATIVE USE OF MIND</p><p>心智的创造力</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>If you need to use your mind for a specific purpose, use it in conjunction with your inner body. Only if you are able to be conscious without thought can you use your mind creatively, and the easiest way to enter that state is through your body. Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Become aware of the stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative. In any thought activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few minutes or so between thinking and an inner kind of listening, an inner stillness. We could say. don't just think with your head, think with your whole body.</p><p>如果你需要为一个特定的目的使用心智的话，把它和内在身体并用。只有当你能做到无思想、有意识的时候，才能发挥心智的创造力。进入这个状态最简易的方法就是透过你的身体。每当你需要一个答案、一个方案，或者创意的时候，把专注力集中在你内在的能场上，让思考暂停。觉察这份宁静。等你再恢复思考的时候，思考就变得新颖而有创意。在做任何思考活动的时候，养成习惯在思考和内在的倾听、内在静默之间，做几分钟的转换。另一种说法是：不要只用头脑思考，用你整个身体思考。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>§</p><p>∽</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>THE ART OF LISTENING</p><p>倾听的艺术</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>When listening to another person, don't just listen with your mind, listen with your whole body. Feel the energy field of your inner body as you listen. That takes attention away from thinking and creates a still space that enables you to truly listen without the mind interfering. You are giving the other person space — space to be. It is the most precious gift you can give. Most people don't know how to listen because the major part of their attention is taken up by thinking. They pay more attention to that than to what the other person is saying, and none at all to what really matters: the Being of the other person underneath the words and the mind. Of course, you cannot feel someone else's Being except through your own. This is the beginning of the realization of oneness, which is love. At the deepest level of Being, you are one with all that is.</p><p>听别人讲话的时候，不要只用心智，要用休整个身体倾听。倾听的时候，一面感觉你内在身体的能场。这样做会把注意力从思考移开，而创造出一个宁静的空间。让你在不受心智干扰的情况下，真正地聆听。你等于给了对方一个空间存在的空间。这是你能给出的礼物中，最珍贵的一个。大多数人不知道如何倾听，因为他们注意力的重心，被思考占据了。他们关注在思考的程度多过于对方说话的内容，而且完全疏忽了真正的重点：对方在话语和心智之下的本体（存在）。当然你只有透过自己的本体（存在），才能感觉到他人的本体（存在）。这就是体现合一，也就是爱的开始。在本体（存在）最深的层面上，你和万有皆是合一的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Most human relationships consist mainly of minds interacting with each other, not of human beings communicating, being in communion. No relationship can thrive in that way, and that is why there is so much conflict in relationships. When the mind is running your life, conflict, strife and problems are inevitable. Being in touch with your inner body creates a clear space of no-mind within which the relationship can flower.</p><p>许多人际关系只在心智的层面上互动，而不是人类的沟通和交流。任何关系都无法在这种方式下发展，这也是关系中充满冲突的原因。当心智主控着你的生命时，冲突、对峙、和问题便势所难免。和内在身体的连击，会创造一个无心的、清澈的空间，关系便在这个空间里滋长展开。</p></div>
