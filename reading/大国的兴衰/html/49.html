<p>CHAPTER ONE
<p>The Rise of the Western World
<p>1. W. H. McNeill, A World History (London, 1979 edn.), p. 295; idem, The Rise of
<p>the West (Chicago, 1967), p. 565; J. M. Roberts, The Pelican History of the World
<p>(Harmondsworth, Mdssx., 1980), p. 519; G. Barraclough (ed.), The Times Atlas
<p>of World History (London, 1978), p. 153.
<p>2. For surveys of international relations in Europe around 1500, see The New
<p>Cambridge Modern History (hereafter NCMH), vol. 1, The Renaissance 1493–
<p>1520, ed. G. R. Potter (Cambridge, 1961), espec. chs. 7–14; vol. 2, The
<p>Reformation 1520–1529, ed. G. R. Elton (Cambridge, 1958), chs. 10–11 and 16;

<p>Renaissance Diplomacy (Harmondsworth, Mddsx., 1965), pp. 115ff.
<p>3. There are succinct accounts of Ming China in McNeill, Rise of the West, pp. 524–
<p>34; and Roberts, History of the World, pp. 424–44. For more detail, C. O.
<p>Hucker, China’s Imperial Past (Stanford, Calif., 1975), pp. 303ff; J. A. Harrison,
<p>The Chinese Empire (New York, 1972); W. Eberhard, A History of China (2nd
<p>edn., London, 1960), pp. 232–70; M. Elvin, The Pattern of the Chinese Past
<p>(London, 1973).
<p>4. Y. Shiba, Commerce and Society in Sung China (Ann Arbor, Mich., 1970); J.
<p>Needham, The Development of Iron and Steel Technology in China (London, 1958);
<p>L.-S. Yang, Money and Credit in China (Cambridge, Mass., 1952); and espec. W.
<p>H. McNeill, The Pursuit of Power: Technology, Armed Forces and Society Since
<p>1000 A.D. (Chicago, 1983), ch. 2.
<p>5. The great source (in English) for the above is J. Needham, Science and
<p>Civilization in China, vol. 4, pt. 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics (Cambridge,
<p>1971), espec. pp. 379–536; but see also Lo Jung-pang, “The Emergence of
<p>China as a Sea Power During the Late Sung and Early Yuan Periods,” Far
<p>Eastern Quarterly, vol. 14 (1955), pp. 489–503; C. G. Reynolds, Command of the
<p>Sea: The History and Strategy of Maritime Empires (New York, 1974), pp. 98–104.
<p>6. For what follows, see McNeill, World History, pp. 254–55; Needham, Science
<p>and Civilization in China, vol. 4, pt. 3, pp. 524ff; R. Dawson, Imperial China
<p>(London, 1972), pp. 230ff; Lo Jung-pang, “The Decline of the Early Ming
<p>Navy,” Orient Extremus, vol. 5 (1958), pp. 149–68; and Ho Ping-Ti, “Economic
<p>and Institutional Factors in the Decline of the Chinese Empire,” in C. C. Cipolla
<p>(ed.), The Economic Decline of Empires (London, 1970), pp. 274–76, although in
<p>general the picture given is less gloomy than other accounts. See also the
<p>careful comparisons in J. Needham, The Grand Titration: Science and Society in
<p>East and West (London, 1969), passim; and in E. L. Jones, The European Miracle:
<p>Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia

<p>The Making of Modern Russia (Harmondsworth, Mddsx., 2nd edn., 1983), chs.
<p>3–6.
<p>14. See Roberts, History of the World, p. 585: “So little was Russia known even in
<p>the [seventeenth] century that a French king could write to the Tsar, not
<p>knowing that the prince whom he addressed had been dead for ten years.”
<p>Note also the condescending remarks of English traders in Russia in Kochan
<p>and Abraham, Making of Modern Russia, pp. 56–57.
<p>15. This is the title, of course, of E. L. Jones’s impressive book. It, and the
<p>important work by W. H. McNeill, The Pursuit of Power, have strongly
<p>influenced my argument in the following paragraphs. See also McNeill, Rise of
<p>the West, passim; Wallerstein, Modern World System; D. C. North and R. P.
<p>Thomas, The Rise of the Western World (Cambridge, 1973); J. H. Parry, The

<p>21. One is bound to put quotation marks around the word “national,” since so
<p>many men in the French army were mercenaries: see V. G. Kiernan, “Foreign
<p>Mercenaries and Absolute Monarchy,” Past and Present, vol. 11 (1957), p. 72.

<p>1650 (Berkeley, Calif., 1981), which places the fifteenth-century voyages in the
<p>broader sweep of European expansionism.
<p>25. Jones, European Miracle, p. 80. The importance of “efficient economic
<p>organization” is also repeatedly stressed in North and Thomas, Rise of the
<p>Western World, p. 1 and passim.
<p>26. This is the thrust of Guilmartin’s excellent study, Gunpowder and Galleys,
<p>passim.

<p>York, 1969); and compare with the much less satisfactory (and irregular)
<p>situation prior to 1688: C. D. Chandaman, The English Public Revenue 1660–

<p>Dutch finance in Britain’s growth is also stressed (and perhaps exaggerated) in
<p>Wallerstein, Modern World System, vol. 2, pp. 279ff; but note also the
<p>interesting arguments in L. Neal, “Interpreting Power and Profit in Economic

<p>16. The most useful study here is J. F. Bosher, French Finances, 1770–1795 <p>(Cambridge, 1970); but see also the articles by Dickson and Sperling, “War
<p>Finance,” and Mathias and O’Brien, “Taxation in Britain and France,” as well as

<p>17. Bosher, French Finances 1770–1795, p. 20. This argument is summarized in

<p>siphoned off into private hands, see Mathias and O’Brien, “Taxation in Britain

<p>Economy During the Eighteenth Century (Baltimore/London, 1981), pp. 23, 226;
<p>and see in particular chs. 1 and 7, as well as the conclusion. That story can be
<p>compared with the British experience, as recounted in R. Davis, The Rise of the
<p>Atlantic Economies (London, 1975); W. E. Minchinton (ed.), The Growth of
<p>English Overseas Trade in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (London,
<p>1969); A. Calder, Revolutionary Empire: The Rise of the English-Speaking Empires
<p>from the Fifteenth Century to the 1780s (London, 1981), bks. 2–3; as well as a

<p>Equipment” in L. Kennet, The French Armies in the Seven Years War: A Study in
<p>Military Organization and Administration (Durham, N.C., 1967). For the navy’s
<p>weaknesses, particularly with respect to provisions and timber, see P. W. Barnford,
<p>Forests and French Sea Power 1660–1789 (Toronto, 1956), passim; and
<p>Jenkins, History of the French Navy, ch. 8; and the remarkable analysis by J. F.
<p>Bosher, “Financing the French Navy in the Seven Years War: Beaujon, Goossens
<p>et compagnie in 1759,” to be published in U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings. For a
<p>British comparison, see D. A. Baugh, British Naval Administration in the Age of
<p>Walpole (Princeton, 1965), passim.
<p>20. For these comparative statistics, see Bosher, French Finances 1770–1795, pp.
<p>23–24. This can be supplemented by R. D. Harris, “French Finances and the
<p>American War, 1777–1783,” Journal of Modern History, vol. 46, no. 2 (1976),
<p>pp. 233–58; G. Ardent, “Financial Policy and Economic Infrastructure of

<p>Western Europe, pp. 217ff; Hamilton, “Origin and Growth of the National Debt
<p>in Western Europe,” pp. 122–24. The place of taxation in the French crisis of
<p>the late 1780s is delineated in Doyle, The Old European Order, pp. 313–20; and
<p>NCMH, vol. 8, chs. 20–21. For Pitt’s reforms, see J. Ehrman, The Younger Pitt, 2 <p>vols. to date (London, 1969 and 1983), vol. 1, pp. 239ff; and J.E.D. Binney,
<p>British Public Finance and Administration, 1774–1792 (Oxford, 1958), passim.
<p>21. There is no prospect of giving a satisfactory (let alone an exhaustive) list of
<p>references to the war finance of these other states. In general see Tilly (ed.),
<p>Formation of National States in Western Europe, chs. 3–4; NCMH, vol. 6, pp. 20ff,
<p>284ff; and C. Moraze, “Finance et despotisme, essai sur les despotes eclaires,”

<p>The Army of Maria Theresa: The Armed Forces of Imperial Austria, 1740–1780 <p>(London, 1977), ch. 10. Even in Russia’s case, where conscription operated and
<p>the resources of the country were ransacked for military purposes, the earlier
<p>self-sufficiency in cash and kind had been replaced by an increasing recourse to
<p>foreign loans and paper money by the final decade of the eighteenth century;

<p>170. Again, the literature on the American strategy and conduct of the war is
</p>
<p>already overwhelming. Millett and Maslowski, For the Common Defense, ch. 17,
</p>
<p>is a good summary. H. G. Summers, On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the

</p>
<p>pressure from foreign foes (e.g., Israel), it seems inappropriate to employ that
</p>
<p>term. On the other hand, the historical record suggests that if a particular
</p>
<p>nation is allocating over the long term more than 10 percent (and in some cases
</p>
<p>—when it is structurally weak—more than 5 percent) of GNP to armaments,
</p>
