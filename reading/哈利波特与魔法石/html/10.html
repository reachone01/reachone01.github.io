<div class='layout'><p>CHAPTER TEN: HALLOWEEN</p><p>第10章万圣节前夜</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. </p><p>第二天，马尔福简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，他看见哈利和罗恩居然还在霍格沃茨，虽然显得有些疲倦，但非常开心。确实，哈利和罗恩第二天一早醒来，都觉得看见那条三个脑袋的大狗是一次很精彩的奇遇，巴不得再经历一次。而且，哈利原原本本地对罗恩讲了那个似乎已从古灵阁转移到了霍格沃茨的小包裹，于是他们花了许多时间猜测，是什么东西需要这样严加看守。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron. </p><p>「它要么特别宝贵，要么特别危险。」罗恩说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Or both," said Harry.</p><p>「或者两项全占了。」哈利说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.</p><p>但是，关于那个神秘物件，他们惟一能够确定的只是它的长度有两英寸。如果没有更多的线索，是不可能猜到它是什么东西的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.</p><p>纳威和赫敏对于大狗和活板下面藏着什么，似乎一点也不感兴趣。纳威只想着千万别再走近那只大狗。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.</p><p>赫敏现在不答理哈利和罗恩了。她一向自以为是，喜欢发号施令，所以他们倒觉得这是一件意外的好事。他们现在最希望的就是对马尔福进行报复，令他们高兴的是，大约一个星期后，这样的机会就随着邮差一起到来了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.</p><p>当猫头鹰们像往常一样拥进大餐厅时，每个人的注意力都被由六只长耳猫头鹰驮着的细长包裹吸引住了。哈利和别人一样渴望知道这个包裹里是什么。没想到，几只猫头鹰盘旋而下，正好落在他面前，把他的熏咸肉碰落到地板上。他惊讶极了。它们扑扇着翅膀刚刚飞走，又有一只猫头鹰携来一封信，扔在包裹上。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:</p><p>哈利首先把信撕开——幸亏他这么做了——只见信上写着：</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.</p><p>不要打开桌上的包裹。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session.</p><p> 里面装着你新的飞天扫帚光轮2000， 我不想让大家知道你有了新扫帚， 免得他们都想要。 奥利弗伍德今晚七点 在魁地奇球场等你， 给你上第一堂训练课。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Professor McGonagall</p><p>米麦格教授</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.</p><p>哈利把短信递给罗恩，掩饰不住内心的喜悦。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched one."</p><p>「光轮2000！」罗恩羡慕地感叹道，「我连碰都没有碰过。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.</p><p>他们匆匆离开大厅，想赶在第一节课之前，找个没人的地方拆开包裹，拿出飞天扫帚。可是，就在穿过门厅时，他们发现上楼的路被克拉布和高尔挡住了。马尔福把包裹从哈利手里夺过去，摸了摸。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them."</p><p>「是一把飞天扫帚。」他说，一边把包裹扔还给哈利，脸上混杂着嫉妒和怨恨的表情。「你等着挨罚吧，波特，一年级学生是不许玩这个的。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Ron couldn't resist it.</p><p>罗恩按捺不住了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"It's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus."</p><p>「这不是什么旧型飞天扫帚，」他说，「这是光轮2000。你说你在家里有一把什么来着，马尔福？彗星260？」罗恩对哈利咧着嘴大笑。「彗星倒是挺耀眼的，但它们和光轮根本不是一个档次。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig."</p><p>「你怎么知道，韦斯莱，你连半个扫帚把都弄不到。」马尔福凶巴巴地回敬道，「我猜你和你那些兄弟不得不一根枝子一根枝子地攒吧。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.</p><p>罗恩还没来得及回答，弗立维教授在马尔福胳膊肘边出现了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked.</p><p>「我希望不是在吵架吧，孩子们？」他尖着嗓子问。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly.</p><p>「有人给波特捎来一把飞天扫帚，教授。」马尔福忙不迭地说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. "Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?"</p><p>「是啊，是啊，是这样的。」弗立维教授说着，朝哈利绽开笑容。「麦格教授把情况的特殊性都跟我说了，波特。是什么型号的？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it," he added.</p><p>「光轮2000，先生。」哈利说。看到马尔福脸上惊恐的表情，他拼命克制着不笑出来。「我能得到它，还多亏了这位马尔福呢。」他补充道。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. </p><p>哈利和罗恩往楼上走去。他们看到马尔福那副明显愤怒和迷惑的样子，不得不使劲把笑忍住。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."</p><p>「真的，我说的是实话，」当他们来到大理石楼梯顶上时，哈利咯咯地笑着说，「如果不是他偷了纳威的玻璃球，我就进不了球队……」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.</p><p>「所以你认为这是对你违反校规的奖励吗？」他们俩身后传来一个愤怒的声音。赫敏噔噔地走上楼来，不满地看着哈利手里的包裹。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry.</p><p>「我还以为你不跟我们说话了呢。」哈利说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good."</p><p>「是啊，现在也别说，」罗恩说，「这使我们感到很舒服。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.</p><p>赫敏大踏步地走开了，鼻子扬得高高的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.</p><p>那天，哈利很难定下心来认真听课。他的思绪不住地飞向宿舍，他的新飞天扫帚就躺在他的床底下。他还不时地想到他今晚就要去训练的魁地奇球场。晚饭时他三口两口咽下食物，根本没有注意吃的是什么，然后和罗恩一起迅速奔上楼梯，终于可以打开光轮2000了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.</p><p>「哇！」当飞天扫帚滚落在哈利的床单上时，罗恩惊叹道。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.</p><p>就连对飞天扫帚的种类一无所知的哈利，也认为这把飞天扫帚简直太捧了。线条优美，富有光泽，把是红木的，长长的尾巴用整齐、笔直的枝子扎成，「光轮2000」几个字金灿灿地印在扫帚把顶端。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p> As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.</p><p>七点钟越来越近了，哈利离开城堡，朝暮色中的魁地奇球场走去。几百张椅子高高地排放在周围的看台上，使观众都能看见球场上的情况。球场两端各有三根金制的杆子，顶上带着圆环。它们使哈利想起麻瓜的小孩子们吹肥皂泡用的小塑料棍，只是它们每根都有五十英尺高。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.</p><p>哈利太想再飞上天去了，他等不及伍德，便骑上他的飞天扫帚，双脚一蹬地面。多么美妙的滋味——他快速地在球门柱间穿梭，又在球场上空忽上忽下地飞翔。他只需轻轻一碰，光轮2000就转向他需要的方向。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Hey, Potter, come down!'</p><p>「喂，波特，下来！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.</p><p>是奥利弗伍德来了。他胳膊下夹着一只很大的木板箱。哈利降落在他旁边。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."</p><p>「非常精彩。」伍德说，眼睛闪闪发亮。「我明白麦格教授的意思了……你确实是个天才。我今晚就把规则教给你，然后你就可以参加队里每周三次的训练了。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.</p><p>他打开木板箱，里面是四个大小不等的球。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers."</p><p>「好，」伍德说，「是这样，魁地奇球的规则很容易理解，尽管玩起来并不容易。每边七个人，其中三个被称为追球手。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.</p><p> 「三个追球手。」哈利重复道。 这时伍德拿出一只足球那么大的鲜红的球。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?"</p><p>「这个球叫做鬼飞球。」伍德说，「追球手互相传递鬼飞球，争取让它通过一个圆环，这样便可以得分。鬼飞球每次通过一个圆环，就可以得十分。明白了吗？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score," Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?"</p><p>「追球手把鬼飞球投出去，让它穿过圆环，便可以得分了。」哈利复述道。「这么说——这是一种用飞天扫帚和六个圆环玩的篮球，是吗？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. </p><p>「篮球是什么？」伍德好奇地问。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Never mind," said Harry quickly.</p><p>「没什么。」哈利赶紧说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring."</p><p>「好吧，每边还有另一个队员，叫守门员——我就是格兰芬多队的守门员。我必须在我们的圆环周围飞来飞去，不让对方得分。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. "And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.</p><p>「三个追球手，一个守门员。」哈利说，决心把这些都记在心里。「他们打的是鬼飞球。行，明白了。那么这些是做什么用的？」他指着留在箱子里的另外三个球问。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this."</p><p>「我现在就演示给你看。」伍德说，「你拿着这个。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.</p><p>他递给哈利一根小木棒，有点像跑柱式棒球的球棒。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. "These two are the Bludgers."</p><p>「我来让你看看游走球是做什么用的。」伍德说，「这两个就是游走球。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.</p><p>他拿给哈利看两只一模一样的球，它们黑得发亮，比刚才的红色鬼飞球略小一些。哈利注意到，它们似乎在拼命挣扎，想摆脱把它们束缚在箱子里的皮带。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.</p><p>「往后站。」伍德提醒哈利。他弯下腰，松开一只游走球。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.</p><p>顿时，那只黑球嗖地蹿上半空，然后径直朝哈利脸上打来。哈利眼看它要撞碎自己的鼻子，赶紧用短棒拦截，打得它重新左拐右拐地蹿向空中——它在他们头顶上呼呼盘旋，然后又突然朝伍德冲来。伍德猛地伸手罩住它，把它牢牢按在地面上。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you've got all that?"</p><p>「看到了吧？」伍德喘着气说，一边使劲把游走球塞进木箱，用皮带结结实实地拴好。「游走球飞来蹿去，想把球手们从飞天扫帚上打落。所以，每一边还有两个击球手。韦斯莱孪生兄弟就是我们队的击球手——他们的工作是保护我方球员不被游走球打中，并把游走球击向对方球员。所以——你都听明白了吧？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry reeled off.</p><p>「三个追球手争取用鬼飞球得分；守门员看守球门柱；击球手不让游走球撞伤自己的队员。」哈利一口气说道。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Very good," said Wood.</p><p>「很好。」伍德说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.</p><p>「嗯……游走球有没有打死过人？」哈利问道，希望他的口气显得很随便。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p> "Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open."</p><p> 「在霍格沃茨从来没有。有一两个人被撞碎了下巴，仅此而已。好了，队里最后一名球员是找球手。那就是你。你不用去管鬼飞球和游走球……」 「……除非它们把我的脑袋撞开了花。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves."</p><p>「不用担心，韦斯莱兄弟对付游走球绰绰有余——说实在的，他们自己就像两只游走球。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.</p><p>伍德又把手伸进木板箱，拿出第四只也是最后一只球。这只球与鬼飞球和游走球相比，显得很小，约摸只有一只大胡桃那么大。它金灿灿的，还有不断扇动着的银色小翅膀。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p> "This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.</p><p>「这个，」伍德说，「就是金色飞贼，是所有球当中最重要的。你很难抓住它，它飞得像闪电一般快，根本看不清。找球手的工作就是要把它抓住。你必须在追球手、击球手、游走球和鬼飞球之间来回穿梭，赶在对方找球手之前把它抓住。如果哪个队的找球手抓住了金色飞贼，他的队就能额外赢得一百五十分，差不多就是稳操胜券了。只有当金色飞贼被抓住时，魁地奇比赛才算结束，所以有时候一场比赛会持续好多日子——我想最高记录大概是三个月吧，他们不得不找替补队员上场，把球手们换下来睡一会儿觉。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p> "Well, that's it -- any questions?"</p><p>「行了，就是这样——还有问题吗？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.</p><p>哈利摇了摇头。他明白自己需要做什么了，但究竟能不能做好还很成问题。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few of these."</p><p>「我们先不拿飞贼来训练，」伍德说着，小心地把它放进箱子里关了起来。「天太黑了，我们会把它丢失的。我们就用几只这样的球让你训练吧。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.</p><p>他从口袋里掏出一袋普通的高尔夫球，几分钟后，他和哈利就到了空中。伍德使出吃奶的力气，把高尔夫球掷往各个方向，让哈利去接。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.</p><p>哈利百发百中，一个球都没有漏过，伍德非常高兴。过了半小时，天完全黑透了，他们无法再训练了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."</p><p>「今年的魁地奇杯上将刻上我们的名字。」当他们疲倦地走回城堡时，伍德兴高采烈地说，「如果你表现得比查理韦斯莱还要出色，我一点儿也不会吃惊。他如果没有去研究龙，肯定会代表英国队参赛的。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.</p><p>也许是因为现在太忙了——除了各门功课的家庭作业之外，还有每周三个晚上的魁地奇训练——所以，当哈利突然意识到自己在霍格沃茨已经整整待了两个月时，他简直感到难以置信。城堡一天比一天更像家了，而他在女贞路时从来没有这样的感觉。当一些基础知识被掌握了之后，他的功课也变得越来越有趣了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.</p><p>万圣节前夕，他们一早醒来，就闻到走廊里飘着一般香甜诱人的烤南瓜的气味。更妙的是，弗立维教授在魔法课上宣布。他认为他们可以开始使物体飞起来了。同学们自从看见弗立维教授把纳威的癞蛤蟆弄得在教室里到处乱飞之后，就一直眼巴巴地希望尝试一下这种技能。弗立维教授把全班同学分成两个人一组开始训练。哈利的搭档是西莫斐尼甘（谢天谢地，因为纳威一直想跟他交换）。而罗恩呢，要和赫敏格兰杰一起合作。关于这件事，很难说清罗恩和赫敏谁更加恼火一点儿。赫敏自从哈利的飞天扫帚送到的那天起，就一直不跟他们俩说话。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest."</p><p>「好了，千万不要忘记我们一直在训练的那个微妙的手腕动作！」弗立维教授像往常一样站在他的那堆书上，尖声说道，「一挥一抖，记住，一挥一抖。念准咒语也非常重要——千万别忘了巴鲁费奥巫师，他把『f』说成了『s』，结果发现自己躺在地板上，胸口上站着一头野牛。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.</p><p>做起来很不容易。哈利和西莫一挥一抖，一挥一抖，做了一遍又一遍，但应该被他们送上空中的羽毛还是一动不动地躺在地板上。西莫一气之下，用魔杖朝羽毛一捅，羽毛着火了——哈利不得不用他的帽子将火扑灭。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.</p><p>在另一个桌子上的罗恩，运气似乎也好不到哪里去。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.</p><p>「羽加迪姆勒维奥萨！」他大声喊道，一边像风车一样挥动着两条长长的手臂。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."</p><p>「你说错了，」哈利听见赫敏毫不客气地说，「是羽加——迪姆勒维奥萨，那个『加』字要说得又长又清楚。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.</p><p>「既然你这么机灵，你倒来试试看，」罗恩咆哮着说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "Wingardium Leviosa!"</p><p>赫敏卷起衣袖，挥动着魔杖，说道：「羽加迪姆勒维奥萨！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.</p><p>他们的那根羽毛从桌上升起来，飘悬在他们头顶上方四英尺的地方。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!"</p><p>「哦，做得好！」弗立维教授挥着手喊道，「大家快看，格兰杰小姐已经成功了！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. </p><p>到了快下课的时候，罗恩的情绪坏到了极点。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"It's no wonder no one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. "</p><p>「怪不得大家都受不了她，」他对哈利说，这时他们正在拥挤的走廊里费力穿行，「说实在的，她简直就像一个噩梦。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.</p><p>有人撞了哈利一下，又匆匆从他们身边走了过去。是赫敏。哈利瞥见了她的脸——他惊讶地发现她在掉眼泪。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"I think she heard you."</p><p>「我想她听见你的话了。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed she's got no friends."</p><p>「那又怎么样？」罗恩说，但也显出了一丝不安。「她一定已经注意到了，她一个朋友也没有。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.</p><p>下一节课赫敏没有露面，而且整个下午都不见人影。哈利和罗恩下楼走向餐厅，去参加万圣节前夕的宴会，无意间听见佩蒂尔对她的朋友拉文德说，赫敏在女厕所里伤心地哭泣，还不让别人安慰她。罗恩听了这话，显得更不自在了。然而片刻之后，当他们走进餐厅、看见五光十色的万圣节装饰品时，立刻就把赫敏忘到了脑后。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.</p><p>一千只蝙蝠在墙壁和天花板上扑棱棱地飞翔，另外还有一千只像一团团低矮的乌云，在餐桌上方盘旋飞舞，使南瓜肚里的蜡烛火苗一阵阵扑闪。美味佳肴突然出现在金色的盘子里，就跟在开学的那次宴会上一样。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know."</p><p>哈利正在吃一个带皮的土豆，奇洛教授突然一头冲进了餐厅，他的大围巾歪戴在头上，脸上满是惊恐的神色。大家都盯着他，只见他走到邓布利多教授的椅子旁，一歪身倚在桌子上，喘着气说：「巨怪……在地下教室里……以为你应该知道的。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.</p><p>说完，他一头栽到在地板上，昏死了过去。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.</p><p>餐厅里顿时乱成一团。邓布利多教授不得不使他的魔杖头上发出几次刺耳的烟火爆炸声，大家才安静下来。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!"</p><p>「级长，」他声音低沉地说，「立刻把你们学院的学生领到宿舍去！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Percy was in his element.</p><p>珀西自然是驾轻就熟。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!"</p><p>「跟我来！不要走散了，一年级学生！只要你们听我的吩咐，就不用害怕什么巨怪！好了，紧紧跟在我后面。闪开，一年级学生要通过了！请原谅，我是级长！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.</p><p>「巨怪怎么能钻进来呢？」他们上楼梯时，哈利问道。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke."</p><p>「不要问我，巨怪们应该都傻得出奇，」罗恩说，「也许是皮皮鬼把它放进来的，为了给万圣节前夜增加点儿乐子。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.</p><p>路上，他们遇到了一些匆匆赶往不同方向的人群。当他们费力挤过一堆神情困惑的赫奇帕奇学院的学生时，哈利猛地抓住罗恩的手臂。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"I've just thought -- Hermione."</p><p>「我刚想起来——赫敏。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"What about her?"</p><p>「她怎么啦？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"She doesn't know about the troll."</p><p>「她还不知道巨怪的事。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Ron bit his lip.</p><p>罗恩咬着嘴唇。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."</p><p>「噢，好吧，」他果断地说，「但最好别让珀西看见我们。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.</p><p>他们埋下身子，混在赫奇帕奇的人群里，朝另一个方向走去。他们悄悄溜过空荡荡的侧面走廊，急匆匆地赶往女厕所。刚转过拐角，就听见身后传来了急促的脚步声。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.</p><p>「珀西！」罗恩压低声音说道，拉着哈利躲到一个很大的狮身鹰首兽石雕后面。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.</p><p>他们从石雕后面望过去，却发现不是珀西，而是斯内普。他穿过走廊，从他们的视线中消失了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?"</p><p>「他在做什么？」哈利低声问道，「他为什么不和其他老师一起，待在下面的地下教室里？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Search me."</p><p>「我怎么知道！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.</p><p>他们跟着斯内普渐渐远去的脚步声，悄悄顺着另一道走廊向前走，尽量不发出声音。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.</p><p>「他在朝三楼走呢。」哈利说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Can you smell something?"</p><p>但是罗恩举起了手，「你能闻到什么吗？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.</p><p>哈利吸了吸鼻子，一股恶臭钻进他的鼻孔，那是一种臭袜子和从来无人打扫的公共厕所混合在一起的气味。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.</p><p>接着他们听见了一阵低沉的咕哝声和巨大的脚掌拖在地上走路的声音。罗恩注意到：在左边一条通道的尽头，一个庞然大物正向他们这边移动。他们赶紧退缩到暗处，注视着它慢慢走进一片月光。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.</p><p>那景象十分恐怖。它足有十二英尺高，皮肤暗淡无光，像花岗岩一般灰乎乎的，庞大而蠢笨的身体像一堆巨大的泥砾，上面顶着一个可可豆一般的小脑袋。它的短腿粗壮得像树桩，下面是扁平的、粗硬起茧的大脚。它身上散发出的那股气味臭得令人作呕。它手里抓着一根粗大的木棍，由于它的手臂很长，木棍在地上拖着。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.</p><p>巨怪停在一个门边，朝里面窥视。它摆动着长耳朵，用它的小脑袋做出了决定，然后垂下头，慢慢钻进了房间。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in."</p><p>「钥匙在锁眼里呢，」哈利喃喃地低语，「我们可以把它锁在里面。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Good idea," said Ron nervously.</p><p>「好主意。」罗恩紧张地说。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.</p><p>他们侧着身子走向敞开的门，觉得嘴里发干，一心只希望巨怪不要突然跑出来。哈利大步一跳，把钥匙抓在手里，猛地撞上门，牢牢锁住。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Yes!"</p><p>「成了！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up.</p><p>他们因为得手而兴奋得满脸通红，开始顺着通道往回跑，可是，刚跑到拐弯处，就听见了一个几乎使他们的心脏停止跳动的声音——一个凄厉的、惊恐万状的声音——是从他们刚刚锁上的房间里传出来的。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.</p><p>「哦，糟糕。」罗恩说，脸色苍白得像血人巴罗的鬼魂。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped.</p><p>「那是女厕所！」哈利连气都透不过来了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Hermione!" they said together.</p><p>「赫敏！」两人同时说道。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.</p><p>他们真不愿意再回去，可是还有什么别的选择呢？他们猛一转身，奔回那道门前，拧动钥匙，因为紧张而显得笨手笨脚——哈利把门拉开，两人冲了进去。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.</p><p>赫敏格兰杰缩在对面的墙边，似乎随时都有可能晕倒。巨怪正在朝她逼近，它一边走，一边把水池撞得与墙脱开了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.</p><p>「把它搞糊涂！」哈利孤注一掷地对罗恩说，一边抓起一个水龙头，使劲朝墙上扔去。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.</p><p>巨怪在离赫敏几步远的地方停住了。它笨拙地转过身来，愚蠢地眨巴着小眼睛，想看清声音是什么东西发出来的。它那丑陋的小眼睛看见了哈利。它迟疑了一下，然后便朝哈利走来，一边举起手里的木棍。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.</p><p>「嘿，大笨蛋！」罗恩从房间另一边喊道，同时把一根金属管朝巨怪扔去。巨怪似乎根本没有注意到金属管打中了它的肩膀，但它听见了喊声，便又停住脚步，把丑陋的大鼻子转向了罗恩，哈利趁此机会绕到它的身后。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.</p><p>「过来，快跑，快跑！」哈利朝赫敏喊道，想把她拉向门口，但是她动弹不得，仍然紧紧地贴在墙上，嘴巴惊恐地张得老大。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.</p><p> 喊声和回音似乎把巨怪逼得发狂了。它又咆哮了一声，开始向罗恩逼近。 罗恩离巨怪最近，而且没有退路。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.</p><p>这时，哈利做了一件非常勇敢但又十分愚蠢的事：他猛地向前一跳，用双臂从后面搂住了巨怪的脖子。巨怪是不会感觉到哈利吊在它身上的，但如果你把一根长长的木头插进它的鼻子，巨怪就不可能毫无感觉了。哈利在跳起时手里拿着魔杖——它径直插进了巨怪的一个鼻孔。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.</p><p>巨怪痛苦地吼叫起来，扭动着身子，连连挥舞手里的木棍，哈利死死地搂住它不放；巨怪随时都会把他甩下来，然后抓住他，用木棍给他可怕的一击。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"</p><p>赫敏吓呆了，扑通瘫倒在地板上；罗恩抽出自己的魔杖——他正不知道该怎么办呢，却听见自己喊出了脑子里想到的第一句咒语：「羽加迪姆勒维奥萨！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.</p><p>木棍突然从巨怪手里飞出，高高地、高高地升向空中，又慢慢转了个身——落下来，敲在它主人的头上，发出惊天动地的一声爆响。巨怪原地摇摆了一下，面朝下倒在地板上，轰隆一声，把整个房间都震得发抖。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.</p><p>哈利爬起身来。他浑身颤抖，气喘吁吁。罗恩站在那里，瞪眼看着自己所做的事情，魔杖还高高地举在手里。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>It was Hermione who spoke first.</p><p>最后是赫敏先开口说话了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Is it -- dead?"</p><p>「它——死了吗？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out."</p><p>「我认为没有，」哈利说，「它大概只是被打昏了。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.</p><p>他弯下腰，从巨怪的鼻子里拔出自己的魔杖，那上面沾着一大块一大块灰色的胶状物质。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Urgh -- troll boogers."</p><p>「呸！巨怪的鼻子牛儿。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>He wiped it on the troll's trousers.</p><p>他把魔杖在巨怪的裤子上擦了擦。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. </p><p>突然传来一阵猛烈的撞门声和响亮的脚步声，房间里的三个人都抬起头来。他们没有意识到刚才闹出了多么大的动静，一定是楼下的人听见了剧烈的碰撞声和巨怪的吼叫声。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.</p><p>片刻之后，麦格教授冲进了房间，后面紧跟着斯内普，奇洛在最后。奇洛只朝巨怪看了一眼，就发出了一阵无力的抽泣，坐在一个抽水马桶上，紧紧攥住自己的胸口。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.</p><p>斯内普弯下腰去看巨怪。麦格教授看着罗恩和哈利。哈利从未见过她这么生气的样子。她的嘴唇煞白。为格兰芬多赢得五十分的希望迅速从哈利脑海中消失了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your dormitory?"</p><p>「你们到底在玩什么鬼把戏？」麦格教授说，声音里带着冷冰冰的愤怒。哈利看着罗恩，只见他仍然高举着魔杖站在那里。「算你们走运，没有被它弄死。你们为什么不老老实实待在宿舍里？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.</p><p>斯内普用逼人的目光迅速剜了哈利一眼。哈利看着地上，他希望罗恩赶紧把魔杖放下来。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Then a small voice came out of the shadows.</p><p>这时，阴影里传来一个低低的声音。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me."</p><p>「请别这样，麦格教授——他们是在找我。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Miss Granger!"</p><p>「格兰杰小姐！」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.</p><p>赫敏终于挣扎着站了起来。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them."</p><p>「我来找巨怪，因为我……我以为我能独自对付它……你知道，因为我在书上读到过它们，对它们很了解。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Ron dropped his wand. </p><p>罗恩放下了魔杖。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived."</p><p>赫敏格兰杰对一位老师撒下了弥天大谎——「如果他们没有找到我，我现在肯定已经死了。哈利把他的魔杖插进了巨怪的鼻孔，罗恩用巨怪自己的木棍把它打昏了过去。他们来不及去找人。他们赶来的时候，巨怪正要把我一口吞掉。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.</p><p>哈利和罗恩竭力装出一副早已熟悉这个故事的样子。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?"</p><p>「噢——如果是这样……」麦格教授注视着他们，沉吟道，「格兰杰小姐，你这个傻姑娘，你怎么能认为你独自就能对付一个大山般的巨怪呢？」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.</p><p>赫敏垂下了头。哈利一句话也说不出来。赫敏是最不可能违反校规的人，而现在，她为了使他们摆脱麻烦，居然撒谎说自己违反了校规。这简直就像斯内普开始给大家发糖一样，令人难以置信。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses."</p><p>「格兰杰小姐，因为这件事，格兰芬多要被扣去五分，」麦格教授说，「我对你感到很失望。如果你一点儿也没有受伤，最好赶紧回格兰芬多城堡去。学生们都在自己的学院里享用万圣节晚宴呢。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Hermione left.</p><p>赫敏离去了。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.</p><p>麦格教授转向哈利和罗恩。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."</p><p>「好吧，我仍然要说算你们走运，没有几个一年级学生能同一个成年的巨怪展开较量的。你们每人为格兰芬多赢得了五分。我会把这件事通知邓布利多教授的。你们可以走了。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.</p><p>他们急忙走出房间，一言不发地上了两层楼梯。总算闻不到巨怪身上的恶臭了，他们松了口气。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled.</p><p>「我们应该赢得不止十分。」罗恩嘟嘟囔囔地抱怨。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's."</p><p>「只有五分，算上她在赫敏身上扣掉的分数。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind you, we did save her."</p><p>「赫敏真好，她挺身而出，使我们摆脱了麻烦。」罗恩承认道，「不过你别忘了，我们确实救了她。」</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her," Harry reminded him.</p><p>「如果我们没有把她和那东西关在一起，她也许根本就不用别人去救。」哈利提醒他。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.</p><p>他们来到胖夫人的肖像前面。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>"Pig snout," they said and entered.</p><p>「猪鼻子。」他们说完口令，就钻了进去。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.</p><p>公共休息室里挤满了人，吵吵闹闹的。每个人都在吃着送上来的食物。只有赫敏独自站在门口，等着他们。一时间，三个人都很尴尬。接着，他们谁也没看谁，只同时说了一句「谢谢你」，就匆匆奔向自己的盘子。</p></div>	
<div class='layout'><p>But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.</p><p>然而就从那一刻起，赫敏格兰杰成了他们的朋友。当你和某人共同经历了某个事件之后，你们之间不能不产生好感，而打昏一个十二英尺高的巨怪就是一个这样的事件。</p></div>
